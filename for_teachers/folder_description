This folder is for updating Luca and Michele on our project progress. 

The "politics.png" is the first projected network made. 
Every node is a user who has both commmented a post and made a post within our set criteria. 
The nodes are colored based on the embedding score we got from usinf Sentencetransformers and then PCA-ing the comments to one dimension. 
The edges are colored based on the comments sentiment, green edges being positive and red being negative. 

A pretrained huggingface transformer model has been used for the sentiment analysis and was tested on 8000 tweets where it had a ~70% accuracy.
