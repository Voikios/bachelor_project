sadroobeer,Bro upgrade those lights lol
NUTmegEnjoyer,"Are you pulling down? Because that's how it kinda looks like for the MP7 there. 

If you didn't, these are really great changes."
Over_Statistician913,Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Allen's recoil.
Carl_Slaygan,"holy shit its like an adult human is controlling them, instead of the absolute fetus holding the gun before"
Tocki92,Did they buff all the weapons or just those two? Is aug1/3 included?:)
6francs,I donâ€™t know maybe you can turn the light on or go on an offline raid. Would be way easier to see
marshaln,OMG my PMC doesn't have noodles for arms. Maybe it's time to try this wipe
DJJ0SHWA,I'd still like them to reduce first shot recoil to make semi auto more viable. But this is a good start
DilWig,"imagine a little number update that took them like 2 days to apply was enough to solve a whole issue that we had for like 3 wipes, this showcases that they really just want you to suffer until we basicly riot and try to ruin the game reputation online.."
ShinyRayquazaEUW,"AMMO:  
856A1 and FMJ SX.  
You can see the builds at the end of the clip.   
I am pulling down the initial 3-4 bullet climb while crouched and then I am just holding it."
DevilJabanero,When did they update?
beqs171,What reoil is this m4 and what ammo are you using gor the mp7
GZero_Airsoft,"Still not happy with recoil, it still pivots up like a pistol shooting even though its a rifle. First shot vertical recoil on semi is the real problem, still doesnt end full auto meta with auto recoil control.

If they reduce first shot or 3 burst vertical recoil semi and burst would be viable, and keep horizontal the same or make it get progressively worse in full auto and the skill reduces the % of horizontal getting worse in full auto so the skill is not useless. Then we will stop seeing laser beam full auto rifles and more people taking calculated shots/bursts."
ApeOfDiamondz,"Base mp7 too. Looks great! Canâ€™t wait to try it. 

Thanks for sharing."
PanProjektor,Laser is back on the menu boys
Nightxax,"""The chads are gonna be so more OP now guys! Now they can aim and shoot where they intend their bullets to go! THIS IS NOT FAIR! BRING BACK THE OLD RNG CLUSTER FUCK RECOIL SYSTEM. WHAT THE HELL NIKITA!"""
YourAverageGiant6-6,You kind of ruin the test by manually pulling down to compensate...
kojimbooo,That's a crazy beam on the M4 with those mid parts while scoped in.
3Foss,"This is fucking sick, now remove/reduce stamina drain from being hit - then we are gaming"
Sesleri,"The recoilDispersion stat they changed seems to be the totally random recoil, so a lot of horizontal recoil is removed but a lot of guns still pull up.

The guns that totally depended on this stat for any recoil (like MP7) are ridiculous now.  

AS VAL and VSS totally left out of these changes, they are horrible now.  MPX, MCX still horrible with their massive vert recoil."
rbstewart7263,I'm actually excited to come back either this or next wipe now. ðŸ˜Š
LoneCentaur95,Wait until you try an M4 that has good vertical. You can get it down to 22-33 pretty easily.
DarthWeenus,Whats the update? Mine doesnt say any updates? Mine is 0.13.0.121531
Stelio_Kontos-13,"A noob here! If you use a weapon at the shooting range, does it consume ammo from the stash?
Thanks for the help!"
TheOrangeTickler,"Finally, shooting my 9mm doesn't make my PMC feel like he's a 9 year old with polio trying to one-hand an AK."
Sparkando,Bro I'm gonna cry the gun fights finna be so good now ðŸ˜­
xanosta,"New player here! 

I tested some basic guns like the AK-102 and the AKS-74U, and they still jump like crazy. Maybe a bit less than before, but they're still not even close to what is showcased in the OP video.

 I hope this change doesn't end up being another disadvantage for new players who don't have access to better guns or advanced modding."
Piepo1994,*\*Insert laser beam complain*
y_not_right,"I hope people are happy, they bitched so much we have lasers again"
SovietGuyFromGulag,im crying from joy. Fights are going to be enjoyable  and skill-based again.
bondbuyingbandosboi,"Wonder what that 18 vert M4 is like rn, I'm waiting for the audio fixes, someone else can test it"
Ukraine718,Im pretty sure the changes are gonna implemented tomorrow at 6 with a new patch. I didnt see any updates in my launcher today
TrigPiggy,"The mp7 is by far my favorite late wipe smg.  Perfect for reserve, I usually go UMP-P90-MPZ for smg.

For assault AK74-105,AKM-M4-HK-RD704/Mutant.

But my absolute favorite gun is the SR 25.

I pretty much single-handedly took out a 5 man at dome on reserve with an SR 25.  My trick is I use a scope on top and a canted reflex.  I captured video, start at 3:20 for the action, my first 5 man wipe!

https://youtu.be/yNbx2Ewdb7E"
nsfw_vs_sfw,"Awh man, this is what I was afraid of, the age of laserbeaming is apon us again gentlemen. Godspeed"
JustSeraph,"This is ridiculously lowâ€¦ shooting full Auto on that distance with a machine pistol is just wrong. Hope the chads are happy with the changes, cause for casuals this is a death sentence"
SUNTZU_JoJo,"And we are back to no recoil meta.

For the record I never asked or wanted these changes.

Oh well, gonna be that much easier to kill y'all.

[Downvotes don't mean shit for vet that has seen y'all come and go...y'all will be gone soon anyways]"
Edizzleshizzle,"Watch the very start and very end of each spray.  See how they end significantly lower than where they started?  Looks awfully a lot like OP is pulling their mouse down.

Not sure what his agenda is, but probably best to move on and disregard."
Chaos744,Level 40 gonna be even more OP with their fancy guns and bullets. Good grief.
YayFloydo,Yessss
litaoyuan,"Check mk16, itâ€™s like laserbeam"
ImmaKillah,Wait.. is this update for all guns or..?
Sulubezi,I'm excited to test recoil changes out when I get home!
Complete-Sympathy485,Was recoil always this low or did they reduced it even more
Raser43,u/savevideobot
Wegehead,Recoil update???? Praise Jesus and Trey
Key_Presentation1763,HOLY SHIT I CAN ACTUALLY PLAY THE MOTHAFUCKIN GAME NOW
Feuershark,I think this looks like the best middle ground between the laserbeams and the absurd recoil
HaZarD_SFD,"You have completed the ""For Science"" testing of the day.  Thank you for your service."
HaidenFR,"we are doing stealth infiltration brother... we need to move quietl...  


BAHTAHBEUTEUTAH !"
rinkydinkis,holy shit im playing again
marcelsins,Damn that gave me flashbacks of the earlier days
Puritania95,Whatâ€™s the fal like?
burt95,"Lol I know a lot of people are happy about the recoil change but as someone who sucks with or without good recoil, this seems like bad news for me lmao"
YakovAU,"oh joy, TTK was already too low with these weapons."
Ttrip66,THANK YOU NIKITA
attenzionee,"Damn, when CoD got better spraypatterns than Tarkov. What a time to be alive :D"
Noodle_Daddy,Iâ€™m gonna bust.
iSaltyParchment,"Idk bro, all theyâ€™re doing is changing numbers. They need to fix the actual recoil system itself"
Poonamoon,holy shit they did it
Professional-Tip4008,300 blackout is still TERRIBLE
addison-teach,Is this shooting range 1 still? Upgraded all 3 at once and definitely looks different now haha
JoshMushy,The update/changes are tomorrow not today check twitter
CeistDeuce,About fuckin time
fenikz13,"looks so much more realistic, haven't played yet but your head not being held on by a twizzler is really showing now"
wus_krakn,lord have mercy ðŸ˜”
evilomerta,OP is crouched and pulling down. Keep that in mind. Only good players will actually lazerbeam and the gun builds wonâ€™t be cheap. Iâ€™m excited to kill all the noobs building out streamer guns thinking itâ€™ll be like their ump. Itâ€™ll be nice looting a gun off someone that isnâ€™t worth 40k roubles to the vendor lol
Seffi_IV,the patch for it is out already? i didnt see an update or anything
ADaminelli,"Escape from Tarkov is New COD? This new recoil is not real!!!!!! Rollback this path e save the game, not turn one more FPS equals COD!!!!!"
JebstoneBoppman,and unsurprisingly the dweeb ass nerds that hate to play this game are still whining about something in this thread!
swafromsteam,"Mp7 was so good before, now itâ€™s even better!"
TrueRasmus,Everybody excited abt the mp7/m4 but have yall tried the vss/as val? Their recoil is still extremely unrealistic
jsylvis,"The M4 still jumps during the spray but it's minute of man and your camera isn't searching for the moon.

It is... acceptable."
Express_Aspect4465,"Bro, use the same scopes...."
FoxLP11,45 vector is even more insane
-Stahl,How is your M4 recoil that decent? I'm using a holographic with 51 vert on my M4 and it jumps like crazy then somehow shoots below where my actual sight is for the entire mag.
SadFaceCabbageMan,LETS GOOO
TomochanDon,As it should be
realreinjurings,"Honest to God, I think this little update may have just brought me back into the game"
ArvesuEmpire,"Everyone raving about the new recoil, but let's be brutally honest here - in a weeks time, the posts on Reddit will shift to ""Tarkov is too easy now"" or ""Game sucks - extract camping made easier by recoil reduc"" or something along those lines. 

I have a suspicion BSG is going to end up reverting the recoil and the community is gonna have the biggest sht storm. All I can say is that it's BSGs game - they can do whatever they want to it. I play with this mentality and learn to adapt with every wipe. 

Recoil  for auto sucked this wipe? Well that was a good reason for me to get better at semi-auto (currently playing with adar only). 

If you find this comment to be negative, sucks but it's true lol. Having played since 2016 and played almost every wipe, I swear I've seen the same shit happen everytime BSG makes an update based on the community crying ðŸ˜‚. Don't believe it? Just give a week or two and you'll start to see posts complaining how the game is too easy now."
HalfFishLips,Omg reasonable recoil. I might consider playing again.
2giga2dweebish,"Good to see that 4.6chads win again.

Based name btw, I love my Shiny Rayquaza"
w00fx3,I was doing the silenced M4A1 quest on Shoreline and got into two battles with players and won them both because my gun wasn't pointing into the clouds after the first bullet. It felt great! It was like playing a first person shooter rather than being punched in the dick.
2ARM2,M4'S ARE BACK BABYYYY WHOOOOOOOO
Appropriate-Star-787,too bad i quit the game
resfan,"Wow, intermediate caliber rifles are controllable?!
Fuckin wild"
DocileEmu,"What's the point of this? The whole point of skills was to develop your PMC. They've just basically given everyone max recoil control.
Guns have recoil, maybe not as much recoil as what some guns had before the patch but isn't that part of the fun? The more you play the more your PMC's skill would develop, the less recoil you would have. Now I know that's not realistic but it's a game. 
Seeing and feeling progression feels good (at least for me) in a game. Gives you a sense of achievement.
I am not by any means saying that what we had before was good by any stretch. However a change in the speed of progression in the skills might of been a better alternative to the ""problem"" than just turning certain guns into laser beams.

This is Tarkov after all, it's not meant to be easy. BSG want the game to be hard but rewarding (hence skills - the game getting more forgiving as you continue to play).

I understand my opinion might be an unpopular one but I just don't believe this is the right way to go about it.

Open to people's other points of views"
BrodyCanuck,Time to delete the game. BSG is giving in to passive aggressive man children on YouTube that state their opinion as a fact...the beginning of the end has started. Just wait and see how many big cry baby videos and posts get posted now expecting BSG to listen and change the game in their favor to better suit their playstyle. I'm done
BucDan,"Time for the drum mag m4 meta for laser beams. All they had to do was reduce horizontal recoil a bit, but now this recoil is stupid. 

Game is going back to call of duty style ðŸ˜‚"
No-Phase2131,Rediculous
MAYMAX001,So back to laserbeam (ish) ?
CanadianBear67,Ahhh yes this reminds me when labs first came out and everyone was playing call of duty. This is gonna be great. Can't wait for people too bitch again about the recoil and Lazer beams in a couple months.
