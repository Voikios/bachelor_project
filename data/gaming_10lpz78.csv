ERRORMONSTER,Of all the money that e'er I had..[.](https://youtu.be/Y2RQ8YkqeEU)
Serevas,Still my favorite one to date. Spent hours just raiding ships in open water with no goal in mind.
Jacyle,"I literally downloaded this yesterday for $9 on ps4! I googled ""top assassin Creed"" and this was consistently the top game.

Edit: having hit 500 up votes and reading through everyone's comments, I've never been more stoked to play a game!!!"
reallyoldgreg,"Assassin's Creed II, my favorite game of the series, was released 14 years ago. Crazy how time flies."
Valkyrie08,"The scene where Anne sings Parting Glass and Ed meets his daughter made me cry like a little bitch. This game had so much soul put into it, man."
D1xonC1der,My favorite Assassin's Creed
Spram2,"We've been measuring time by advances in video game technology, that's the problem.

The change from the average 1990 game to the average 2000 game was huge. Today, 10 years ago is the same thing but with lower resolution."
YoungJack23,"*inhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaale*

WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE DRUNKEN SAILOR?!"
WolfPaw_90,That's all? Seems older.
poppenhouse,no longer a brisk young sailor
Am2TekkyG,One of the best assassins creed games honestly
AtticusCelestial,Black flag is my favorite AC game.
Zeminek,"No worries, they are working on skull and bones since then"
Mindbender444,Yo ho ho holy shit!
Dreaming_Dreams,actually it only released 9 years and 3 months ago ü§ì
abhikun,And then you realize its still installed in your pc.
Nail_Biterr,"Black Flag was the only AC game I ever played.  I loved it, and got a 100% completion on it.  

I went out and bought all the other AC games, and well.... just didn't like them.  I haven't gone back to the series since.  I like to remember the series as a 1-off game, that (to me) was perfect."
Zealousideal-Beat784,"I cannot emphasize how fucking amazing this game is. Even if there were no missions, no story or anything, if you could just sail and sing shanties I would still play the hell out of it"
BlackNinjaDw,Worst is knowing you got it on releaseüíÄüòî
DanFarrell98,Almost
Yucares,It feels more like 15.
SpecialSurprise69,Could've went all day without having this realization. Thanks for the reminder I'm getting older lol
Slayer-of-Ares,"My favourite after II, the sea shanties always got me singing at the top of my lungs."
AllisonJolicoeur,The only Assassin Creed I played
Firehardt_cc,"what's crazy is the amount of assassins creed they published in these 10 year, i can't even name them all"
GhostMug,"Me: 10 years isn't even that long ago. 

Also me: Oh, damn."
TemplaerDude,Only assassin's Creed (and one of the few games) I've 100% completed. I dunno what it was about that damn game but I enjoyed every second of it.
Grand-Professor-9739,"I said years back that someone should have made a naval pirate game. You start off as a scutty kid in Whitechapel or as an officer boy. The scope is endless. On whaler or on a navy vessel maybe.

You work your way up. Learn navigation, become a sailor.
No swinging the lead. You have endless choices to how your career progresses in the ultimate era of change. You could go into piracy and slavery. Riding the trade winds or maybe you could sail for the crown. Resplendent in your authority. Fighting piracy. 


It's the greatest time in Western civilization for change and the telling of legends. What side would you choose?

If 'they' could get this game right. The story and the mechanics  Holdmyfuckingbeer."
erpstephie,"So, how's that 40K looking? Got grandkids already? Is your back doing okay? How about the knees? What's your retirement plans?"
redlund1993,Still my personal favorite. That ending scene gets me everytime.
DeltaJayHawk,Black flag and Rouge are the best games
AnneMarrynet,Damn ü•≤ honestly my favorite part... Somehow I've enjoyed Edwards story the most... Even cried when some characters died üòÖ
Vellichxrr24,Damn... Thanks for the age check. Ive literally done NOTHING in the past 10 yrs since this game was released and now it will always remind me of that LMAOO
Dickpuncher_Dan,10? I thought it was 15 years ago.
Nova01698,I still have the game
1984AD,It‚Äôs just so good.
Andxel,That's not true! That's impossible!
Spokker,It was the last time I truly loved an Assassin's Creed game. Played the shit out of it on Xbox 360 and then again on PS4.
MooseNo6155,Genuinely the best assassins creed game
bsnimunf,Assassin's creed games were ahead of their time in so many ways but I just didn't  enjoy playing them. Black flag was the exception.
valtro05,It still holds up today. My favorite assassin's creed
aogiritree69,Literally just roll out a franchise using black flag formula. Easy ass money. There‚Äôs only a few quality pirate games
stash3630,Best Assassin‚Äôs Creed by a nautical mile
Flaky-Fellatio,Best AC imo. I wish they would create a game that is just a more fleshed out version of the ship fighting aspect. That was so much fun.
SamuraiReputable,Take me back.
Dawn_Finder,"This one of, if not the best game I‚Äôve ever played"
SonofNyx,Member when Ubisoft made good games. I member
Str8kush,Still my fave AC
Sikisan333,and its still the best of all the series!!!!!
Low-Concentrate2162,"Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been this long, Black Flag was the last AC title I actually bothered playing to the end. The naval battles, the fishing mechanics, the sea shanties. I‚Äôm sure a lot of people disliked some of these new additions but for me it was all so much fun. Brings good memories from when I actually enjoyed beating video games and it didn‚Äôt feel like a big chore."
Appliedretine,Time flies too fast
defusted,And it's been down hill ever since
Awkward-Yak-9033,Well no worries cuz skull and bones might get released one day. I mean it would but you can pretend
GoodbyeSHFs,"Just bought Skyrim for my kids on their new switch last night, I know what you mean."
whoiskjl,I feel like was 10 years ago like 10 years ago
Aka-Shinen,Shut up I will cry
Kid-Nesta,"‚ÄúIn a world without gold, we could have been heros‚Äù"
Derpman2099,"i REALLY want a remaster of black flag. it is still, to this day, one of the graphically best looking games ever made imo."
OHCAPTAlNMYCAPTAlN,Decided to buy it today based on the 10 years posts. I'm hoping to become a fully fledged bad-ass pirate and own the seas. I'd be more than happy to forego missions to just be a pirate raiding other ships. Is that possible?
alu_,Such a great game. Let's drink and sing shanty songs
Blackdiamond180,Just finished another play through of this about 2 weeks ago. Still one of my favorites.
Dranzer009,Skull and bones has been in development for that long?
Wheatception,"Got it for free with my first graphics card. Damn, my first build was 10 years ago üò≥"
KingKJ,The only game to make me cry. So good
schoolisuncool,"Wow, so my first Xbox one was bought 10 years ago then, because I got the black flag bundle. Waited outside for GameStop for 2 hours to get it. Back when people physically went places for events like that. Good times!"
Miguel91mm,Best one
monkeykins,"I can't platinum because it has some online component. Other than that it is an incredibly fun game, the first one of AC i started with and it set sort of an impossibly high bar for the others."
spacebraine,One of my absolute favourite games.
BurnerOnlyForPorn,"I DREEEEEAMED A DREEEEEEEEEEEEEEAM, THE OOOOOTHER NIIIIIIIIGHT‚Ä¶.."
aggel-04,Ahh yes one of the last good assassin's creed
Folkon_sama,"How sad, that Ubisoft decided not to make any new AC after Black Flag. Oh well, at least they ended the series on the high note."
Ghostbuster_119,And skull and bones isn't gonna be the spiritual successor we were hoping for...
AlternativeAd495,"Still one of the best games ever, hands down!  The fact that we still play it 10 years later"
Scoob_,Do people really love the ship combat that much? It was sail up within range of another boat and circle around while firing your cannons. I liked the legendary boat fights in the corners of the maps but god damn the sailing gets its dick sucked so hard on this subreddit.
Sargediamond,"Great pirate Game. Bad everything else IMO. Combat, story, missions...all the traditional assassins creed stuff just feels terrible. I also really did not like Edward, at basically any point in the story."
Charming_Card_1465,*snoring*
ThreeDog2016,"I lost interestin these games when they went no where with Desmonds story and got rid of the modern day protagonist and Nolan North. 

Black Flag felt empty compared to the previous games and I never finished it"
Infinite_Tac0,"Aw yes black flag, the beginning of the end for assassins creed, where the focus was no longer on being an assassin but a pirate that has to sail a boat everywhere. Zzzz"
Lt_Wait4it_Dan,"One of the worst Assassins Creed game ever made imo, you spend 75% of the game on a motion sickness inducing boat and then the other %25 of the game is exploring all the uninteresting tiny islands to grind for gear. Will never understand the love for this game."
Zaku41k,Just to remind all other oldies AC used to mean Armored Core.
OrionMr770,Same thing with me and rayman legends
101stAirborneSkill,I wonder if they'll do a 4k 60fps remaster for its anniversary
universalrifle,I just finished this the other day after I got the Aztec armor. I think they quit having the white whale events though so you might have to buy those skins for the outfit
Qbeck,are there any nice mods for this game that people recommend?
Alpal12,Just started another playthough. I hope skull and bones is like BF but woth more ships and upgrades.
PossiblySamHyde,Test before investment
assblastin00,"This was the first assassins creed game i played. I enjoyed it even though it was a little repetitive. Then i played the london one for a little bit and then the egyptian one and realized the games are almost all exactly the same, just with different skins. Wont ever be getting another game in the series."
dance_rattle_shake,only 10? This is the first time a meme like this has backfired on me.
barkelson69,‚Äú OH WHERE AM I TO GO OH WHERE WHERE AM I TO GO‚Äù OH HEY HEY HEY HIIGH HOOO‚Äù
FabulouslyFrantic,"It's been 10 years since I worked on this?!

I TESTED this thing! I... I need a sabbatical."
XD_002,Meanwhile im only just now getting into it cuz of the Switch port
StayAWhile-AndListen,I still play it from time to time just for that soundtrack
ttgx1000,And the original was 15 years ago.
pakarne,If you miss this game (like I do) it's on Playstation plus for free and the multi-player is still live and booming
dandroid126,"Not quite 10 years yet. It came out like 2 weeks apart after my niece was born, and she's only 9. In October it will be 10 years."
zugzug_workwork,"Lord of the Rings: Return of the King released 20 years ago.  

We're closer to 2040 than 2000."
J-Dabbleyou,"I‚Äôve been gaming since I was very young and this is an all time favorite game. I wish I could replay it a thousand more times, but unfortunately it‚Äôs a 10 year old game and is starting to feel like one. I can only pray they make a second one and keep the spirit of the game."
Brynanimous,Bro drunk
MediaNatural7819,Should I go back and play this? Or any other older AC games for that matter that will still hold up. I never played them so maybe it'll be a good blast from the past.
orangepalm,I'd give sid miers pirates the number 2 slot for best pirate games. That one came out in like 05. Why aren't they making more pirate games?
Dr__Drew,Feels like redditors are confused with how time works
Ebolatastic,It's even more depressing if you contrast it against the original AC and realize where the franchise went after part 1.
SonXal,And it‚Äôs still my favourite of the series
myzon26,"And it still runs like dogwater on PC.
:("
K_Roc_Killz,I played this game just so I can name my character Captain Black Sparrow
THE_GR8_MIKE,"Me realizing I bought it on the Xbox store and never once installed it. I still own it, too."
Tahumatu2010,Really? Wow
BHRx,"Damn and I haven't even unboxed it, still."
MmmPeopleBacon,"I refused to play after Assassin's Creed 3. Was so fucking boring and pointless, honestly not even sure I finished it"
mimi2147,Ayo that's crazy I remember playing that game when it came out üò™
er_meglio,Lol
mcdougall57,We also got the last Rayman. Sad times.
WhenIDecide,"I replayed this recently, it has Ubisoft bloat but the story holds up shocking well"
a953659,Best one too
Rcebanks,What kind of post title is this..
ItWorkedLastTime,I absolutely loved that I could play the trading minigame using my phone. I could send of my trading ships and then check on them using the mobile app a few hours later without logging into the game.
SofiaAsllani,"I'm still gaming with my i7-2600k CPU, which is 12 years old now..."
Waterfallsofpity,"First game I played on my first ever Playstation, was pretty amazing back then.  Loved the ship warfare and sailing the ship for that matter."
ARschoolAK1,Theres no fucking way
pivor,I still remember trailer with Black beard like it was yesterday
Skyrider_Epsilon,"Don't judge me, the campaign was awesome, but i loved the multiplayer. Being chased by someone but not knowing who it is in the middle of dozens of bots... scary feeling."
nothingforever0,And still doesn‚Äôt run at 60fps on current gen hardware
Don_Pacifico,And it‚Äôs been downhill every game since.
bigfeetsmallpp,"Or you could instead be happy and remember how nice it was to play, for me it will always be one of the best games I've played"
PrezMoocow,"It still holds up, go sail the seas!"
_VoRteX_PL,u/Szynmurai
Tokenvoice,"Hell, the weird part for me is that it was only ten years ago, I thought it was a lot longer."
Mexicutioner82,Woah just starting this today
SirNanashi,Please stop. I'm too young for a midlife crisis.
Elith2,"For me, this was the peak of the AC series, possibly down to an unknown love I had for all things pirate. Really should go back and replay that."
Petorian343,"Lowlands, LOWLANDS AWAAAYYY"
RoqueNE,"Down to Trinidad to see Sally Brown, Boys!"
Kryptosis,I just put it on my steam deck. It‚Äôs still amazing and better than plenty of modern games
gameandyoufriends,That recently eh?
readit_later,The best of them
Hollowsong,"Get used to it. Getting old sucks.

The bakery I used to order cupcakes from closed down 14 years ago... still feels like I ordered from them a few months ago."
ShardOfLuck,"Oh man, this game is so cranky, but I dont think I'll love a ge more than this one. I've gone so far as to complete it 100% and it was such a chore but I had to do it for this gem."
CraftyKuko,Yeah... I learned that today as well when I went to check how much it is üò≠üòÇ
CaptainPrower,"IT'S ALL FOR ME GROG, ME JOLLY JOLLY GROG"
,It's been all downhill from there
SwampOfDownvotes,"Why do people get so sad that time passes? Why does it matter if a game came out yesterday or 5/10/20 years ago? If the game is good then that doesn't matter, just go play it."
MorseCodeMike,Assassins creeds zenith
ThanklessTask,"Fond memories of that game.

I got it a few years back and played it over Xmas. My eldest joined me, she'd do the sailing and exploring and look away as I did the assassin stuff.

I'd give a lot to go back to that magic time."
KrispyKremeDiet20,"More like ""me realizing we live in a simulation and nothing matters"""
Few_In-between,Still playing it today though ü§£ü§£
BigEnd3,Good Game.
StatisticianUnited17,That game was superb
TraditionalMood277,"What, I dare ask, to you suppose we do with, I propose, a drunken sailor?"
HiddeHandel,Still wierd that skull and bones isn't like a full game yet they already had the ship mechanism down 10 years ago
TheInfamousDingleB,Anyone else just run for as long as possible in that bitch
SmashingEmeraldz,And I still can‚Äôt get a locked 60fps on PC cause that port was so bad.
BlackSunlight7,NOW YOU‚ÄôRE READY TO SAIL FOR THE HORN
TheRolyns,What is the hot take on Origins? I have tried to re-play it a few times and it feels like a slog. Give it a chance?
Abject_Drawing7923,That was my childhood
kingbuttfucker05,How do you drink?
GodZillaBlazinDong99,Hey!! Thats exactly when my dad left!!
Commercial-Donkey-10,"Best one, for sure."
Mkzo242,Uhhhh fuck i guess so I got PS4 opening day at gamestop and paid a homeless guy to wait in line for me...I was ...yup 23 for sure..damn you linear time illusion
John_Bruklin,Oh shit I played it when I was 8 then
aymnico,Dude I'm still reminiscing of dragon age origin
throwawaycgoncalves,The best one for a long shot.
Gooberman8675,Bully down in Shinbone Al
Helplmchoking,"I hate the constant pumping out of remasters/remakes/reboots for no artistic reasons, just easy money.

But if Ubi wants to redo this one, I'm down. Doesn't work on an ultrawide (no big deal, they didn't exist then and I can split the screen) but the framerate cap, lack of options and that 2010 era retina-searing bloom makes it a bloody tough game to go back and replay.
Plus it might spare us another one of their 400 hour long in-game purchase grindfests"
Perfect_Reading4292,Wow I was just thinking about this today too
felplanhalva,"I rarely play games but for some reason I played Black Flag, and the scenery, story, characters, I consider it one of the greatest games I‚Äôve ever played, and I wish it wouldn‚Äôt end."
Alternative_Gold_993,"Black Flag deserves a remake. Too bad Ubisoft is just using a cookie cutter for all their games, now."
myguydied,"Welp there's how many of us still playing Skyrim why the hell not Black Flag

You know what I might even keep this in mind after my current playthrough"
Cr0n_J0belder,Still one of my favorites.  The sea shanties made it for me.
BlackberryOk965,"take my up doot, its was so much fun on the ps3 yall"
Hamdilou,Got it for christmas when it came out still feels like yesterday
Nufez42,Stop‚Ä¶ it came out last year *sniffles*
Katalyst81,"wait... that game I got for $5. played til I could sail, got rocked by the first ship that was near me so I closed the game and deleted it?   oh was it good? then why was an elite target in my way? Origins was better..."
Curious_Ad_9954,"Like how its been the longest time span without any GTA, of all the GTA games, 5 to 6 obviously!
Makes one feel older!"
Texas-Ranger95,Edward kenway my brother
satin360,I think this was the second or third game I ever played on the PS4. Completely blew me away. One of my all time favorites. Loved everything about it. I was so sad after finishing it because it was done. It was my first ever ac game too. Bought unity when it came out because black flag left such an impression on me. This game was just something else.
Nebuerdex,Now this is a game that would actually be sick remastered
Onde_Bent,The best AC-game in the last 10 years
harem_king69,"Not really, it came out at the end of the year like every other AC, so there's still 10 months left until the 10th year. ü§ì"
Legendary-12,So much time passed
superjames74,Thank you so much for making me feel old .However I still think that‚Äôs the best assassins creed game.
fakeappuser,rogue remastered was really same as black flag. They drowned the story tho
wolt_wolfy,"Weird that it does till holds up today, but im not complaining"
danlawl,Too bad AC2 is the best in the series by a country mile.
wetlettuce42,Awsome game really
grrliz,Feels longer
Jakeyboah13,My favourite assassins creed. Brotherhood and origins come close but this is still such a masterpiece
No_Winner_7456,Best Ac game still till this day
BreachlightRiseUp,"One of my favorite games, maybe not top 5 but I remember that being one of the first games I played on the ps4 after upgrading from a ps3. The graphics just seemed so amazing"
hungrilyexcitable263,It's now sitting on my steam deck. It's still incredible and superior than many contemporary games.
deafening_mainfra472,"I detest how often remakes, reboots, and remasters are produced for no creative or artistic motive other than to earn quick cash."
BurdensomeRecogni338,"Wow, I was just considering this today."
costly_infiltrati581,"There are still some of us playing Skyrim, so why the heck not Black Flag?"
Bleklteg,just go play it again you muppet
Sethazora,Dont worry they release a new version every year for you to pay
Rathal_OS,"The fact that people prefer Black Flag's little to no good gameplay, to AC3's maps and story, is beyond me"
