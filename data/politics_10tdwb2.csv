was_and_wasnt,"Republican Chairman of the committee Michael Mccaul:

Cairo has flights into JFK, and they're going to open another one at Dulles... As long as we have flights coming directly to the United States, I think it's putting Americans at risk.

Civilian Egyptian airlines threaten the US? And Omar is getting kicked off the committee?"
HotConversation4355,Pointless .You can‚Äôt shame people who have no shame.
was_and_wasnt,"Chairman of the committee Michael Mccaul:

One of the chapters outlined in my book talks about the Iranian influence with Venezuela, these terror flights that go back and forth that we don't manifests on, and then nuclear material smuggled across our unsecure southwest border from Mexico into the United States.

Iranian and Venezuelan 'terror flights' that will bring nuclear material over our southern border?  Conspiracy much?  And Omar is the one getting kicked off the committee?"
Bibble4Shitz,Well I‚Äôm sure the Republicans will change course now that we‚Äôve called them out. I mean it‚Äôs not like they are callous bigots that feel no shame. Ohhhh wait‚Ä¶
Bearbarn,"The dems on every committee should play recordings of the GOP making their crazy comments. 

They need to step up and call them out."
RPtheFP,"Ah the tried, true, and effective tactic of hypocrisy shaming against the GOP. It‚Äôll work this time."
22DC,"I‚Äôm a bit disappointed in the coverage of this, especially in the political podcasts.  I feel there is not enough emphasis on the fact that MTG and Gosar got kicked off their committees because they literally endorsed violence against members of the DNC caucus.  

That is light years away from saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about the benjamins‚Äù suggesting that Israel is trying to impact American politics with money.  The difference becomes even more stark when you see that Israel absolutely tries to impact American politics with money.

Democrats will brush some lint off your shoulder followed by Republicans punching you in the face and declaring: ‚ÄúWhat?  We both are just touching you‚Ä¶‚Äù. The difference in degree makes it a difference in kind and its all in bad faith."
ZealousWolverine,Republicans are the abusive father. Democrats are the mom who always cries but doesn't do anything to protect her kids. Guess who we are.
dmanjrxx,They gave Santos a committee and then let him walk away on his own while also giving Green and Gosar  committee assignments. This GOP can care less about being  seen as blatant hypocrites. Power and their agenda are more important
evasivegenius,How many 'democratic women of color' get to stay on their committees?
sortofpresent,"Conservative Democrats spent the last 3 years punching down on Ilhan for cheap points. Now that she is in actual danger, they want to pretend to be in solidarity with her. 

They should examine their own past behavior and plan to do better before they can have an actual shot a defeating this nationalism we see on the GOP side."
ominousgraycat,"I wasn't even sure what her ""anti-Semitic"" remarks were. I just looked them up and it's truly pathetic to even frame them as being crazy anti-semitic. When asked about why so many were opposing her rights to speak out against Israel, she said that other politicians getting money for supporting Israel was the reason.

People say crap like that all the time about other countries and no one says it's racist, but someone said it's anti-semitic because she's talking about ""Jews running the world through money"". I don't think she said anything racist. I don't think she was saying that the Jews are some enormous bloc who all work together to control the world through money, but she was saying that there may be certain people in Israel bankrolling certain US politicians. I think it is dangerous to say that someone cannot say that could be the case.

I am against saying that all Jewish people in the world have together formed a shadowy world government that controls everything. However, it is important that we maintain the right to criticize the Israeli government, and we certainly should be able to criticize certain politicians in the Israeli government."
KKYBoneAEA,"I‚Äôm confused. 

Why doesn‚Äôt Fetterman, the largest of the members of Congress, not simply eat the others?"
Juviltoidfu,"Absolutely shocking how a party that devised and executed a ""Southern Strategy"" to gain power in the South and fought (succesfully) against the Equal Rights Amendment and designed laws that targeted blacks, immigrants and religions not favored by their party leaders while blocking research and distributing lies about AIDS in the 80's and 90's and used smear campaigns, some successful, some not, against major Democrat politicians since the 1980's while trying to impose their religious and economic philosophies on people aren't the kind of people you can trust to be either honest or fair."
AFRN,"I am compelled to realize that the majority party can remove anyone from committee; then recall that Dems allowed Boebert, Gaetz, and Jordan sit on committees when they were in charge."
kazneus,they literally elected her to the committee just to make a show of kicking her off ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Erinalope,"Yes, they‚Äôre hypocrites. We know that and they know that, decrying doesn‚Äôt help. So pointless. No one is getting ‚Äúowned‚Äù or nothing."
thatdopecollegekid,This is AIPAC pulling the strings. These republicans are being lobbied to make these decisions from AIPAC. Let‚Äôs be real
JDeau93,Hypocrisy isn‚Äôt a Republican occasional sin. It‚Äôs their business model.
hoopcloset,Antlions and combine. It's popcorn time.
StrangerAtaru,"It's just about ""tit for tat"" nonsense and ""the base"".  It has nothing to do with security or what's right for America, it's just ""oh, they kicked MTG off committees, we need to when we're in power again"".  

I say we should take note, but the other side doesn't care one bit and keeps voting for them."
Murdercorn,"Attacking a Republican for hypocrisy is like attacking the Human Torch for being on fire. He knows he's on fire. He's on fire because it lets him accomplish his goals and makes it easier to hurt the people he thinks are his enemies.

The entire Republican belief system is structured around causing the most suffering to the most people, and the rest of their ideology is completely fluid in order to accomplish that goal.

So they want states‚Äô rights when it would let them repeal voter protections for black people, but they are very opposed to states‚Äô rights when a state wants to mandate vaccinations.

Being in a photo with Epstein is damning proof that you lead a secret life as a rapist of children if you're a Democrat, but being in a photo with Epstein is proof that you're working tirelessly to protect children if you're a Republican.

They‚Äôre against government spending when a Democrat tries to fix bridges, or provide healthcare, but they're very much for government spending when a Republican wants to spend billions to dump a bunch of useless shit in the desert and imprison a bunch of brown children.

It's not about states‚Äô rights, or children, or government spending. It's about maximizing the pain caused to the maximum number of people. Repairing roads and bridges doesn't cause enough suffering so they're against it. Prosecuting Republicans who rape would get in the way of their policy agenda of stripping women's bodily autonomy, so they're against it. Confirming a right-wing Supreme Court justice in the last year of a Presidential term would help them undo civil rights protections, so they‚Äôll do exactly what they said should be absolutely illegal four years earlier in order to do that.

Don't listen to what they claim to believe in, because that will be contradicted by what they're going to claim to believe in a week from now and it already conflicts with what they claimed to believe in the very core of their being a year ago. Look at what they actually support and why. It's always the position that ensures the most pain, death, and misery for the most people.

It's the *only* thing they truly believe."
IrritableGourmet,"They didn't lie. They ousted her because of antisemitism. Namely: She wasn't antisemitic. I mean, she never even headlined at a neo-Nazi rally! /s"
Gaflinnigus_Flumming,They had to oust the alleged anti-semite to make room for the confirmed anti-semite.
spacebetween22,Republicans think hypocrisy is a good thing soooo
boulder_holder_,Fuckin do something about it. Taking the high road got everyone here.
Pete_D_301,"It's very rich coming from them. Rep. Omar was removed from her committee because of ""antisemitism."" Says the political party that always caters to antisemitic white nationalists. Just remember, hypocrisy is one of many features of today's GOP, not a bug."
Olderscout77,No hypocrisy here. Just more Republican Racism.
Chadwich,Decry hypocrisy? They do not and have never cared about looking like hypocrites.
SatanCarpet,"Didn‚Äôt like, over a hundred democracts vote for that dumbass oppose socialism bill? We are not dealing with our best people here folks."
Intubater69,Turn about is fair play.
Spring___spring69,Republicans hate minorities. They can't allow non white people to be in any position of power if they have the ability to prevent it.
_Norman_Bates,"What did she say specifically, what were the antisemitic comments?"
sdlover420,Anytime Republicans have a problem with something that Democrats are doing the dems need to read off a list of illegal activities committed from the person whom they're being accused by.
Smrleda,Republicans are so hateful they have lost all perspective. Their hate drives their actions. They no longer have the ability to reason and differentiate.  Republicans are a threat to democracy.
,[deleted]
Friendly-Remote-7199,Only people who hate Ilhan more than republicans are her own people. See how they treated her at Somali music week in her home state of Minnesota.
FiascoBarbie,"It isn‚Äôt hypocrisy this time.  They hate Muslims AND jews AND women and have clearly said that they means justifies the ends in their quest to just have republicans in power at all costs or any cost.

This is exactly who they are

https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-democrats-violence/index.html. Support for executing democrats from nutcase extraordinaire (but elected nonetheless) MTG

McCarthy sold - what ever is called when the person no longer even has a soul - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64194129

This is exactly what their platform was and exactly why they were elected by the people that elected them"
radek4pl,"Democrats booted a republican over an anime meme and now republicans booted a black supremacist and an antisemite from the committee. 

Cry me a river, hypocrites"
rucb_alum,"Fortunately, Republicans - especially Republican officeholders - have had their sense of hypocrisy, shame, and humor surgically reduced. 

The ones from MAGA districts also go for the reduction in patriotism and knowledge of the fundamental principles of democracy."
thisMFER,"Dem leadership still thinks the GOP cares about morals...somewhere.
That's just the excuse they used to remove her.They do not care what we think.I mean they let lying-ass Brazillian drag guy cast a vote to remove her, Dispite their stance on Drag culture.They .Don't .care."
ynnubyzzuf,Hypocrisy is the brand. Stop giving them attention. Fucking idiots.
Ekublai,Interesting that the headline could be ‚ÄúDemocrats cry hypocrisy‚Äù but that would seem like a negative.
DirtWaterAir,Somehow both parties will use this to grift money from people.
DonTreason,No republican that helped to incite the Jan 6 insurrection should be able to be on any committees.
VNM0601,Democrats need to start playing dirty already. They‚Äôre never going to be able to reason with traitorous insurrectionists.
comalicious,"Yeah, like no shit. They‚Äôre hypocrites. They‚Äôve been this for decades."
Realistic_Expert717,GOP is a fckn joke. About 2 more years of this shyt show we have to deal with.
Donald_J_Putin,"The party of ‚ÄúJewish space lasers‚Äù. 

On a side note, anyone notice MTG is trying to rebrand herself as a main line Republican now that she has clout?"
AnimalBren,"Man this thread is infested with both-sider bots

Damn shame"
nfasson,Nothing scarier to a Republican than a brown woman with a little bit of power.
22USD,"She is against Russia sanctions for Ukraine invasion because supposedly she has doesn‚Äôt want Russian people to suffer for the actions of their government

So how come she doesn‚Äôt apply the same logic when she supports BDS against Israel?"
Ennuidownloaddone,"Very poorly written article that shows clear bias by not quoting what Omar said.

‚ÄúWe must have the same level of accountability and justice for all victims of crimes against humanity,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúWe have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban.‚Äù

When Democrats wrote a letter asking her to ""clarify"" her stand, she claimed that they were being islamophobic and anti-black by asking.

I agree with her.  The USA has committed and continues to commit atrocities and the atrocities we commit should be held to the same standard as when others commit them.  However, her stance that just by asking her to clarify means that those asking are islamophobic is ridiculous and makes me trust her judgement less if she's going to hide behind that whenever she's questioned."
F4robo,Why? Lady made anit semtic comments.
new-6reddit9,"I will remember next election how Republicans continue with their hate for women.  Will once again, Vote against ALL Republicans in my ballot!"
TheShereKahn,Both parties ousted her for antisemitism.
,[deleted]
ActuallyFakeBanana,I thought they were removing her for her constant and blatant antisemitism.
rethinkingat59,It was made clear to Democrat leadership that there would be retribution as they more than once selectively removed Republicans from committees. Hypocrisy is acting like the innocent injured party when the promised penalty is delivered.
semenseeker1,This person absolutely hates Jews.  This was the correct decision.
alanbcox,‚ÄúHypocrisy‚Äù is a meaningless word in today‚Äôs GOP.
fathercreatch,"Were all of the Muslims and women of color removed from all committees? Or just this one person, and a few white males?"
Treesaregreen2,It‚Äôs funny how the media was wording this as ‚Äúalleged antisemitic remarks‚Äù when they were clearly and obviously not antisemitic in any way shape or form.
crabbiekins,Never in history have the Democrats ousted someone from a committee for political reasons. https://www.npr.org/2021/02/04/963785609/house-to-vote-on-stripping-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-from-2-key-committees
akajondoe,To be fair Democrats ousted Republican members of Congress  from committee assignments when they were in power. You can't cry when you invented it.
GrowTrees530,Never seen Reddit cry over a congressional committee before. Wonder why.
MonacoBall,Are the democrats not then hypocrites for voting to keep her on the committees?
Gordopolis,"As a liberal and rational person, I'm totally fine with ousting MTG and Ilhan Omar as they both have said extremely problematic things and have had controversy follow them throughout their careers.  

I'm sure there are more qualified people without their baggage."
6ory299e8,"Oh they have DeCrIeD 
...

Wake me up when something meaningful happens."
stclvr53,The weak are scared of the truth and they can't stand to look at themselves in the mirror.
HoosierDev,Okay so how are the democrats responding?  That‚Äôs what I care about.
dadudemon,"""How dare you play the game all of us are always playing! You weren't supposed to do that for some weird and unexplainable reason.""

Okay. 

Alternative title: ""Democrats shocked that Republicans did what Democrats and Republicans always do"""
platinum_toilet,People need to realize the consequences of a GOP house majority.  There could be worse things happen besides Omar getting booted from a committee.
JohnOliverismysexgod,"They don't give a twirly fuck about any perceived antisemitism.  If they did, they'd go after the motes in their own eyes:  djt, mtg, etc.  They don't like her because she's a smart female immigrant with dark skin.  As far as I am concerned, she should be Speaker of the House."
the_real_abraham,"I want to remind people that what makes the ""Nigerian Prince"" emails work is the intentional bad grammar.  The hypocrisy is intentional.  The stupid, misspelled tweets are intentional.  The clown show in the House is intentional.  They have a specific audience.  They are being successful.  They have won the lottery because that's how their base is spending their paychecks.  Just one last thought.  Their religion says it's all supposed to burn to the ground."
ooouroboros,They need to start outright calling these people fascists.
ashigaru_spearman,"Republicans have NEVER cared about being labeled as hypocrites.

The Left needs to up its rhetorical game."
Astro_Astro,The headline be ‚ÄúRacist GOP needs to be stopped‚Äù.
lemartineau,Republicans and hypocrisy kinda go hand in hand
DunningKrugerOnElmSt,Hipocrisy shaming doesn't work in fascists.
4alittleRnR_2057,Way off topic. What does any of this have to do with Republican hypocrisy?
2Ledge_It,"I'm tired of them crying hypocrisy to a media that doesn't care and won't hold republicans to any standards.

Just fucking crush them."
Impressive-Listen-37,"If yours republican there's nothing to illegal ,dirty or i unethacelthat they don't approve of"
bigdon802,Republicans hypocritical? No shit.
Historical-Dot1573,""" In addition to calling out hypocrisy regarding Rep. Taylor Greene, Meeks said Republicans also failed to condemn Rep. Mary Miller for quoting Adolf Hitler in Congressional remarks and Rep. Paul Gosar for ‚Äúinviting a Holocaust denier to the State of the Union.‚Äù "" 

Its wild how under reported this exact line is"
Ivorcomment,"Hypocrisy?

Personally, I think I am owed a badge of honor as I have just been permanently banned from r/conservatives for the third time. Apparently, free speech is something conservatives demand until that free speech contradicts their own views - censorship is then totally permissible!"
willcomplainmightily,She‚Äôs trash
Sheldon121,"Bye bye, Jew ha..ter.  Why she was ever on that committee is a puzzle to me."
1buzer,Boo hoo
AFQpro,If she is going to openly be opposed to US foreign policy she doesnt belong on the committee.
LastVisitorFromEarth,Teethless losers.
Krond,"Hypocrisy is UNACCEPTABLE... when the other side does it.  


Justified and necessary when my side does it.  


   \- Politicians on both sides"
CantStopMeReddit4,Definitely hypocrisy but at the same time she‚Äôs one of the most annoying members of Congress so I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs happening to her
Guyote_,Im sure that will accomplish a lot. Don't the Dems have some socialism to vote against or something instead of crying?
Potential_Case_7680,And the hypocrisy of democrat doing it first.
ResidentAdmirable814,"Omar the racist should be cleaning the toilets at the holocaust memorial, not voting on bills or sitting in committee."
Whole_Willingness_50,"Should have expected it, they did set the precedent. Now let‚Äôs hope everyone grows up."
aidsballs14,I thought redditors opposed whataboutism? Curious it is not opposed in this case.
fifthstreetsaint,"Because Dems are spineless centrists who have zero interest in changing the status quo.

Stop voting for them.

And Republicans, obviously."
daithi08,"Pretty sure I remember hearing about her and Chuck Shewmer, removing republicans and not putting seats to a vote, which has always been done, and removing and appointing people.

Then the republicans said, if this is how you want to play politics, stand by.

Looks like they are making good on their promises.  

Now it is grade yard bullying on both sides and they are crying and whining.

Next election, vote for someone not in either party, send them a message. And when they still get elected, you know it‚Äôs rigged‚Ä¶"
KobeFadeaway248,She has anti American sentiment regularly and represents the USA. She is unfit for her job and should be removed.
Fuzzy_Variation1830,Good riddance. Having antisemites on committees is bad.
Scullyx,"Dems actually did the exact same thing to radicals MTG and Paul Gosar and were warned of the precedent it would set and that Rs would do the same when they were in power.

They did the same to Dem radicals.

Dont set precedent you dont want used against you later

Cant cry now, hypocrite."
naththegrath10,Dem leadership paced the way for this.
kudles,"Committees in congress are a huge sham anyway. Have to pay millions to even have a seat on one. 

Maybe the real reason is she can‚Äôt afford it?"
Birdup711,"The less influence anti semites have, the better."
Legionheir,Oh yes watch how republicans now give two shits what anyone has to say. We‚Äôre doomed if their only opposition is calling out their hypocrisy. I think they‚Äôve made peace with the fact that they themselves are scum and they don‚Äôt give a fuck what you say about it.
Explodedhamster,"Cry all you want... they don't care. Republicans put up and shut up and vote together. Hypocrites, liars, they don't care. They don't care. They don't fucking care. 

But let's go high when they go low and see if that changes something. Fucking pathetic"
,Double standard‚Ä¶ both sides do this all the time to the other sides about removing people from committee..
Lagspresso,"Oh boy. Hypocrisy in politics. What? Am I supposed to be surprised? They're all lying, traitorous shitbags. No well-adjusted person makes it to the grand stage of American politics. Not for the your enemy's side. Not for your side."
PrudentGate3825,I love getting you guys all up and into a frenzy
