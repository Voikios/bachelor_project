ajrwilmot,THE PERSON IS FLOATING IN MIDAIR WHERE YOU CANT FLOAT IN AND PEOPLE ARE RULEBOOK BASHING
DaHedgehog27,Saw a duo with one guy doing this yesterday on labs EU..
Yayo_Mateo,Cheating is rampant at the moment
mtmaiman,OP’s getting a lot of heat in this thread for simply trying to bring further attention to the cheater issue within this game
ReformedLifter,wait till u find out he won't even get banned for an entire wipe pepelaugh
Rezhyn,Seeing multiple cheaters on multiple streams is just crazy. Feels like they didn't update the anti cheat whatsoever this wipe. Usually its clean for a little. Die to at least one blatant one every day myself.

LooMinairy,Checked. Account still active at Lvl 31
ajrwilmot,At the end of the day i couldn’t care less. I’m literally calling out a cheater.
attomsk,Yup hackers are running rampant this wipe.  Seen more hackers getting to 15 than I did getting to 43 last wipe.  Just tonight a grenade spawning hacker killed my 3 man.  Just dropping grenades at our feet wherever we ran to

xxTERMINATOR0xx,"Just ran into a douche called “Laxdon” or some shit like that and he was sniping us from the weather station on Reserve all the way across the map, shooting us through the train carts and at us through walls. Anyways, he finally comes to us at the end of raid and VOIPs “pest control!” and just head eyes us. Literally nothing we can do but report him, fucking dickhead."
DuckyLouu,Ran into one just now on lighthouse.
paulfunyan,"People getting upset at you for pointing out a cheater is so wild. There isn't a .45 round that does less than 60 damage, let alone 35 to one shot a head.

The fact that people are so nonchalant about this shit on the sub is pretty sus tbh there has to be a fair amount of cheaters or RMT losers trying to downplay shit.

Cheaters have gotten more and more bold over the past 3 wipes.. that is a terrible trend. If they aren't afraid of doing shit like this you know that means they aren't frequently getting caught."
saltyclam13345,Reminds me of the scene in Training Day where Ethan Hawke’s character wouldn’t take the money lol
banjosuicide,"How is this even fun for people?

Like a radar cheat is super pathetic but I get some people feel like they need it. Flying around invincible though... There's literally no challenge. Do they get some kind of pleasure out of collecting loot that they don't even need?"
goBerserk_,"This guy clearly isn’t cheating, he just has some elite gaming shoes."
ForgeKid,I’ve heard that the hitbox is just massively misplaced and that you might be able to kill them just can’t see where the hitbox is.
muatdks,"Just said this but I’ll repeat is here, 

Bsg has clearly stopped caring about anything that won’t make the game more appealing (maps, guns, etc) they only thing they’ve been doing for years now is just doing band aid fixes instead of actually taking caring of these game breaking issues for good. No profit incentive in fixing bugs."
NotARealDeveloper,Can't wait for the BSG dick riders to join this post.
Omniwatch,"The name for this cheat feature is call “god mode” it spoof the location of the real players position hence when you shoot them it’s just a dummy body and they don’t die. ( the tell sign is that their looks don’t moved when moving and look like it’s floating.). 


You can use nade or explosive to kill them or use other Chest that has counter for god mod.

GL. And god speed."
coinlockerchild,"you can't damage zenyatta when he ults, how long have you played this game to not know?"
RousseSvelte,"Labs full of cheaters?   
Damn never seen that... BSG still don't care? oof  


Ban wave soon, then discount price of EFT, Nikita need money to fuel the war"
R1se94,you are delisional in my 10 000 playtime i have met a cheater half a time its just skill issue u need to stop blaming cheaters and focus on urself /s
Fayko,"You guys are getting into games to die by hackers? I thought the game was ""Waiting for players..."" wtf is this?"
GarryGirth,they should just like contract like 50 people to go into labs and ban cheaters. Stop relying on battleye. From what ive heard battleeye cant even detect there cheats
Amphibian-Existing,"Can’t have a game like this, that has a cheater problem like this. It’s stupid. 
Such a great concept but cheaters are ruining it"
Dlitosh,Cmon Guyz its in BetA /s
SSHz,"Hmmmmm I don't knoooooow, it might just be desync guys!

I haven't seen any cheaters personally so there are no cheaters in EFT overall.

Git gud

Etc, Etc...

jlebrech,i ran into this cheater on shoreline too
RandomBlokie,"The best thing for this game would be an exodus of players. Players showing enmass that they're not willing to play a game as inconsistent and unstable as this for the seventh year in a row. As the numbers drop, revenue drops, interest dwindles and BSG is forced to act. We've tried to show them our passion, suggestion hasn't worked as we'd like, it seems like the only thing they'd respond to is action.

Unfortunately, we'll never see the day.

Head, eyes. YY_994749______ gg go next."
RDR2LAUNCHSUCKED,"At this point I'm pretty sure BSG produces and releases the cheats themselves. Double the profits baby, fuel that never ending cycle"
Minimum-Impression63,Come on man he's not cheating it's just a bug remember the game is still in beta
LizardKing413,Crazy they're doing drops right now with all their big streamers bitching about hackers every 3 minutes to their biggest audiences of the game for the whole year and they don't even care about hackers
ExecutionerKen,"And a note for people blaming hackers coming from other countries.

No we have plenty of hackers here"
Rizl_,"Stop calling them hackers, they're low life cheaters.."
StellarReality,Wait you mean you guys don't like loading into a game and instantly being head/top of head killed within 15 seconds of match start and no one in sight?
sythalrom,BSG won't do anything to him.
Collusional,Shoot him in his legs!! I didn’t tell you that though…
algumnome,"I died to a guy moving exactly like this yesterday on labs. Searched for him then he was lvl 49, rn 8 hours later he is 51."
Joshohoho,Sad. I like this sub reddit more than the game now.
Dustin_Live,Id say I hope you reported him but I doubt it will do anything.  I've seen hackers around the late 30s already.  They basically charge be because I'm in my 30s running meta guns.  They're pretty blatant.
specwolf82,"Welcome to Tarkov, the cheating problem is getting worse and BSG can't combat it quick enough because of the dog shit engine this game was built on originally, people using radar are literally Un detectable and there's at least one in every raid per AVG. Everytime a hacker gets banned that's $120 in BSGs pocket when they buy another account"
Ghost4530,"The fact that I quit tarkov years ago because of cheaters and people just keep saying they are getting worse like what the hell man. Then we got the bsg Stan’s who will for some reason defend and justify cheaters to no end, probably for their own sake."
CorvusEffect,"That's not a cheater, that's Kars, leader of the Pillar Men."
Minimum-Impression63,The majority of the money that they have made off this game is in the bank. They don't give a shit If you quit playing. They are not reinvesting the money they make into this game. Nothing will ever change with the core  issues this game has. If you love the game you're gonna have to put up with the bugs and the cheaters That has been made crystal clear.
osheareddit,Clearly a skill issue.
Separate-Advance-453,I’d bet that around 35-40% of the player base are utilising cheats
battlestate-what-the,"Comrades. Solution is obvious. We give game brains. So game become smarter than smooth brain cheat user. Game still dumb. Jaeger still count inch for kill with measuring tape in woods. But it smarter than cheater.

—

BSG makes more than enough money $100M+/yr in revenue that they can throw something like $10M on training a neural net to detect normal players.

Just like not hotdog, the neural net finds normal players. It finds not cheaters. The people who are left are the *likely* cheaters (we don't know for sure so actual humans will have to check/review their games).

My proposal is ""simple"", 

   * **Step 1.** Find trusted players at all levels of skill. Most of these people are already known, they're in the Beta testing group. 

   * **Step 2.** Give ~~human sacrifices~~ volunteers colonoscopy. Record all of their keystrokes in game, mouse inputs, loot interactions, methods of killing, flea market trades, spotting a friend, how normal player character moves etc.

   * **Step 3.** Do Step 2 to many thousand people. The sample size needs to be a few thousand to 10k people to capture diversity of play and options. Even get a few peaceniks in there.

   * **Step 4.** Create signature. What is a ""normal"" player? Across skill levels from Timmy's to Sigma Chads — what does a normal player look like?

   * **Step 5.** Rent NASA supercomputer. Train model until it works.

   * **Step 6.** Hit Big Red Button that say Deploy.

Use the neural net to watch players. Identify all of the people who are ""normal"". Remove them from the list.

Everyone left is either some innocent weird person — in this case add them to Step 2 with their permission — or cheater.

What follows next is up to BSG.

One option is that BSG can then add a layer where they check reports of cheating, and other anomalies. And they review these suspects, give them warnings/suspensions and in obvious cases ban them.

At some point, the cheaters will catch on. But the only way out for them would be to replicate normal play styles. Which then means that they aren't heads-eyes-ing people all the time etc.

We will win by forcing cheaters to play like normal players.

Make Tarkov Boring Again.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
Novel-Shame5835,"Not a single cheater in my game. But my secret is I play aki. The mod that makes it offline but feels the same as online with pmc, Bosses, bear and scav. I use profiles so they level the same as me. I can config it to be max 5 lvls higher. So an ai bot can be kind of the same loadout. Then mods with profiles for the ai. A mix or all very good. Or just bad to have funny shootouts. Still some are so good they rush you or are afraid or just run away. Like a player would do. One thing I know tho 100% no cheaters. And its fun because I can play it how I want. Not grindfest cheater infest bs lag town. But simply a cool shooter with looting and still moments of fear because damn these ai profiles are crazy modded. 😁

Ps. No time for grindy games online anyway."
Hendo_AU,"I haven't played the game in over a year but one thing I used to do on labs was spawn in and immediately go hide in one of the bathrooms and wait for like 10 or 15 minutes before coming out to loot.

So many times I would be sitting there alt tabbed not moving and have someone open the door and start chucking nades in at me, fucking bullshit game."
WWDubz,"Give BSG time to fix anything, they’ve only had 7 years"
Swiggityswagity,"A hacker killed me and all my boys (5 total) on woods, he was sniping at us from sniper rock and we were in the bigger USEC camp. Knew it was sniper rock because saw the tracer. Perfect accuracy. It’s bullshit. I just upgraded to EOD and I hardly want to play bc of the cheaters. It’s ridiculous."
PanProjektor,"That was Santa, you loose rep by killing him, gives gifts… nothing to see here"
myironlung6,"THE CHEATERS THE CHEATERS

\*continues to play this dogshit code game despite every single indication BSG does not give one fucking shit about addressing cheating, shitty audio, shitty recoil, or fixing any other mechanic that's been broken for 10 wipes in a row\*"
ReasonableConfusion,Not too sure I understand the title of the post. What does Meta Aladdin mean?
Ok-Life8294,"I have a cheater friend that I watch a lot. What's absolutely insane to me is that every.single.fucking.lobby that he's in has atleast 1 other cheater. I've personally died to more cheaters this wipe than every other wipe combined.

They're on every fucking map besides woods cause... well its woods.

It's a massive infestation. It's the worst I've ever seen it. There are soooooo many cheaters"

Woahboah,God I fucking hope arena has better anti cheat.
Piringochas,Gaming chair too strong
BrotherToby,"Hackers and SKS buffed af.. not to mention rogues on light house, sure I have still a lot to learn about the game (pvp wise) but it’s obvious that the game needs major tuning. Don’t take me wrong tho, I still enjoy the game when it’s “working properly”"
Epicode,BSG should find the other way to make money. Not like this.
qwer4790,He literally launched a physic wave and you died by heartattack damn
olishoplifter,Ran into the same type of cheater on Customs today (NA East). Dude came out of nowhere asking me and my homie if we wanna trade backpacks. Told him I don't want to have anything to do with it and he shot us both in the face lol. Same deal invincible and all.
C0nstant_Regret,"Skill issue, shots 1-5, still in beta"
Interesting-Fan-3331,Had similar floater on factory. He was protecting two naked pmcs at the exit.
Hungry-Bullfrog-7887,What’s the point? They are not only ruining the game for others but for themselves as well. The point of this game is that it’s not easy. But rewarding in the end.
AtlasCarry1,I wish BSG would release figures on how much money they have made off banned accounts vs. legit accounts. I personally feel I have enough content for a long time. I really wish BSG would just focus on reducing the cheating and optimizing the game so that it doesn't take a absolute shit when I launch it and play it.
THE_RECRU1T,How do people get enjoyment out of it
paulmonterro,Yesterday I met a cheater with PPSh on Factory at 2am escorting his poor Timmy. Thank god for lvl4 face shield but other guys were not so lucky. I hope it’s not as bad on shoreline since there are next 50 quests…
ethrelol,"As a new player I died like this a few days ago while hiding in a bush at night time. 

There weren’t any footsteps or players around me that I knew of, then I just hear that same “thud” sound and drop dead from 1 “head, ears” shot. I thought I was like rifle butted or something…"
28022006,the good thing about being a rat is i never have good enough loot to be killed by a cheater

If it's blatant like this or with a video of them saying names and telling to drop key cards we should have a mechanism for submission with proof and banning them...."
huck209,Wait he’s not Chinese?!?!
Screeched,Last night I was on customs and had a guy tracing me behind cover with bullets. We hadn’t come into contact or seen each other before he starred shooting at the wall I was behind - I’m getting like 2- 3 cheaters a night right now. This sucks.
NaNiBy,"Wait, untill more people figure out how to do invisibility glitch 👍   
Played 5 games on shoreline yesterday, got killed by someone doing it 2 times 👍"
Redlinekouki,I used to think hackers weren't to bad... But after 15 raids straight of only dying to a one tap head eyes.... This is bull shit. Especially after having shot someone 6 times in the face with bt 5.45 and them not dropping... It's getting to the point where it's not even worth playing.
DarkThingy69,"Eroktic used to Point this Things Out. 
Well .. you all know the Story.

Mr_Fluxstone,"I am not sure but BattleEye has no Kernel Level Cheat Detection like as example Valorant no?  
Part of me kinda wants that to change but... This type of stuff brings an entire can of worms onto the table and I am already hella uncomfy with Valorants Anticheat.  


In this game there is an interest to cheat since you can sell things for real life money on secondary markets so people would be keen on trying to find exploits in such an anti cheat and that would be a disaster if a kernel level anti cheat were to be implemented.  


Its really sad to see how alot of annoying restrictions ingame that have been added to combat this stuff doesn't help one bit with the cheater infestation."

ThazmoTTV,"My favorite is the closet hackers who pretend like they aren’t using hacks but make 2 left turns one right turn and run down the hallway to the 4th door and open it and check the bathroom you are hiding in, all nonchalant"

WH4L3_88,Damn. I don’t think I’ve ever seen it this bad before.
coscho13,I ran into someone using the exact same cheats and killed me the same way on night customs. His name was like EliteMeleeSkill lol
madnoose,Thanos snapped
Elm_road,"Labs is currently unplayable. I was on the hard grind up until level 15 this wipe. Finally get a labs card, hesitantly queue up labs, take literally 3 steps and I got head,eyes. GG BSG"
AltruisticAsk4295,Happened to me on streets 2 days ago
Argonile,I recommend reporting VOIP if they also just be a negative person or admit to cheating. Seen buddy on a livestream play labs and walked around with someone who was cheating and suddenly his body dropped dead lol
SpreadBoring4498,This game is a mess right now with all the hackers
murrkpls,Wait until Dark and Darker drops and play that instead. Trust me on that one.
V4ALIANT,"honestly, these types of cheaters don't piss me off as much. It's the ones that are subtle with wall hacks that really piss me off. If i see one of these i can accept the outcome and even laugh about it but its the assholes that try to hide it that are the worst ppl (there are more of them too)"
Jordandavis7,"Dude this is so lame. How the hell is this fun? I don’t get it, these ppl are pathetic losers"
HigherCommand,"""He's not cheating! That's just a feature you NOOB!!!! OMG YOU REALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS HACKS??"" I wouldn't be surprised that the people saying stuff like that are the hackers themselves."
Infinitykiddo,"1s shot miss
2 nd 3 looks like it bounced
4,5 nd 6 clearly miss
8 nd 9 looks like desync

idk bro prob skill issue imo"
Floatzel404,My desire to play the game drained quicker in this wipe than it has ever before
ratcrash55,i have seen the aladins die so they can take damage i think when they land on the ground sometimes due to terrain they become vulnerable because they always seem to try and hurry and float again. just based on videos not sure if thats how it works.
SuperRektT,How fucking pathetic the fact is that he talks to you normally and then he kills you. Fucking scrub.
reaperinio,"i got lucky lab access keycard on my scav in the first week of wipe. i went labs with my friend. ofc we met cheaters. running with no armor and helmet, only fiveseven , tapping everything that will cross his path"
