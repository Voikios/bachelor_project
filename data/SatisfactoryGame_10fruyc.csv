Xqclprime,no in germany we would say TREIBSTOFF
vlsdo,TIL German is just mirror English
Nailfoot1975,Give me LEUF Give me ERIF Give me that which I desire!
Th35tr1k3r,Guys guys it says fuel if you read it from the inside. How else is the fuel inside supposed to know that it is fuel?
hobbitdude13,"English side ruined. Must use German instructions!

Le LEUF? What the hell is that?"
MalleusManus,It looks correct if you are inside the container.
holdmonero,Faulty AI limiter! Your constructors are creating their own language and are becoming sentient!!
Xtermo,You expect ficsit to have mirrored molds when they can just cast the same one twice and flip one inside-out?
cillano,Sorry but German Fuel would be TREIBSTOFF! So yeah... unplayable
Irdogain,"Sounds more like french to me as a german, e.g. â€žun oeufâ€œ"
Freakscar,"Nah, if that were German, it'd be spelled ""á–·á–·OTÆ§ê“­IÆŽÐ¯T"", obviously."
sauceofhap,It's important to let what is inside know that it is fuel
RednocNivert,"I thought they patched this!

Literally unplayable."
JustAnInternetPerson,Kamerad! Die Korrekte Bezeichnung ist Treibstoff!
Video_Mode,"Le Grill??

What the hell does that mean?!"
McWolke,"i wonder, why did you think it's german? the devs aren't even german"
plenebo,looks unplayable
msanangelo,"is it a bug or are devs trolling us?

you decide! XD"
Exatomos,Sounds like French to me
WiseassWolfOfYoitsu,"Nonono, it's French for beef. Those are full of hamburger."
King_Kasma99,Sie meinen TREIBSTOFF guter Herr.
P-Clark,"Indeed it is. Leuf (pronounced \[l É”ÉªÌ¯ f\]) is a word that is derived from ""LÃ¤ufer"" which translates to ""runner"" or ""someone who's job is running"". It is also used in context of deliveries. ""Der PizzalÃ¤ufer"" would be ""the person who runs with a pizza"". Therefor the stem of the word is also used in other delivery options. Such as this fuel canister. For differentiation between people and objects the ""Ã¤u"" is replaced with ""eu"" though that does not change the pronounciation. And then you've arrived at ""Leuf"" referring to an object that transports/delivers other stuff."
Arcadius274,"Lol if a single backwards word makes something unplayable, then you may wanna avoid those pre release titles. Atleast I don't randomly fire into the air anymore"
AcceptableDurian2476,"Thats how you know its authentic, if it were forward then it'd be a knock off"
TheySaidGetAnAlt,"I'll have you know, this is slander. We call fuel **Treibstoff**."
AwesomeJames2120,"God damn I like those colours, post the colour thing uwu"
andocromn,My dyslexic brain read this no differently than I have to read everything else
walker42000,You git
HazmatikNC,"Ficsit does not waste, having two dies to stamp the words opposite directions was inefficient."
Kirlocca,Not german but might be a simplified version of *l'Å“uf* the french word for egg. So maybe french eggs in that container?
thesinginggamerYT,backwards fuel
SamohtGnir,"Can you go get me a barrel of 710? 

Thanks."
GenAce2010,"/s

Literally unplayable. Can't read the container, have no idea what is inside of it. How am I supposed to refuel my chainsaw and tractor?

0/10 would not recommend. 

/s"
Stickel,I understand this reference
bobtheboberto,"It's the same reason Ambulance is backwards on the front of an Ambulance. It looks correct in your rear-view mirror. If I was in my explorer and saw ""LEUF"" in my rear-view mirror I wouldn't know what to do."
Capa_D,Liquid Enhanced Uranium Fuel. Should be in the fifth space elevator fase. Ficsit is always prepared.
kullre,how do you guys get past the stingers
mooshoopork4,Well. Back to the drawing board
Jaroldo3,Would be great if alt recipe flipped it lol
dcmforsure1,It's fuel backwards
Lost_Photograph_1884,It's just upside down and backward.
pigfeathers,No it's French
bad_bender,"Na. That is totally unplayable.
I recommend uninstalling and refunding ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£"
Nervig2001,Iâ€™d say this makes it a little more playable
RMSHN,"That's a very engineering joke for those who understand technological processes of making these things. So you need to use a pressform that is a mirror to a product. And if a designer of the pressform don't mind he can make this mistake and write it on a pressform without mirroring, so in the end you will have such mistake on a product."
No-Obligation7435,I bet it looks right on the other side lol
charlieli_cmli,Literally unplayable!
