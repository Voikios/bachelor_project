Valeigoras,Looks amazing! How long to build?
Specialist8602,This is basic walls done right. Well done. Fantastic design.
chintaka,The first pic makes me want to smash a printer in a field with my buddies.
Capn_Cinnamon,At first I legit thought this was a drawn/painted art. Incredible!
dshatneriii,"If this is your first attempt got-dam! Very very nice. Your choice to recess the long window rows I think was a key to this build reaching a higher level (note taken, lol).

That's the style I go for also in my builds. I take lots of screen shots of IRL factories and warehouses and then try to build my own-spun imolgamations in the game. Best game ever!"
Mariec_KOT,"Beautiful factory!

How you get so beauty graphic on 1st screen? Do you use graphic mods?"
JG109_Joker,Wow! Looks fantastic!
darrenmt10,"Fantastic looking build, very clean. Great work!"
PepeLepewpew-1980,"looks very cool, with the windows put more back, looks like the building has more edges and therefore more form.

thanks for the inspiration :)"
python_artist,This is fantastic
Blend_Space,"Nice, overlaying the basic walls with the steel frames works really well, I use it a lot in my factories"
Strikox,Absolutely stunning. There's so much details everywhere you look I love it
Gonemad79,You can make a panning shot of your factory as a video and submit it to Wallpaper Engine as a screensaver or desktop background.
False_Satisfaction14,"This is tops, but...we need to have more than 3 wall panel types and more sizes so we don't all end up looking too samey; variety being the spice of life 'n all.

This is so good, I'd like my factories to be just as good... BUT DIFFERENT,vertical wall panels, smaller wall panels and larger, a start;drag and stop sized wall (1m increments) we need a flat panel that takes paint like the trains do, or the lighting panels do. how about selecting a group of panels and applying a render ( colour, texture and merger of all inter-connected panel border so it one big shape selected area. MORE Wall Types and styles CCS, give the engineer the tools to create bigger ; better; Differently, or the modding community hopefully will

Top work Creator."
Vancity_turtle,Damn this is nuts. Well done !\~
Grand_Grand5452,that is not an attempt. this is a success.
IndiscreetLurker,"Your use of beams is really top notch. I like the way you've lined your foundations and catwalks with beams so they don't just look like bare edges, and the diagonal supports also go a long way to break up the straight lines everywhere."
T_Squizzy,"I love it, so much better than my first attempt.  On the next one, maybe mess around with color because it's very interesting, very realistic, and very silver ðŸ™‚

But, as someone who's spent a lot of time working in manufacturing plants, this does look like the future"
Invertdoctopus,People make some gorgeous looking stuff in this game. I just started and my factory is out in the wilderness. I work on my stuff out in the rain. Some day I too will have a pretty building of my own. Good job!
GuruTenzin,I absolutely love that train station. Beautiful factory!
Sid_RIvera10,This looks dope!!!
eboo360,How do you build that way? Machine first then build around? I'm still only making boxes and/or platform and only recently discovered windows.
KOOoOX,"Nice one ðŸ™‚ I would love to see if the devs of that game put more emphasis on design objects, nice walls and foundations, stuff for decorating... I really learned to love this aspect more and more... It's not only quantity that counts..."
Laellion,This makes me want to get back into the game. .
Delroy1989,Awesome build
