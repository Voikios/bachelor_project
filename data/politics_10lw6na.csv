lucifersam94,"Man it‚Äôs like GOP wants to keep doing 2022 all over again forever. Keep ramming anti abortion shit down everyone‚Äôs throats, and while you‚Äôre at it, flirt heavily with a national sales tax. SURELY that will work for them"
sarcastroll,"Outstanding!

Our wives, daughters, sisters, mothers, friends, neighbors, and coworkers can make their own decisions about what's right for them and their own bodies."
newnemo,"Woohoo!

>The education and health committee blocked the proposed abortion restrictions with a 9-5 vote, officially defeating the 15-week ban, a near-total ban and a ban on the procedure later in pregnancy. Although the near-total abortion restriction was more extreme, the 15-week ban was the focus for many Virginia Republicans after Youngkin made it a priority in his December budget proposal.

...

>Virginia Senate Majority Leader Louise Lucas (D), who is on the subcommittee that defeated the three abortion restrictions, tweeted about the victory on Wednesday night.

>‚ÄúAll of Glenn Youngkin‚Äôs bills to limit abortion rights come to my committee. I put them straight into my trash can,‚Äù Lucas tweeted with a photo of her throwing the bills in a garbage can.

Article continues...."
YesItIsMaybeMe,"Good. Youngkin has put forth only 1 good proposal, but then like 40 ass-backwards authoritarian bullshit. Him and his entire family can suck a dick, especially his son fond of voter fraud."
ThatDerpingGuy,"> Virginia Republicans knew the bill would likely fail after Democrats won a critical state Senate seat in a special election earlier this month.

Shoutout to the Progressive Victory organizers and the Vaush community for helping with that one. Dunno how much impact they actually had, but any push for more canvassing and phone banking by progressives to help protect our rights is great stuff."
whynotwhynaught,"Remember everyone, when someone online says that democrats don't do anything, they are probably republicans masquerading as democrats or progressives for no other reason than to generate apathy and depress turnout.

There has been, as we saw in 2016, a massive right wing effort online to use psychological warfare against voters to harm turnout for democrats. 

This is what happens when you actually do elect democrats."
Particular-Pace8344,"I really wish Democrats would refer to the Republican position on abortion as ‚Äúforced childbirth.‚Äù Enough with the light euphemisms, call it what it is."
joepez,As other states have shown that while these efforts are great this win is not the end. OK legislators (and other state and federal) are already trying to push beyond the will of the people.
Arcadian1,Dude literally campaigned on banning a college-level course from being taught in middle school that was never actually taught in middle school.
InevitableAvalanche,Always nice to see religious extremists defeated.
Tart-Pomgranate5743,"It just amazes me how many GOP politicians apparently think that stricter abortion laws will help their candidacy on a national level‚Ä¶ especially when voters have demonstrated repeatedly it hurts their campaigns. Winning over the evangelical faction is one thing, swaying moderates and the independent voters is quite another."
Proud3GenAthst,Republicans: I'll fucking do it again
bubbaeinstein,Republicans:  Life begins when you buy the woman a drink.
mlc885,"I thought Virginia was getting a lot better until Youngkin won, though I know Trump is visceral proof that the country is doing worse than you might hope."
Doodledoood,Thank you Virginia for doing the right thing!  Kudos.
BrownEggs93,*Fuck* the GOP.  They just can't quit this bullshit.
Scarlet109,Thank fuck
BonIsDead,Good. Glenn Youngkin is a fucking loser. Pathetic human being who should always be humiliated. Never let them feel comfortable in public to remind them of the rights they continually try to strip away.
Rule-Advanced,Glenn Youngkin is an asshat and most Virginians that can read hate him.
Jpalin6,See you in 2024 when the GOP will loose more seats in the House and Senate.  OUT OF TOUCH
MadHatter514,"To be honest, I kinda think Youngkin was hoping this would happen as well. This way, he can move on and focus on other things, and tell the base ""I tried my best, but the darn Democrats stopped it."" He continue crafting his profile for president and can ignore the whole abortion thing, which was gonna be a lot more controversial for his future run if it actually got passed."
Upbeat-Conflict-1376,GOP and Democrats are not the same
netxnic,"I‚Äôm a Virginian who voted for the democrat in the special election, and to this I say *thank fuck*. Our entire house and senate will be up for re-election later this year though, so not sure if I should hold my breath."
GameShrink,"It's almost like Republican policies aren't actually popular, and their politicians only win when Democrats run equally corrupt corporate goons against them."
Dinodigger67,republicans will alway be able to get abortions for their mistresses and daughters
Silverseren,"It's interesting that these bans led to a massive under result during the midterms, but Republicans think that pushing them even harder will make the next election results better?"
tyler_t301,"""anti-choice"" is absolutely how this should be discussed.. no more of this overly-charitable ""pro-life"" BS ‚Äì We know they DGAF about their lives"
FyreEyedTiger,"Good on you, Virginia."
Realistic_Expert717,GOP doesn't give af about governing.
shoretel230,"Very interesting for a gubernatorial candidate who did nothing but campaign on schools.


What a ü§°"
NuteIla,"Not to mention we've had legal cannabis with no way to legitimately buy or sell it besides a 4 company medical monopoly....

It's getting tiring..."
peepeehalpert_,Good. Leave women alone.
cptHARAMBE21,I cannot like this enough.  Congrats and good job!
NefariousnessPure799,Don‚Äôt like abortions - don‚Äôt have one. Otherwise stay out of MY MEDICAL CARE. What happened to HIPPA for women?  Why do only MEN get body autonomy?
whydigettwoaccounts,But can we appreciate [Senator Lucas's Trash Can ](https://twitter.com/SenLouiseLucas/status/1618100755805925376?t=RGuElQH9oFqf2vvVnADcRg&s=19)
spook30,"Cool, now let's do Florida."
duckinradar,"As shitty as this is, I‚Äôm glad to hear folks are voting it down. 
If we could vote the Supreme Court out or install term limits or tighten vetting procedures or‚Ä¶ idk hold Thomas accountable for his wife‚Äôs fuckery and hold them to conflict of interest standards‚Ä¶ that‚Äôd also be great."
Lost-Fly-3764,It's amazing that we are still having this discussion in the 21st century.
all_of_the_lightss,"These clowns are going to defund and distract until 2024 November so Trump can run on the same platform of Joker running Gotham.

If he doesn't croak first"
MrD3a7h,"Liberty lives for another day. 

Tomorrow is another battle."
AceCombat9519,Way to go for the [Democratic-controlled state senate in Virginia](https://ballotpedia.org/Virginia_State_Senate) to defeat Gov Youngkin's abortion ban which is modelled after GOP abortion bans in parts of the former Confederacy and parts of the Great Plains
Autumsraine,"Awesome, I'd also like to add: 

‚ÄúHow about we treat every young man who wants to buy a gun like every women who wants to get an abortion ‚Äî mandatory 48-hour waiting period, parental permission, a note from his doctor proving he understands what he‚Äôs about to do, a video he has to watch about the effects of gun violence,‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs close down all but one gun shop in every state and make him travel hundreds of miles, take time off work, and stay overnight in a strange town to get a gun,‚Äù the post continues. ‚ÄúMake him walk through a gauntlet of people holding photos of loved ones who were shot to death, people who call him a murderer and beg him not to buy a gun.‚Äù

&#x200B;

UNTIL this happens, there will be no fairness and equality"
a-snakey,Youngkin: Ok but what about a 15.1 week abortion ban?
stclvr53,üçæüëèüëèüëè
Careful_Clock_7168,I'm tired of the Maga Republicans do not want to compromise with the Democrats for the American people. Maga Republicans are very greedy
UrSparePartsBudd,"I love it

Big win for our purple state"
elissalandi0604,Yay Democrats! Imagine a world with only Republicans filled with miserable parents of miserable unwanted children...
mackinoncougars,Never vote GOP
Politicsboringagain,"""Both parties are the same, they are two wings of the same bird, there is no difference in voting for a democrat vs a republican. I am just an ignorant contrarian""."
AdministrativeBuy803,Great effort to kill the ban.
classof78,"Gee, almost feel bad for these GOP saps seeking to win the presidential nomination from the right wing.  To win the primary, ya got to be the most extreme candidate, but then try and pivot to have a chance in the general election. 

Ok, I lied, I don't almost feel bad for them at all"
2OneZebra,Glenn is a tool.
Roxfaced,I am Virginian and I didn‚Äôt know this until 30 minutes into Redditting before bed?
,slay virginia
HermesTheMessenger,"He wants to win the election for President in 2024 or 2028.

His hope is that;

1. The Democrats run a horrible candidate.

2. If they don't, that few people vote for the Democrat.

3. That all the rabid anti-life misogynists are going to flock to his candidacy.  

1 & 2 could happen, though Youngkin is a horrible candidate too, and there's the bit about more deaths due to the anti-abortion laws in red states.  

I won't say he doesn't have a chance, though every current contender for the Republican nominee for President are nightmares.  I don't expect that to change."
Over_Swordfish3554,Fuck Youngkin.
Commercial_Board6680,"I feel as if I were in some fucking horrific time warp. I still can't wrap my head around reading headlines like this all these decades later. Getting old sucks, but watching history repeat itself in one lifetime fucking sucks."
KegelsForYourHealth,This guy has resting pedophile face.
CourageKind,Fuck you Glenn Youngkin!
MrFoxManBoy,"If you can‚Äôt come to the table with legislation supported by science and medicine, then fuck off back to the hole you crawled out of, as far as I am concerned. 

These christo fascists need to go"
Fynn_the_Finger,"So glad the Senate wasn't up for election in 2021, or this would have passed."
thebardbecoming,"As long as we're being dragged into court rooms to defend human rights, we're losing this fight."
AsterEye,Hell yeah
jibblin,I‚Äôve been saying this a while. We should let the GOP govern every so often because the country gets to see just how shitty they are. It‚Äôs also why the filibuster should be eliminated. Letting the GOP govern would be their own downfall because everything they do is unpopular.
SkyviewFlier,"All this talk about about abortion issues... Those are just symptoms. Let's bring back the ERA (Equal Rights Amendment) and fix things once and for all (for all, get it?)..."
Odd_Status_9326,Another wannabe dictator.
466redit,"Because MAGA really means make America goofy again. It also means greedy, gross, (de)generate again."
ItisyouwhosaythatIam,"I'm Catholic and hate abortion. So I don't want my wife or daughter to have one. But it's their body and their decision. I don't  have the right to impose my religion on another American's body. 15 weeks seems reasonable to me, but I'm not going to support the government telling all women to adhere to it."
fiestyoldbat,I'm so tired of this GOP trend of posturing by white male governors in order to appeal to some bogus national-level support for future elections. You're not representing the people who elected you. You are serving your own self-interests for future gain.
Olderscout77,"The general population of the US agrees on a lot more than is apparent. Both know the system is rigged against them and the politicians who legalize the rigging are all in cahoots with the Uberrich who write the legislation that enriches them while impoverishing the rest of us.

What is dividing us is the absurd notion that only by opposing Democratic legislation and ideals can the working-class Republican base get any satisfaction in their lives.  Why else do Republicans ""roll coal"" with $5.50/gal diesel and think it's punishing the guy with a Tesla?

George Wallace reportedly remarked he lost an election because his opponent had ""Out nword'd"" him, and that would never happen again. I thought it was pretty pathetic when I heard this in the early 60's but now it's the basic strategy of the GOP, *AND ITS WORKING.* The GOPerLords via Fox et al, have gotten the Republican base to believe the reason they haven't gotten a real raise since 1980 is IMMIGRANTS AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. when the real reason is Reagan's taxscam (and all Republican tax legislation since then) allows their boss to keep all the profits for himself instead of sharing with the workers who created the profits. Today's Republican politicians are reincarnations of George Wallace, they just have more targets for their bigotry and an entire national media network to yell it for them."
AustinBike,"Alternate headline: ‚ÄúVirginia democrats just handed Youngkin a lifeline by defeating his anti-choice agenda.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs face it, the worst thing that could happen to republicans is that they get what they want. The two outcomes are that their (minority) side gets what they want, so they don‚Äôt need to contribute anymore, and their opposition (the majority) are now energized and come out to vote. Kansas is a prime example.

I say let them do what they want to marginalize themselves, keep handing them rope, they will be sure to use it."
OlinWillms,This is definitely connected with Russia in some way. I think they are destroying America from within
coolyouthpastor,What is wrong with 15 weeks? That is a LONG time to decide.
Interesting-Month-56,"It‚Äôs not like this wasn‚Äôt the outcome Youngkin wanted. Now he can say to his base, ‚Äúsee I got your back but the democrats are out to get you‚Äù."
bonbonron,"Each day I open Reddit to another chapter of an American politics novel. The good, the bad, and the ugly."
Salmuth,They fucking aborted his bill!
bopbop_nature-lover,Bot he really seemed to hate doctors. 10y and or $100K

porgy_tirebiter,"Why are they letting voters decide? If even Kansas wants abortion access, obviously democracy is a losing strategy. Dictatorial pronouncement is the way to go here if you want results."
Swarzenpuken,8-9 months mama doing abortion is what true democrat want to see
ZukowskiHardware,"It‚Äôs anti abortion, not anti choice"
