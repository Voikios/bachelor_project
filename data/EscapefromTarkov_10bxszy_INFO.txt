{"Title": "Rengawr should lose his Sherpa.", "Post Text": "With everything going on with the situation I think Rengawr should lose his Sherpa status for abusing the name and power that come with it. Using a direct line to get a player banned because you \u201cthink\u201d he\u2019s cheating is a gross misuse of power and I don\u2019t understand how a Sherpa can be allowed to do something like that. After hearing about that why play? I don\u2019t wanna risk my account getting banned for something I didn\u2019t do.", "ID": "10bxszy", "Score": 6210, "Total Comments": 1145, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10bxszy/rengawr_should_lose_his_sherpa/"}
