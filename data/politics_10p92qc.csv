SuperGenius98K,What are the chances of charging him before his term is up?
,[deleted]
lunex,Does this mean George Santos will have to step down as Chairman of the Federal Reserve?
jsreyn,"March, 2027 ---  former 1 term congressman George Santos was arraigned today on 3 misdemeanor campaign finance violations.  If convicted he faces up to 9 months in prison and 1,500 in fines.   His trial is expected to begin next Spring."
LoadOwn9302,Trump and Tucker Carlson next please
atriaventrica,"In a country that allows unlimited dark money donations in support of politicians, how stupid do you have to be to actually commit campaign finance fraud?"

> In a sign that federal prosecutors are investigating gay Rep. George Santos&#039;s campaign finances, the Justice Department has reportedly asked the Federal Election Commission to hold off on any enforcement actions against the freshman member of congress who has become notorious for fabricating much of his resume prior to his election last November.

> The Washington Post reports that two anonymous sources familiar with the DOJ request confirmed that prosecutors are conducting a parallel criminal probe into Santos&#039;s campaign finances and that the FEC has been asked to hand over any relevant documents.

> Earlier this month, the campaign watchdog group Campaign Legal Center asked the FEC to investigate the $705,000 that Santos said he loaned to his campaign.

thedude0425,"I look forward to nothing happening because someone scribbled “SITTING REPS ARE ABOVE THE LAW” on a DOJ napkin back in 1922, and that napkin cannot be challenged."
MissDiem,"Considering they're 7 years into investigating a certain cult leader's campaign that was bursting with Russia, KSA, NK, NRA and other dirty money, he'll be serving multiple terms before anything happens."
martiztr,Kitara done fucked up
Skastrik,Wonder what they'll do when they realize his name isn't George Santos at all.
ringtailash,"Wow, maybe in 4 or 5 years, they'll consider doing something."
Comfortable-Wrap-723,"Don’t count on it, it’s like investigating Trump that after 2 years nothing happened."
,I see DOJ has opened a criminal investigation into George Santos's campaign finances at LIGHT (beer) speed.
frankdrachman,DOJ should chip in and buy Merrick Garland a spine.
The_Arborealist,"ok, thats a weird inclusion:""In a sign that federal prosecutors are investigating **gay** Rep. George Santos’s (R-NY) campaign finances, the Justice Department (DOJ) has reportedly asked the Federal Election Commission to hold off on any enforcement actions against the freshman member of congress who has become notorious for fabricating much of his resume prior to his election last November.""  


He's not George Santos *the gay*; he's George Santos *the fraudster*."
Leopold_Darkworth,"Santos is getting into big-boy trouble. Making up literally your entire resume isn't a crime, but lying on federal election paperwork certainly is."
afoley947,"Okay, so we have the official GOP VP candidate then?"
Mattloch42,That's a hell of a way to treat a Civil War veteran! Makes you wonder why he worked so hard for that Nobel Prize if he's going to be investigated for these minor paperwork issues.
ynnubyzzuf,"And THIS time, there will be actual consequences mister!

a $100 fine! Ten years from now. Serious business!"
_your_land_lord_,"Yawn. We sure love investigations. Remember we convicted and sentenced Bannon, and he simply said no and went home. Flynn too, said fuck yall and still lives free, and has a job. Chaney shot a dude in the face, J6 recommended charges on trump, none of this had any meaning at all."
Tiggerwasframed,Republicans immediately vote to end the DOJ.
Standardeviation2,"I’m glad, but have any DOJ investigations amounted to anything in the past 5 years?

I’m asking seriously. I’ve read about many investigations but very little justice."
Truck-Nut-Vasectomy,"If the speed at which campaign finance violations are prosecuted stays consistent, he could serve another 3 to 4 terms in Congress before absolutely nothing is done about it. 

Anyone remember Trumps campaign server having a connection to Russain Alfa Bank? In 2015? 

2015, by the way, was 8 years ago."
ExcellentPresent3,I’m so sick of his face
EmployeeNervous4097,"The DoJ doesn't do shit.

Who fucking cares."
Neidan1,"It’s amazing how fast the DOJ can get to work on people low down on the ladder, yet they pussyfoot around a criminal like Trump who tried to literally destroy the country."
cogitoergopwn,Merrick Garland is one of the best we got at opening investigations for decades.
TheHermitOfCarcosa,"Let me tell you how this story ends. 

In 2 years, George Santos fails to be reelected. He gets a pension for the rest of his life on the taxpayer's dime. No charges are pressed against him. He never sees a day in jail, much less prison. He will then be shunned by the Republican party and will quietly disappear until you see a news article about him some time in 2085 saying ""Former congressman George Santos dead at 94."
MountainAd4530,So I could just lie my way into congress as long as I don't do anything illegal? Interesting.
Artistic-Cannibalism,I'm looking forward to watching the doj once again failing to hold anyone accountable
LayeGull,Every time I see him I think. His ears are on upside down.
Izhyf,Its going to be russians. Guaranteed.
Chimaerok,"Too little too late, the damage is done.

Wish the DOJ would do their jobs on time for once."
Someoneoverthere42,"So, they’ll get back to us about it in, what? Four or five years? After he’s been re-elected?"
1mJustALurk3r,"So they will demand information about his finances.

*He won't give them anything*.

They will subpoena him to testify.

*He will ignore it*. 

This country is screwed."
EducationalNose7764,Another investigation where nothing will come of anything?
uuneter1,"I actually feel sorry for the DOJ. How do they keep up?! Hmm, maybe that’s the GOP’s strategy."
lookitsgordo,Seems like something that should have been dealt with BEFORE he became a congressman.
ProDiesel,"I’m glad this dude is getting focused as he’s a real POS, but they may as well open investigations into everyone in congress. It’s a cesspool of greedy politicians that grind money on the backs of hard working Americans and it’s disgusting. Insider trading and almost everyone in government is worth millions while making roughly 200k a year, fancy that.

Must be nice."
Acewrap,If Fred Armisen doesn't play this dude in the movie it's a missed opportunity
M_Drinks,Just once I’d like to see a politician actually get in trouble after one of these investigations.
Rapzid,Crazy the GOP hasn't effectively ex-communicated him.
Nightmare_Tonic,Wake me up when Garland finds his fucking balls
InevitableAvalanche,"If this guy was a Dem, we would have long ago kicked him out.  Says a whole bunch about McCarthy that he takes no action and just wants fake investigations and stunts."
ApatheticWithoutTheA,"Lol they won’t indict him. Garland is a giant pussy who will be remembered as such for not indicting Trump.

He’s cool with Republicans getting away with lying."
BenTramer,So they can expose his criminal ass like they did with Trump and then do nothing about it? Seems like another waste of resources.
Several-Signature583,"Yeah, and? Still waiting on criminal charges for Trump that never materialized. Santos will probably serve his whole term, do a 5 year run as a college guest speaker, rake in millions before this case is quietly closed with no charges."
justforthearticles20,They expect to have a preliminary report ready the day after a Republican President is sworn in.
choate51,"The real crime here is that Santos isn't actually rich, and the rich don't like that. Watch the wheels of justice work a bit swifter on this."
BlueRibbonMethChef,They probably have pretty solid evidence for criminal charges if it's going to the DOJ. Civil may come later as well.
BrownEggs93,"He'll still be re-elected, by the trend of things in this damned country...."
clejeune,"Great, so in six years nothing will happen"
captaincanada84,Should be a quick investigation. He evidence of campaign finance law breaking is right there publicly available. He forged a signature of someone that said no to being his campaign treasurer.
therapewpewtic,DoJ in a lot of trouble when they hear about George’s law degree from Harvard!
Richfor3,I hope the investigation won't interfere with him playing QB in the Superbowl in 2 weeks.
JC2535,"Oh, an investigation? So… just “Justice Window Dressing” that runs out the clock until people forget that they are mad?"
Best_Biscuits,"How long will this investigation take? I'll guess a couple of years, in which case Kitara will be out of office, but I guess that's better than nothing."
Amelia-Earwig,Mediocre white men always fail up in these United States. Merrick Garland is a perfect example.
soadkidlen,We did it reddit!
cj0r,Enough with all these damn investigations and committees... let's get some charges going. This is insane.
PurpleDillyDo,Nothing will come of it. Nothing ever does. He isn't going to jail. He isn't being removed from Congress.
One_Line4350,"DOJ is worthless when it comes to charging or convicting politicians, good at doing investigations that go nowhere"
finalarchie,"Cool, check back in two years when nothing has been done."
Degen_up_North,At this point this Russian asset will have everything he needs to report back to the Kremlin.
BearDen17,Define “Shit eating grin”
onthehighseas,"That won’t be necessary. We (all citizens) would like him removed swiftly and without red tape. 
Sincerely, We the People"
7fingered-meatcutter,"Authorities please read:

When they finally do arrest this guy, whatever his real name turns out to be,  I'd like it to be done on the floor of the house, in full session, where C-span can film the whole handcuffs and perp walk routine out the door. Just so's certain ""news"" outlets can't deny it."
atable,He'll be out of office before the DOJ actually does anything
Ancient-Meet8361,Wake me when they press charges..  This justice edging isn't worth it.
Majestic_Visit5771,They soft won’t charge him with nothing jack smith could of been indicted trump he’s letting time pass.
FizzgigsRevenge,"Like the black police officer who shot the white lady in Minnesota, Santos, the gay Latino Republican, will be the one they throw the book at. Meanwhile, career criminals like trump continue to walk free without fear of consequences."
Beerbonkos,I fucking hope this opens a can of worms for the GOP. They could have stopped him. They could have removed him. Hopefully it bites them in the ass.
crono14,Can we also indict the still serving members of Congress and people who staged an insurrection and coup attempt? That sure would be nice
Somehum,This MFer is gonna end up serving his whole term isn't he
IFeelLikeAFarmAnimal,How often do these investigations actually produce consequences for politicians?
AlmightyBracket,"lmao

everything was fine until the drag."
ebin678,5-6 years and we'll get an update
thisalsomightbemine,And now the GOP will defend his lies to the death and call it persecution by the democrats
Gurrrry,"Sick, cant wait for nothing to happen for 2 years and everyone to forget and move on to the next controversy"
cbbuntz,"If you were going to place a bet on how long his term will last, what's your guess?

I'm going with he'll complete his term because our justice system is broken"
SomeNoteToMyself,Good. Fuck him and the Republican Party that enabled him
iobjectreality,I fucking hate his goddamned face
ZukowskiHardware,"The DOJ that still hasn’t prosecuted the attempted coup, cool, I can’t wait for nothing to happen"
anaugle,Cool. Now do Donnie Dipshit.
Astralarogance,"What the point. Remember the ""investigation"" of Matt Gaetz? Nothing comes of these investigations. I am beginning to think all of this is a farce."
stewpidazzol,Has anyone had a run this good since Charlie Sheen?
SpecterOfGuillotines,"I hope they act. But I’m also prepared for them to investigate for a year, write a report that studiously avoids actually saying anyone committed a crime, and toss the ball to a congress that will do nothing except later write a report recommending the ball go back to the DOJ for charges."
Tom_Waits_4_No_Man,"So in four years, they'll announce the formation of a committee to discuss the possibility of forming an investigatory committee. But it can't be held too close to an election, so it will be tabled for another few years. Then they'll threaten to issue some supeoenas, which will take 6 more months to issue, which will be ignored and not followed up on. They'll form a committee to discuss how this should be addressed, and promise to televise it in a year's time.

""Santos to be indicted soon!"" the news will shout each week. ""The walls are closing in!""

What a joke of a country."
speaking_moistly,"every pic of this dude he looks drunk or high, am i wrong?"
matt_1060,He’ll still be in Congress when they’re done.
ToolMaker7946,That’s no way to treat a Queen.
ZellZoy,So hypothetically what happens if they find him guilty?  Jack shit or fuck all?
Templar388z,Why do I get the feeling he might flee?
Qubed,"In about 3 weeks, the entire republican party will be backing this guy and he'll be Trumps vice presidential pick."
EvelcyclopS,Tune in to DOJ press conference in 2028 to find out why they won’t do anything.
Nick_from_Yuma,"Pretty sure he just sold his original Hope Diamond to finance his campaign, right?  Or used his inheritance from Madison Hotels."
Hold_My_Cheese,Ron Johnson next?
Rune_Council,"Dude, despite having solid evidence and cooperation from the accomplice, they couldn’t put a case against Gaetz for child sex trafficking and just gave up. This dude is skating away no worries."
JoseJalapenoOnStick,Is it just me or dose he look like a chubby version of Tobey maguire
Hoobs88,"So now we’ll have apologist explaining that the DOJ is moving exceedingly fast, that no one understands how long this takes, that whole event is unprecedented, and compare this to some event that took place 50 years ago for the next 10 years. Great…"
Cole1One,"Merrick the Meek takes his shot at the easiest of targets.  Next, try anyone in Trump's orbit, from Guiliani to Meadows to Trumps family.  How about the Congresspeople that were part of Jan6?  wE hAvE tO vOtE tHeM oUt I gUeSs"
MC-Fatigued,I can’t wait for there to be absolutely zero consequences
MeatsimPD,Can't wait for 2025 when a special investigator is appointed
jusmellow,His smile is giving off massive pedophilic vibes. What a creeper.
globaloffender,"Oh good, I’ll check back in 10 years from now to check status"
fluffybottom,"They haven’t done anything about trump’s campaign finance crimes, why should we think they’d do anything about this clown?"
Chrusciki,"FEC just ignores it, DOJ has to step in to actually do something"
goldwynnx,I hope he flees. It would make for an interesting part in the movie that will eventually be made of this man.
Stonylurker,"Compromised DoJ… Merrick Mueller letting all those instigators from Jan 6th infest our government. Good thing he stalled the investigations into Trump and the Republicans responsible for Jan 6th. 

Fucking traitors are posting memes about how they “just sat in a chair” or that psycho Babbit was some kind of “hero” climbing through a window to attack politicians. 

Republicans were fully compromised by the Maria Butina Russian spy funneling cash into their campaigns and the NRA. 

If the DoJ was worth anything they wouldn’t have betrayed our country by letting this shit fly."
Shnazzytwo,Well I expect to hear something about this in 2 years
Budmanes,"Based on the DOJ’s track record, that’s a yawn from me"
Amelia-Earwig,Still waiting for DOJ to do anything against Trump.
sunnydaysahead2022,"Do the entire Republican Party. 

He got his funding somewhere. His funding comes from where all the Republican funding comes from."
ExtraHuckleberry,"By the time they indict him or anything he'll have been voted out in the election anyway lol


Unless they DOJ can do it without taking 2 years as usual"
Horror_Show_Halcyon,"Great, another open case that will go on forever.  What’s the point, honestly, with each new case being opened the value of DOJ dwindles."
EFT_Syte,"I haven’t seen a single gop ring leader be tried or locked up. Nothing is going to happen, this is just more grandstanding imo by the doj to seem “fair”"
xeonicus,"I just keep seeing news reports that the DOJ opened an investigation.  Let me know when something actually happens or Santos faces literally any consequences.  

This seems to follow a trend with most politicians.  There is a flurry of media reporting on investigations being opened about their activities.  Nothing ever happens."
ckwing,Why the fuck is lgbtqnation.com the source for this story?
third_account420,So they'll investigate corruption only if its a trans guy. But not legitimately.
lemmecheckit,They won't charge him. Garland is a republican in sheep's clothing.
soliceseven,He’s gonna be popular in prison
Acronymesis,Good. GOOD!! Let the DOJ flow through you.
Gnidlaps-94,Maybe check to make sure that’s actually his name while you’re at it
Srnkanator,"Every time I see his face, which is way too often, I just think ""yeah, that guy is guilty of some criminal offense.""

What boggles my mind is how much the GOP has doubled down on him.  It's easy fodder, we are cleaning the swap, liars, and cheats get handled. Kick him out and get a SE in Long Island. It's fucking Long Island.

It's like McCarthy is on a ship on fire, sinking into the ocean, with pirates closing in, and he wants the penguins to give him a ride to safety.

Sorry my man, that iceberg has made it's way already..."
HalcyonEnder,Finally. And thank you for a thumbnail that doesn’t show his recent lip filler.
AnxiousDeparture7213,What’s the point of an FEC investigation? What good will a money fine do?
DairyGirls,"I remember that recent interview with his ex, where he reportedly stated, ""I just have to get one term in congress, then I get a pension and healthcare for life.""

Oh Anthony Devolder, not only is that incorrect, it looks like you won't get to finish that one term you thought would set you up for life."
___77___,Looks like Randy from Monsters Inc
VapidRapidRabbit,"Well, finally."
Orbital666,Expect charges when trump sees some.
sednaplanetoid,Dude lives life like a Neil Breen movie.....
slacker346,"Ha, he's fucked.  You have to play these games after you get some leverage on people who matter, not when you're still a nobody."
calmforgivingsilk,How does his face always look airbrushed?
DantePlace,This guy is a living movie script. I feel like he's been created to be a distraction.
JohnnyPantySeed,Get ready for McCarthy's goal posts to exit the stadium
SirLavish,Finally! The wheels of justice are slow when its one of their own.
Banana_Rama_Pajama,Please get this clown out of here asap
munkychum,He should just announce that he's running for President. That one little trick seems to stop the DOJ dead in their tracks!
Pure-Huckleberry-488,Have the rest of the GOP started calling this a witch-hunt yet or is their plan to compare this to Hunter Biden’s dick?
raviax,Not that anything will come of it
zztop610,"Ok, he is gonna finish his term"
TeamKitsune,The gift (to Democrats) that keeps on giving.
Abba_Fiskbullar,Cue men's chorus singing [this song](https://youtu.be/TPeriSAdum0) in the background!
sgthulkarox,"""Another political witch hunt against Republicans!!  Our lord and savior, George Santos (aka insert list here, but we are sure GOD is among them), will deliver us to redemption!"" - Some drunken idiot with a show on Fox."
twesterm,"> Look, he was elected and he's obviously not that good of a liar. He knows we're watching him now and if he does anything too bad we'll catch him and then we can revisit if he needs to be removed from Congress.

- McCarthy if Santos gets convicted, probably"
itsnotthenetwork,"You know Donald Trump stole classified documents in topsecret documents and then withheld them when asked to bring them back, and then hid them even after the fact and nothing's happened to him.

 
And I'm supposed to believe that anything is going to happen to Santos?  Lol sure"
Ghost_of_Till,"Republicans were planning for this all along.

They said their red line for George Santos would be if he committed any campaign finance law violations. 

That will take a year or two to investigate.  Now they can just say, “out of my hands.”"
jack3moto,can someone explain to me why the republican party (as evil as they are) would want Santos to keep his position as they'll basically hand over that seat to democrats in 2 years if they don't swap him out for someone that actually stands a chance of winning in 2024.
