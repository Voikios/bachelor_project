Saxit,"The American Psychological Association has said for a while that mass shootings are contagious for the same reasons suicide is contagious and it should be reported in the same way, as minimalistic as possible. The FBI is on the same track. 

It wouldn't surprise me if any of the few mass shootings we had in Europe last year was relatively close to one of the bigger ones in the US.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting_contagion

At least stop showing the shooter's name and face all over the 24h new cycle..."
discreet1,The majority of gun deaths in the US are from suicide. It just dawned on me that the other numbers can probably be attributed to suicidal people who just want to take other people down with them. Yikes.

hey_you_too_buckaroo,"Not American but I recently listened to a podcast about how the police in the USA aren't legally obligated to help or save anyone. They talked about different stories where cops just ignored calls for help...those stories kind of made it click for me why Americans might want to have guns.

Edit: the podcast I was referring to https://radiolab.org/episodes/no-special-duty"
AnimZero,There are more guns in the US than human beings. I don't even know what the solution is any more.
IceKareemy,"Why the fuck don’t these ppl just take themselves off the board without hurting anyone…why do they have to drag innocent ass people in their fucking madness, shit pisses me off man"
Pyroechidna1,I didn't expect two cases in a week where old Asian men commit hybrid acts of workplace violence / mass shooting
newnemo,"Nothing will happen as even children lives haven't moved politicians to regulate.  

>""Nothing about this is surprising. Everything about this is infuriating,"" he told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell on Monday. ""The Second Amendment is becoming a suicide pact."" 

>Newsom clarified that he has ""no ideological opposition"" against people who ""responsibly"" own guns and get background checks and training on how to use them. 

>But he told O'Donnell that current regulations are falling short. 

...

>Newsom mentioned the role of mental health in mass shootings, but he singled out gun access as a factor exacerbating the problem.

>""I'm really proud of the work we've done in this space, but we've had decades of neglect,"" he said. ""But respectfully, I will submit that regardless of the challenges it relates to behavioral health, there's not a country in the world that doesn't experience behavioral health issues."""
Shryke01,"Caught the tail end of an interview on NPR this morning (sorry didn't catch the name of the legislator they were interviewing) but he stated that we are now averaging one mass shooting per day in 2023. 24 mass shootings in the U.S. on the 24th of January. ""That's all I have to say about that."" FG"
doowgad1,"Apparently there have been two more mass shootings since this one.

But Hunter Biden's laptop is the real story.

/s because there are people who would actually say that."
UrmomisKindaGay_,Police in the United States have no obligation to help you. Your safety is your responsibility.
Buckowski66,Proof he has no intention of running for President because that statement would ruin him in most of the south and Midwest.
Tyler_Zoro,"The second amendment isn't even the issue at hand. We could do so much more than we do now, without even approaching infringing on the second amendment. Just enforcing the laws we already have universally would be a great start."
dontlookricky,Followed by armed security
Orflargsy,That pesky bill of rights always getting in the way of tyranny!
SoCoFunCpl420,Never forget Blair Mountain.
boharat,"Please please for the love of God we need to invest more in mental health support! Think of how many shooters in the United States have ultimately been failed by the mental health system, and succomatu darker urges? There are a lot of sad, sick, broken people in the United states, until we start seeing that meaningfully addressed, I don't think we're going to see a meaningful downturn in violence."
dskids2212,Says the guy who walks around with security who have  weapons civilians can not even buy.
faxattax,“A guy killed a bunch of people with an illegal gun.  We need to make it *extra* illegal.  That will work.”
GlobalPhreak,"""California Gov. Gavin Newsom is renewing his calls for stricter gun control measures...""

The Monterey Park shooter used a crappy Mac-10 knock off, the Cobray M11 9mm, with an extended magazine, all of which I believe is currently illegal for decades in California.

If it's ALREADY illegal, how would making it ""more illegal"" have an impact?"
TheRealDrSarcasmo,"If I had an armed security detail 24/7, I'd also question the need for the common rabble to own guns."
DRSDetected,"In the bible, Jesus (the first American) said it's our god given right to own an AR-15."
Flat_Unit_4532,No shit.
cnopants,Given the majority of of gun deaths are suicides...
chickenpotpie3favs,"The shooter used a homemade MAC10 (sub machine gun) and silencer. All of the items are heavily regulated, difficult to obtain and already illegal in CA. No amount of new laws would have prevented what happened. What are you going to do ban raw metal and tools???"
TrevorX5J9,"Nobody considers that firearm violence is a symptom of a larger problem. What’s the larger problem?


The corporate money machine and our government. Nobody considers that our government is responsible for many of our problems, and the solutions they offer are lacking empathy and specifically designed not to threaten the corporate money machine.


For example, the root cause of American violence, goes beyond just guns and glory of violence. Our education system is on the decline, our healthcare is predatory, and our politics are trumped by corporate interest over citizen benefit. Our planet is being destroyed by corporations.


Factor in all of these issues, and you have a lot of angry people and a lot of conflict. How do most men take out their frustrations? Physically. Through violence, through physical means. Not all of them turn to firearms, but some certainly do.


Yes, it is easier to ban guns than it is to fix the root cause that ultimately will result in more problems (symptoms) down the road. Save a penny now, costs a dollar later. But the bill always, always comes due.


Additionally, Americans are hesitant to give up their guns because the government has shown time and time again, they will not protect you, nor is it their duty to do so. I refuse to give up my guns because if I do, nobody will be able to protect me, including myself. 


What do you do when the government says you don’t need these tools to protect you, but also won’t protect you themselves? 


Ultimately, we have one side (Red) pretending the problem doesn't exist, and the other (Blue) who thinks that giving the government more power is the solution.


**TLDR: Government indifference and corporate greed is breeding hatred, depression, and negativity that results in emotional/physical outbursts, some of which result in mass shootings and suicides. We (myself included, as a minority) won’t give up our guns because the government won’t protect us anyways.**"
Itex56,All I’m saying is Universal healthcare including mental health and a universal income could fix this shit.
Redsocksbuttcat,"Liberals… If you want gun control, go buy guns.


Almost all important gun control measures taken in America come from when the right see “the wrong people” with guns.

Hell the NRA has proposed gun control in response to minorities arming themselves.

They like guns when they think their side has them. When the other side has them, then it’s a huge deal."
vegancommie9999,Only the american government is allowed to shoot you to death!
DirtyMikeOG,Newsoms a fking joke get this POS out of here
Redbird_1978,"Wait, I thought those guns were banned in California? How did they get them? 

It’s almost like criminals don’t follow the law"
LazyRedEyez,Free healthcare. Full stop.
myth_buster_1,It took New Zealand one mass shooting to change their laws and here's the US who didn't do shit even after kids got killed.
Dragon-With-Matches,"Gavin Newsom needs to ask himself why the three mass shootings that happened in our country this weekend all happened in his state, and then ask himself why they all were perpetrated by guns that california already has outlawed.  Then he needs to ask himself why HE isn't able to control these outlawed guns.

That's a good starting point.  Let's not put the cart before the horse.

BillNyeCreampieGuy,"I'm mostly liberal, but I live in a rural area and own firearms to protect my family and property.

I'm for stricter regulations, but talk like this is a deterrent. Something Democrats just don't seem to grasp. America's an enormous and diverse country, with various regions etc. Blanket criticisms of an amendment that protects my right to own a firearm is off-putting even for liberal gun owners as myself. Which is a good indicator of how off-putting it may be for Independents, and certainly conservatives."
Astro_Spud,Weird how all their gun control didn't help
BacktotheUniverse,"It's not just about gun control, there are so many underlying problems that need to be addressed. Income inequality, education, Healthcare, etc."
jsylvis,"California already has the strictest gun control measures in the US and these things keep happening.

The problem isn't the firearms. The problem is people driven to violent extremes. [We've already done the work to identify how to best address points of commonality](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/27/stopping-mass-shooters-q-a-00035762?utm_source=pocket-newtab) and actually address expressions of violence rather than clutch pearls at the tool used. Neither Democrats nor Republicans are willing to actually do something, though"
vietbond,California has some of the most stringent gun control laws in the country.
Lowe0,"I'm a ""gun guy"".  I know none of my guns are hurting anyone.  But every time this happens and someone says ""my life is more important than your hobby"", I have less and less of a counter-argument to that.

Historically, there have been a lot of people for whom guns were a non-issue - they didn't enjoy shooting and attributed no positive value to it, but neither did they see it as a negative.  Right now, whenever a gun control bill is defeated, Republicans claim victory, but they don't do anything about the underlying violence problem that led to the proposed legislation.  If they don't get a handle on that, then the ""gun ownership isn't harming me"" argument erodes, leaving a net negative value proposition.

Thus, Republicans have a dilemma:

* Pass bipartisan legislation to target individual gun violence problems, and anger the nothing-but-obstruction wing of their caucus, but keep those currently indifferent to gun ownership from becoming opposed
* Do nothing, and watch public opinion continue to shift, irreversible for a generation or more

They don't seem to have realized it yet, but the firearms industry has the same problem.  They tout their gains among millennials trying out sport shooting, but it's going to be impossible to keep that momentum going if future generations associate guns first and foremost with random violence.

I realize the above is a pretty cold and emotionless take on the topic, but there are no shortage of emotional appeals already, and they don't seem to be swaying Republicans or the firearms industry."
SuperSaiyanGod06,Only developed nation in the world with these issues. Truly disgusting and disappointing to be in this country.
GregorianShant,This is a losing argument for dems. Fucking stop.
GringottsWizardBank,"Enhanced gun control isn’t even a solution anymore. We are well past that folks. We have 120.5 firearms for every 100 residents. Gun manufactures produce millions more a year and no gun is born illegal. Gun laws are like trying to clean up an oil spill while the tanker is still spewing it out right next to you. I’m tired of it

If you travel abroad for any amount of time you come to understand that life doesn’t need to be as cheap as it is America."
