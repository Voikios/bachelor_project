Repulsive_Basis_2431,"The animation gotten me killed a bunch on the navy ship , secondary and side arms are supposed to be there negate reloading and sometimes it's just faster to reload, I've mentioned it like 4 times on the suggestions in the discord, I hope they change it"
Kommodore_Krieg,I love this feature it allows me to shoot two bullets at once thereby defeating my enemies at twice the speed.
moorekeny1001,"I’ve used quick switching weapons to dupe people into thinking there’s more than 1 person, if you do it quick enough it makes it sound like 2 people. They pushed cautiously and I blasted them with my ppsh."
