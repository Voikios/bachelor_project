snaxx_23,Labor violations? I would call it funky work environment
TrustedJoy,Project assembly is the food court for alterra employees and the people working at the hardspace shipbreaker company (I forgot what it's called)
idgmo,You've made me realize something about my game choices that I can never live down.
Blind0bserver,"Think about it. It's a hyper-capitalist future where:  


\- The over-industrialization on Earth as seen in *Shipbreaker* has led to all of the pioneering and exploring of the frontier of space seen in the other games.  


\- ""Storage Dimensions"" and handheld rapid construction technology seems commonplace and exists across different designs and ""brands""  


\- ""Why would I waste money on building robots to do this when I can hire some *random jobber* to do it?"" - every company in existence

\- *Shipbreaker's* in-universe explained respawn system via cloning (and tying it to debt slavery to a company) absolutely applies to FicSit

\- There are clearly signs of other alien life out there, be it animals or sentients

\- *Satisfactory's* AI Limiter parts are intended to prevent the exact ""AI God"" situation that you see signs of in *Shipbreaker's* Ghost Ships

\- Corporate lobbying to erode worker's rights into being a hilarious pipe dream and companies treating employees like ""property"" as explained in *Shipbreaker* are referenced in both *Subnautica* and *Satisfactory*  


This has been rattling around in my brain for a minute."
Birrihappyface,"Fairly certain The Cycle: Frontier references FCSIT as an industrial employer, and Natural Selection 2 is canonically the same universe as Subnautica."
aza9999,How has steam never recommended Hardspace Shipbreaker to me and why is this the first time i'm hearing of it?
ATLSxFINEST93,I could totally see FICSIT being the planetary mining division of Alterra.
SovietSkeleton,"Slap Deep Rock Galactic on there too, which also happens to be under Coffee Stain."
Asio0tus,laughs in red faction
Sir_Olds_Alot,Might fit outer worlds in there too
Progenetic,I believe the cycle or was it frontier that had a ficit poster in it
BudgieBuses,"For real, sometimes Satisfactory just felt like an above water Subnautica, the vibe just feels so similar... both games even have a build gun"
ve2dmn,What about Deep Rock Galactic?
trollsong,"Is it horrible that I would legitimately sign up for a job like in hardspace.  
I mean if I was still freaking young I mean.  
Only living quarters with gravity, just give me a kindle and I'd be set."
Cryowatt,"Sure, it's all just late stage capitalism stuff. But I don't think the Shipbreaker universe is the same as the Satisfactory universe, simply because a deconstruction gun would eliminate the need for the manual labor."
Pop_Smoke,"I’ve never played Subnautica, I’ll have to give it a try."
ilikefactorygames,"Dystopian interplanetary capitalistic fictions don’t all need to take place in the same universe, especially since it’s not a very far stretch from where things are headed in real life.

I personally would prefer to enjoy these games without that terrifying background, especially Satisfactory that is supposed to bring a chill experience but still has this horrible “damage to fixit property” popup when the player takes damage."
lorddoa,This is where the evolution of the Caldari in Eve Online ended.  Megacorporations running everything
Vaulters,I wish Ship Breaker was multiplayer

2dollarb,"Something else to ponder:

In these 'universes' Humanity is gone.  Humans are extinct.  Everything and everyone is AI/Robot/Clone.  That's all that remains of our once great society.

______

The AIs in charge are attempting to recreate our society.  It's why society in every one of these 'universes' seems like a parody or mockery of Humanity; because it is.

Since there are no humans remaining, all that the AIs/Robots/Clones have to inform them of our society are the remnants of what was.  The expansionist dogma is just the new ChatGPT-AI-Overlord spewing out its interpretation of us.

______

Sleep well fellow Pioneers, and harvest it!"
BigMikeRich,"My dream game is Subnautica mechanics , with the complex resourcing and manufacturing  of Satisfactory, with just a little bit of action to spice it up"
Saint_The_Stig,"All in all, I look forward to all of these games being modded into Starfield in some form so they can truely be in the same universe."
Surprise_Corgi,"The only one I would find too wrong is Subnautica's, because thalassophobia.

If you paid attention to your living conditions before signing up for Lynx, having your own room in the quiet of space is a major quality of life upgrade, and you have to keep blowing up ship reactors to not consistently pay off your debt.  You'd be debt free in about 100 shifts.  Plus, hey, you got the yard to yourself while you work, and can stay on and make enough money to buy your own Gecko in a short amount of time, with all those millions you're making per shift.

Satisfactory?  You mean I get a whole planet to myself?  Fuck yeah, introvert's dream."
DutchDemoSquad,"I love Shipbreaker and Satisfactory (Obviously).  
I take this post as a sign I should try Subnautica?"
JayteeFromXbox,Don't forget Oxygen Not Included!
kawrecking,Shipbreaker’s income system is too flawed to be a dystopia. Ya you go 1.3b in debt but each ship pays you the worker millions in profit sounds like a sweet gig and the union is just whiny when you can pay off your billion dollar debt in a year and then go on to make millions
EmperorLlamaLegs,"I could see this timeline being early in the mechwarrior universe, before it all collapses into WH40k"
Pyreau,"I'm hesitant to but shipbreaker, is it good ?
I love satisfactory and other factory building game but it's not the same right ?"
RedditBoi90000,Love to see Hardspace Shipbreaker being featured next to Satisfactory and Subnautica. I love these games and I’ve played them extensively. Only games which never got me mad or angry.
GoodtimesSans,"I feel like Factorio would be the Green Knight of this table. Desperately wanting to escape this corporate hell, only to crash land on a planet and realize that they are completely stuck in their hyper-industrialized ways."
Glittering_Chest_707,I have seen FicsIt Tools while playing TheCycle Frontier
kael_insanity,im 98% sure FICSIT and Deep Rock Galactic are the same company
SnakeDicks69420,The build tool in Subnautica and satisfactory is also pretty much the exact same.
jaded_Eclipse,Would the Planet crafter fall under this as-well? Also yea that’s definitely an interesting theory
gamermanj4,"Absolutely, you could convince me DRG is in the same universe too.   
Also I think viscera cleanup detail and journey to the savage planet could fit into this also."
JeepJumping_Jonah,What about terratech? Or portal?
ahumanrobot,Don't forget Outer Worlds!
ObamaPrism1,Where rock and stone?
Dude_Illigence_,Space Engineers too!
Villerger_27,"Don't forget The Cycle!

I think Korolev and Ficsit have some kinda rivalry between each other. Given that Korolev has the ""hard hitting"" weapons, it wouldn't surprise me if Korolev shot down a Ficsit ship passing by/landing on Fortuna-III (which would explain why there are Ficsit crates on Fortuna)

Maybe Ficsit was trying to exploit Fortuna but lost to the other companies. Due to Korolev's rather aggressive weapons and behaviour, they probably shot down Ficsit lol.

Plus there's a poster trash talking Korolev in the bathroom of the HUB, and a poster making fun of Ficsit near the Lucky Leafman"
RednocNivert,"I was saying Factorio, Satis, and Dyson Sphere are all the same universe, in that order."
Its_a_Zeelot,Add Deeprock Galactic to the pile
applejacks6969,Could add Deep Rock Galactic
SomeRandomSkitarii,Crossover time?
ShrunkenQuasar,"Labor violations? It's not a labor violation if you make the labor movement illegal. We know that in at least two of these games, a labor movement would be met with deadly force."
leglesslegolegolas,Throw some *Breathedge* in there as well
Alfadorfox,"Each one a microcosm of a Stellaris playthrough as a Megacorporation. (The latest trailer for the upcoming Story Pack features a world getting ""enlightened"" by one such.)"
Adorable_Heretic,"Hundreds of Years ago a rebellious Rocker nuked a Corporate Tower in an Attempt to stop that Future. In the Grim Darkness of the 42nd Millenium, Factory Workers get ground down in the Billions every Day to churn the Gears of eternal War. Very fun Post, thanks OP!"
City_dave,"Don't forget the Alien films, and so their games, too."
TheRealSynergist,"Outer worlds also touches on a similar narrative. As an economist it's hard to argue that isn't the direction we're heading IRL. Minus that actual video game mechanics like respawn, obviously."
Master_of_fool,RimWorld would fit in well
Beat_Saber_Music,"Historically much of European colonisation in Asia was done by corporations, and in space where it will be expensive to explore and expand similar to Asia, it simpmy will make sense to allow for corporations to push the expansion as governments will be busy with other stuff. With corporations doing it, they reap the most benefits while also suffering the worst burdens while governments can merely focus on reaping the benfits through taxation"
Supersidegamer,"I wish hard space shipbreaker was more engaging personally to me, the writing and aesthetic really scratches my brain where satisfactory doesn’t"
thestareater,for Rock and Stone
Blind0bserver,"Side note, I have added... *so many* games to my Steam wishlist today thanks to this dumbass meme post. Thank you all for that, really."
Storm_runner426,Don’t forget portal
NoSuperman10,Hey! Don't spoil the twist of my crossover fanfiction before I've even finished it!
SteelBlue8,"My other little thing pointing to this is that a lot of the actual technology seems fairly similar, albeit with different visual designs- ie, satisfactory's build gun vs subnautica's equivalent, which are quite different stylistically, but both appear to work on the same basic mechanism."
Doc_Shaftoe,I'm surprised you didn't throw Dead Space into the mix.
Igoko,Throw ultrakill in there too as a more distant future
SexualizedCucumber,"If Hardspace Ship breaker, does that also mean Homeworld?"
PeacefulCouch,All astroneer needs is some evil corporate overlord and it joins this circle…
rempel,"Yes dude!! I’ve thought about this, too."
EidolonRook,The Planet Crafter would like a word :P
MuchUserSuchTaken,Isn't Subnautica tied to Natural Selection 2 as well through Alterra and the Kharaa bacterium? Things are gonna get quite hairy in this universe.
Sideswipe21,Ficsit is definitely an Altera competitor
AcezJensen,"I don't know if anyone has pointed this out yet, but there is a Korolev poster from The Cycle in the HAB toilet stall. And I believe on the map in The Cycle you can find cargo containers with the ficsit logo on them."
soEezee,"Slight tangent but shipbreaker is dedicated to the modern practice of actual ship dismantling and it's treatment of workers in Bangladesh Pakistan and India. No training, 12 hour days at $2 a day."
THomp76,Didn't the subanutica trans-govs ban weapons.
teufler80,"I hat at least the same feeling between Shipbreaker and Satisfactory, so i'm not the only one"
Apex7349,Subnautica is a failed mission of a corp from Satisfactory while shipbreaker is a successful version of a corp form satisfactory
ShadowRam,You forgot **Viscera Cleanup Detail**
EldridgeHorror,"If I love the first two, would I also love Shipbreaker?"
rokiller,All 3 of those games slap. Love Hardspace and Subnautica was so good I was genuinely sad to complete it. I want to re-do it in VR
wolflordval,"There's a poster inside the Satisfactory hub that references a rival corp from another game.  
The devs said it's an easter egg because the other dev team are friends, but if you want more fuel for the conspiracy fire, there you go."
FenrisWo1f,"Meanwhile, back on Planet Earth... It's all a Cyberpunk / RIFTS hybrid 😈

Megacities be megacity'ing... And some decker or fixer thinking to get out of the game sees gets a FICSIT ad in their daily dose of digital info.

[Would you like to know more?]
*Clicks yes*"
OlDustyHeadaaa,Rock and stone!
thesteeppath,"oh, yeah. it's Very That. 

i couldn't stick with Satisfactory (which is a Very Good Game and i love it, don't misunderstand) because i just got tired of the ""satirical"" Smiling Corporate Humor. 

like, come on. come \*on.\* humanity made it to the stars and is casually doing nano-construction stuff, sending people ""solo"" to ""industrialize"" entire worlds, and it's... just embarrassing meme-corporate culture? 

and it's everywhere. it's everywhere, just like your meme says. it feels -really- bad."
PorkChoppen,Add offworld trading company to the table!
Electric_Bagpipes,"Don’t worry about collecting those diamonds, you can’t possibly carry enough back to pay for the losses on the Aurora."
UltraChip,But you forgot to add <insert favorite scifi game featuring a megacorp that doesn't share any other similarities to the ones you mentioned>!
Oceansfourteen14,Whats the future?
HumanPersonMan,Don't forget Deep Rock Galactic
Matix777,Add deep rock galactic
Lack-of-Luck,"Honestly, some of my biggest complaints about shipbreaker are A.) It still seems really finicky, like the controls honestly just kind of seem inconsistent in the way part manipulation works, B.) There's really not all that much variety. Like, technically yeah there are *big* ships, but normally at least half the ship is just empty space between the hull and the actual insides. And what variety there is mostly comes down to the same ships with different colors or seat arrangement. C.) You're in space, why the fuck is there air drag!? Like wtf I don't care if I could drift away if I'm not careful (that'd actually be consistent with ways they've fucked with the menus to make it more cumbersome), it's maddening to push something towards one of the bins only for it to stop dead in it's tracks about a meter away unless you just spam the throw/push button."
JoyTheGeek,The real twist is its our timeline.
Weary_Ad2590,"I had this same thought for a while. When I started playing hard space, it gave me major satisfactory vibes"
atemptsnipe,Actually. The game The Cycle IS the same future as Satisfactory and it's pretty rough.
HugePurpleNipples,I had not heard of ship breaker but subnautica is an amazing game.
Ashley_Titor,executive assault 2 has entered the chat
questgamer2021,"natural selection 2 happens in the same universe as subnautica, but satisfactory... ehhh, too cartoony. i mean, if i had that tech in subnautica i'd be building myself the biggest ever underwater base on survival and keep phantom leviathans as my pets"
Fyzz51,Don’t forget The Cycle: Frontier
OffenseTaker,What if Ficsit is building the Aurora? makes you think
TakeshiKovacs46,"Well, let’s be honest. Because people are so weak in general, we’ve allowed ourselves to become slaves to a corporate ideology. And that’s a pretty well known fact. So any future we might have would likely look the same, but worse."
Warhero_Babylon,Well satisfactory and subnautica dont describe earth. In shipbreaker earth is basically a shithole with riots and millions starving
towerator,So I wasn't the only one to think SN and SF had very similar tech and lore...
Hera_the_otter,"Remember, there are no labor laws or unions in space."
halfoxia,"Factorio it's about a person ho try to build his own company, but the competition shut down his ship in a dangerous planet"
sargent_crumds,I love all of these games
aureanator,"Don't forget Outer Worlds. 


And you can't have labor violations without labor laws"
jasonxwoods,Shove Planet Crafter on your list too.
titobozzi,Journey to the Savage planet too
FodziCz,Imagine if its like the pixar universe
OCD-but-dumb,"I have this same theory! Though mine includes journey to the savage planet, what do you think of that?"
Toltech99,"In Space Engineers you are self employed. Only you get the benefits of your work, but there's a god trying to destroy everything that moves."
soundmagnet,Deus Ex kinda falls in to this category as well.
DdfdKing,Hards pace shipbraker is one of the most annoying games control vise. Good idea and execution but the controls made it unplayable for me
Masterwind13,Different work places safety amount depends on salery
Aetherium_33,Don’t forget about The Cycle Frontier! There’s a give it crate on that planet
Strudelh0use,I want to link all my conveyor belt games together with conveyor belts.
Fit_Dragonfruit160,"Please god please tell me they are all in the same universe, that would be like a wagyu steak level of good, and the ultimate crossover"
ectoplazmatic7129,Space engineers is the era right before them
ZikislavaJr,Also the outer worlds
KnightRyder,Stellaris would like to play.
Savings-Bread-1705,"And Korolev from the cycle, they look to be in the same universe, there are FICSIT boxes on Fortuna III, and a (heavily graffitied) Korolev poster in the HUB's bathroom in satisfactory"
Pasifisk1,"Regarding Subnautica, is it then a ""OSHA"" violation or an... ""Ocean"" violation?"
Razorray21,"my headcanon is the guy that survived in factorio, realized how effective it was to turn a planet into a factory, and started a company that was basically Ficsit. then bought by some mega corp to become the Ficsit we know today"
Emeraldian09,The Cycle Frontier also has Ficsit logos on some cargo crates
juspar,You could probably include Icarus and Planet Crafter in there too
Jumpy-Papaya-7892,"I do believe every futuristic space game exists in one single universe,and i have no evidence for it. 
Also,i do sometimes think about Nanotrasen doing a colab with Alterra and making a research station on 4546B"
