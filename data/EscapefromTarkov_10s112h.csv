TheFunkadelicOne,Keys are useless at this point.  I find better loot in duffel bags
ReverseResuscitation,The RMT hackers don't care about the loot changes to begin with because they can literally see items in your inventory and the items inside the duffle next to you. Spreading the loot away from high loot zones such as techlight only impacted regular players and is literally favoring hackers. They don't check 3 red card spawns. They know where the red card spawned...
Aceylah,"I've opened hillside house around 5 times now, but I've literally not got an item from it. Is it that heavily nerfed?"
Averyxxxx,"Holy fuck fighting reshala and his goons and duking it out with three different squads just to open the marked room and find a weapons case and limp to the extract at like 100kg was some of the most adrenaline pumping fun I have ever had in shooter games, I am all for bringing market room loot back. I missed my YouTube feed being filled with peoples crazy insane finds, now the best things we get are labs keycards, which aren’t bad, but variety is key"
DiViNiTY1337,"It's crazy how BSG thinks nerfing things to the point it affects people who are literally cheating won't affect the legit players. 

If you spawn in and can see every single item on the entire map, are able to go through walls or even pick anything up from anywhere on the map, while floating 100 meters above the ground unable to take damage, then yeah it's not gonna matter what you do to make it harder for cheaters. It's gonna be a minor inconvenience to them, and it's gonna make it much, much harder for Timmies. 

To be honest I don't really care if there's a guy selling 32 Ledx's on the flea, if it meant I wasn't FORCED to buy them off him. If I could go into raid and expect to find them reasonably easily then it'd be fine. That, if anything, would make it harder/less profitable for RMT cheaters, wouldn't it?"
2B_LEWD_BUTT,"I was as firm defender of those changes, but then I started thinking, let's take a look 3 wipes ago, same amount of cheaters, same bullshit, but less restrictions. Now we have, the same amount of cheaters (if not more?!) but tons of stupid fucking restrictions that make no sense. 

I miss making and buying custom guns on the Flea or just selling PvP loot on the Flea. The whole find in raid bullshit as literally done nothing against cheaters and RMT, all it does is fuck the normal player in the ass."
EnzymeX,"Fuck the loot, revert all the truly annoying shit like being able to put up only 2 items on the flea and not unlocking 3 slots until 10 rep."
IXCenturion,yes! i wish the good keys would be good again. locked weapon rooms should be 1/2 full with cool guns and gear worth fighting for. secure medical rooms should be worth bringing in a med backpack but keys are basically worthless. and their are 0 hit spots on the map. combine that with everyone having multi zoom scopes and suppressers your rarely going to have real fights.
Geksface,100% agree. The last 2 or 3 wipes have been distinctly less fun. All of the changes to combat RMT have made the game less fun for everyone else who isn't a cheater. It's all a half measure in lieu of making working anti cheat. The RMT people are hacking to get loot and lobby clear. Fix that and it doesn't matter if I can drop the machinery key to my friend.
williamis3,just loot kiba and you’ll realise what it’s like getting so blue balled
Savagenius,If they just boost up the loot probabilities then people wouldn’t feel like they have to RMT for things like a LedX. I’ve found one in raid in seven wipes. And then removing the craft for it just makes people more desperate. I get some things should be rare but hamstringing progression behind 0.0018% items is pretty lame.
Collguydev,more loot = more roubles for people = less RMT = less cheaters
Elias_Voorhees,"Just spend an hour on the *forbidden mod* and tweak the loot spawn rates but a smidge and you'll find out how many locations item **should** be spawning in. I'm talking Water Bottles, Aquamaris, and Water Filters in Water Room in Dorms. Y'know, *the room that should totally spawn at least one bottle of water in considering that's the water storage room in Dorms and is locked behind a key*?

Sure you could say that there's an overabundance of loot in such a case but the problem is that areas that common sense dictates should spawn loot (like fuel by fueling stations/fueling tanks/weapons in those notoriously empty weapon safes/tools and repair kits in obvious workstations) either don't or hardly ever spawn items there. 

If people getting rich too quickly is an issue, then create new money sinks. Stuff like bribing Fence so AI Scavs will be friendly to you for a single raid or opening up a Scav extract for your PMC to use, paying Mechanic a huge fee so he can craft some higher tier electronic loot for you, or maybe just regular upkeep and mataining of your Hideout besides replacing fuel tanks and filters?"
PICT0GRAMJONES,"Yeah then the rest of the map becomes a dead zone after the first 10 minutes of Dorms fighting ends. That was the complaint, everyone rushes tech stores, dorms, resort etc and just leaves after getting their loot and fighting. The loot changes make fights viable everywhere, I've gotten into fights in places I never had before. Best part is, you don't expect it so the rush is greater if you can survive the ambush or you both spot each other at a similar time versus going into the Dorm knowing you're probably going to get into a fight. To each their own."
BeefyZealot,"I have been saying this for 2+ yrs. They lost the battle to cheaters just like every other online game, move on, make tarkov fun again. We just need a streamer to make a video on if and we’ll be back to the good ol’ days! 

In b4 Nikita dick riders and mods show up."
Salami__Tsunami,"Nearly everything wrong with this game was the result of the developer breaking one part, in a lazy attempt to band-aid another part.

Low tier weapons and ammo are viable in combat? Better double the recoil and make them worthless. 

People can buy top tier gear off of the flea market without needing to play the game like a second job to grind out the RNG quests? Better take the good stuff off of flea. 

People can get along with mod-tier equipment? It’s time to make sure that first and second tier traders only have basic tier equipment. (The low profile AR gas block particularly irks me.)

RMT and no clippers are hitting the marked rooms within the first minute of the match? Better make marked rooms worthless. 

People are cheesing bosses and rogues for loot? Just double their HP and give them aimbots. 

I could go on. But suffice to say, all of these changes in the name of ‘balance’ have hurt the new players and the casual players far more than they’ve hurt the cheaters and the sweat-lords. Instead of curtailing the cheese tactics and the abuse of game mechanics, they’ve now ensured it’s the only way to stay competitive."
j0ven_,Don't understand why meds weapon ammo boxes can't be a 1-3% marked room chance combined. Miss that rush.
Frosty252,"it's pretty interesting how the game punishes you for playing the game.

too much loot? be prepared to not be able to move after carrying 1 extra gun.

can't find loot? be prepared to spend weeks trying to look for one item for a quest."
dimsumdonair2,"??? 

The whole point of dynamic loot spawns is to not have stagnant pvp 

So that you don't end up fighting only in dorms 

All the time. 

That is the most boring experiance I had back then,

Now I can encounter people outside of the average Hotspot"
Franklin_le_Tanklin,"> only labs has PvP 

….. wut? I fight players all the time. Just finished punisher and I didn’t go to labs once."
TheGreatWalk,"Keep the fir stuff because it prevents hatchet running from being a thing and encourages survival instead of speed running and dying to go next. 

Hatchet/moseling meta were boring as fuck to play in. They'd sprint to the best loot places, shove it in their safe boxes, then quit or go all in trying to get lucky kill.  The pvp was extremely stale as a result. Every kill you get was worthless because all you'd get is a dog tag and a Mosin, but every death you'd lose a full kit. 

Wouldn't mind some Hotspot loot buffs. Might even make rmt less of a thing, if loot is easier to come by but you still have to survive with it like you do now."
Mylez_,"And bring back old flea, I enjoyed ebay simulator! Maybe add a % chance the scavs take your $$$ to counter the loss of Found in raid requirements to list stuff."
pylorih,You need to spend more time at the shoreline resort at night. Place is popping with pvp activity.
Ok-Street-7240,"Loot nerfs and high tier gear removal from traders are without doubt one of the reasons cheating persist and will persist for a long period this wipe.
Since the game is now based on wipes a lot of players don’t have the time to grind or are fed up with grinding every few months so they just resort to rmt. 
Gameplay has changed a bit as well. Less geared players are running around while the geared ones hide and camp"
ThePatchelist,"That's the biggest issue that game developers need to understand... They tend to lose themselves in a war that can't be won anyways, utilizing means that fucks the general population.

Fucking over the majority of the playerbase in major ways just to combat some kind of malicious thing - in this specific way, changing the loot rarities, throwing in unecessary hoops players need to jump through etc. - which in the end is barely even affected by the measures that have been put into the game... Is ALWAYS the absolute worst thing that can be done.

But in many, many games you simply can not reason with it's developers.  It's their vision, they know it all, they know best - at least that's what they're thinking and working by.

An absolute shame. Path of Exile, CS:GO, EFT and many more fall extreme victim to this bullshit in one or another way."
PeregrineT,"Yes, only the developers were foolish enough to think nerfing the loot would hurt RMT, rather instead of the ENTIRE rest of their fanbase.

Making your game purposelessly less fun has never been a good strategy ever."
,"we'll never beat RMT or even cheating, sadly. and even then these are band-aid fixes that only hurt the larger legitimate playerbase rather than the cheaters"
GAIA_01,"my thought exactly, the anti RMT actions have increased the utility of purchasing cheats or RMT items, increasing cheatings prevalence, if you remove FiR add loot back, ect, you WILL end up reducing the demand for both cheats and items gained from cheating. reducing cheatings incidence rate and improving the game  


its time to turn back time, to the good old days"
AlternateImageGaming,"> I don't care if it allows some hackers to make money easier on RMT, their impact was negligible

It objectively made the experience with hackers worse. It was also always going to do so. Not one single change they made did the slightest to discourage hackers and nearly every change they made required hackers to be more aggressive in games to get the same results. Particularly for RMT hackers, they now have to take their carries in with them, kill the lobby and give loot that way, since they can no longer farm loot and drop it later.

All of the changes need reverted, regardless of the negative effect of the change, because it will again reduce the amount of hackers that other players have to actively experience. I'd much rather someone be able to easily buy rubles/gear/etc than me have to get murdered by a flier so that the same person can get my loot instead."
doxjq,"Are you telling I shouldn’t be grateful for the single t plug inside the room of a ten use key that cost me $2 million? 

Jokes aside you’re right. The lack of loot hot spots has absolutely fucked pvp. They’re all just dead zones now"
CHOOSEAUSERNAMEYAFT,"Hard agree with this, it clearly hasn't stopped the RMT'ers so why are we being punished?"
Zavodskoy,Fighting my way tooth and nail out of dorms with a weapon case from the marked room or similar are still some of my favourite memories from EFT
ugonna100,"Strong disagree. This is entirely the perspective of the gameplay they wanted to prevent. Rush to loot spot, rush to extract. Expect players at areas A, B, and C along the way. like clockwork

Before the loot changes a ton of maps had problems where the only viable loot was specific areas (like dorms) and hidden caches. Every map had a predetermined route you knew players were going **because they were the only places worth going**. Deviating meant you'd spend 15 mins getting no loot and maybe getting one tapped by someone you didn't expect.

&#x200B;

The game is just so much healthier now, you're looking at players having actual organic movement and unpredictability and you're looking negatively at that instead of positively. In me and my friends eyes, this has been incredible. You don't know whether you'll see an army of guys at dorms, you don't know if maybe that run they chose to just head to gas station and construction. Every match is fresh and it IS dangerous in ways and its now SAFER in ways too.

Theres a lot that can go on there but basically this is how it should be. Loot is findable anywhere, players are not predictable. Every match is different (except shoreline LOL). I would like them to unnerf marked room though"
tehmightyengineer,"Agreed.

The complaint before was hatchet runners going to the high-end spawns. Simple solution; tie the power into the doors just like Kiba. Both customs and reserve have power switches in the center of the map now. Simply tie the power switch into the rooms. No more hatchet runners.

Yes, you will likely need to ensure you have someone at the marked room before you hit the power or else someone will just snag your loot as you return from power but this is totally a good tradeoff for me (and heck, it gives the rats something from this as well)."
PanProjektor,"I Disagree. With old model, it was sj6 - hotzone rush - fight - leave whole fat backpack. Total raid time 10minutes. Yup, while raids dead in 10minutes. Now you have to travel, visit a number of lootspots, meaning increased chance of several encounters. Locked rooms on the other hand I strongly agree, those can suck a fat one, closed space full of disappointment."
SilentReavus,"You realize the RMT stuff is the drop restrictions and limit on items you can hold, right? You didn't mention either of those."
dorekk,"I would love it, but all the nerds who think they're ""hardcore"" for playing Tarkov will hate it. FiR needs to go, and anything locked behind a key needs to be worth it."
NotSniffles,"I’d say the FIR/loot changes have made the RMT worse. If items are harder to come by, people will seek other means to get what they want. Making the items required for quests not as rare and increasing loot spawns would be a start for sure."
NouSkion,Pleeeeeeeease just let me sell player loot on the flea again. Changing that removed all desire to play for me. Killing people and selling their shit was the best.
MKevinR,What tf is RMT?
raztjah,"Funny how OP complains about being killed by someone in a bush, in a random place, when he says he and his squad extract camped dorms over and over.

Altought I agree those hight tier loot areas should exist, the loose loot all over the map should also persist because it gives life to the all map instead of just a little portion."
That_90s_Kid_,"This is the reason I quit Tarkov.

They balanced the game around cheaters. Instead of solving the cheater problem.

They changed quest items being bought through Flea Market, the drastically slowed down leveling. The grind sucks. If you dont play nonstop you get left behind and out matched.

Key Farming and getting the loot in shoreline dorms was fun and engaging.

The game is built around RMT and Hackers. Not us players.

Havnt leveled past 10 in 4-5 wipes now. Its simply not worth my time like it used to be."
YogurtStorm,"As a player that sucks ass, I don't mind finding cool shit randomly instead of having to go to the stressful areas. Possibly unpopular opinion idc"
t4nk909,"Tarkov is a looter shooter? 

I thought Tarkov is a hardcore and realistic online first-person action RPG/Simulator with MMO features and a story-driven walkthrough. Whose main focus is surviving, not running around like w-key drugged-up chads fighting over E110 and a ""possible"" LEDX."
Tark001,"TBH it feels mad easy to make money still... i dont really want every game to just be people rushing medical etc and then leaving the map with their bitcoin or ledx. The game is more interesting without the option to just play it like a ledx farming simulator.


I dont get what people mean by ""lots of loot"", its still easy to make half a million in a survived raid on customs etc without much effort."
H3ssian,"""I don't care if it allows some hackers to make money easier on RMT, their impact was negligible""

Wrong...."
Conserliberaltarian,I love how people just assume the loot nerfs were because of RMT.
InertiaEnjoyer,No
Tehsunman12,"Dog shit game, won’t change. Don’t waste your breath"
Franklin_le_Tanklin,Nah
helpmepleas1,No. Fuck rmt
Megustanuts,This is why I play Shoreline most of the time. Loot and players are concentrated in 1 area.
Nockenwellensteuerun,"I’m in support of this. But only after the rampant cheating and RMT is taken care of. That would allow those features to return without any risks and we could enjoy it organically. 

Why the fuck isn’t bsg banning people who sell like 16,000 tetrizes on the flea market?

What’s the average amount of reports for cheating before someone is actually banned? I’d guess 380 based on how horrible cheating has become this wipe."
Yankthebandaid,"And remove FIR status on items. Let us buy, sell and flip all items on flea again. The changes only benefitted RMT-ers that vacuum loot a map. It fucked all the rest of us."
xxxDea,u/trainfender please do this
BchSV_FAN,"just wake up dude, they didnt change it to stop RMT.

they did it to push people to RMT because BSG is running the RMT&hacks business."
DrHighlen,"TL:DR  I want pvp where I know where the enemy is.





War is not fair you just have to deal with the bush wookie."
OnceWasHell,"Or you could just stop playing, You saying I don't care if some hackers make money is like you are admitting to buying rubles. How about no FU Cyaaa."
Azurealy,"I think yeah, especially locked rooms. It's just not worth it unless they make rooms have tons and tons of spawns so the odds of something good is better. I think if you really want to combat cheaters there's better ways. Like people selling 200 Ledx with 40.0 flea rep, ban all those people or at the very minimum investigate. Set up good loot spawns under the map that's impossible for any player to get, and if you have those items in your inventory at any time, instantly banned to stop vacuum players. Or do cheater servers where all cheaters are sent. That way they can still do whatever, won't notice, and the community won't even notice they're doing anything. Because that's our problem right? Cheaters ruining our games. If cheaters never killed us and didn't vacuum cheat the loot, we wouldn't care if they RMTed tbh."
Snarker,Definitely buff marked rooms and key rooms again.
Malirae,"All the changes that were made to fight back against RMT did absolutely nothing, just as everyone said it would. The only thing that those changes fought against was the playerbase. We have even more cheaters now than before the FIR changes.

I guess it's easier to shit on the player's time with shit rewards for hours upon hours of grinding the game than it is fixing vulns and exploits."
SignalHamster,it would be nice if key rooms got a buff but I dont mind scarcity honestly.
bcoss,"I literally just posted something like this exact thing regarding flea and the stupid captcha they have you do if you buy more than 3 items in 1 minute.  Get it the fuck outta here, does nothing and just makes using the flea for normal users even more aggravating."
eddy_brooks,"Yeah as much as i understand some changes like FIR, i found a GPU on shoreline and immediately left while my buddies had to try and fight without my help cause i needed it for task. I would’ve much rather risked it and continued fighting but as soon as i get a task item or high value item like that the raid is over or risk losing your rng progress"
Minty_Ranger,"There needs to be one or 2 top tier loot spots on a map. 

Kiba is a good example, requires 2 keys, power and once its open an alarm starts blerting out to everyone - you suddenly become a massive target. Its fun and its exciting for the looters and the rats. It makes it so you have to think and plan about what you are doing.

Places like this should be buffed - not every key room, just one or two on each map. 

Other maps could be adjusted to add similar things, power on customs, underground bunkers, locked rooms, areas guarded by raiders or rogues. All of these can have keyed access, with alarms, flares or something to make other PMCS aware."
Katie_xoxo,"i don’t even care as much about that change, i care about the fact that i can’t drop things to help my friends. destroying items when they’re non FIR and trying to drop them is so fucking annoying and obviously it did fuckall to stop RMT, cause it’s still rampant. just revert it. i don’t care."
hiddenintheleavess,"whether I am broke as shit or rich as fuck, finding dank shit in a specific locked room and having to fight over it is some of the funnest moments in game. after awhile everyone is ratting around looting filing cabinets and duffelbags, avoiding conflict so they can break even on the kits they lost to a head, ears they never saw (or heard). 

yeah bruh. game actually feels empty/pointless after like a month of wipe, and its because they constantly nerf the ever living fuck out of the loot. even Concordia 64 key has been nerfed, theyre actively already nerfing Streets, which has created these hot spot battles that havent been in the game since a year or so ago."
itsbrave,the action is definitely still there on shoreline but the loot is nowhere to be seen
HypetheMikeman,Yeah I’m not sure how dumb you have to be to assume that people who have access to loot ESP will be negatively impacted by making loot spawn everywhere. It just means that they can run directly to it and extract with 1/4 of the previous player interaction. Having the loot make high traffic areas was better for everyone as it increased the chances of everyone getting the loot. Currently it’s just the guys running at 8x speed knowing exactly where all the good shit is and then extracting after 4 minutes in raid.
DevilJabanero,"rmters can go fuck themselves, change the loot back I agree I want to have fun not get punished by some broke Chinese dudes hacking"
KingfisherC,Well said
GS10roos,I've never agreed with a post so much. Please BSG.
SweetyMcQ,"I tend to agree with you but at the same time like loose loot as well. Its fun to stumble across something good in random ass places. But, and this is a huge but, keys need to be more consistent at finding good loot. Like a lot more. Keys are expensive and the room locations are static so they can be fought over. Its time to restore loot rooms to being somewhat useful, especially for rare/expensive keys."
Ghost4530,"Bsg should really just undo all these changes they’ve implemented to stop rmt because clearly none of them work, so you can’t drop guns and gear and ammo to your friends anymore right? How fun is that? Your friend dies and you win the fight so you nab his gun for him for the next raid right? Or your Timmy friend who never gets to use modded m4 because he’s a rat, I think the recoil change was a step in the right direction backing off their statement of never changing it. Means we have room to move forward on some of the bad changes that again, didn’t do anything to stop rmt in the first place."
keynish,I tried to drop bolts for a homie early wipe and couldnt
ASIWYFA11,"This was changed for a reason.  With your system we get people spawning in and sprinting straight for the good spots.  If they get a bad spawn, they leave and requeue because why would they play other parts of the map.

This sub is so fucking quick to forget what makes this game good and how far weve come.  Its getting ridiculous."
bit32x,Did they reduce the loot in the loot rooms? I've just assumed that hackers have been long range grabbing the loot. Which makes it seem like the rooms were empty.
PresidentLink,"The reusable keys to locked zones with higher tier loot was one of the most interesting things to me when I bought the game. A much more unique looting method for a pvp game.

I loved the idea of that gameplay loop and how it make high traffic chad zones, but never quite made it to it on my first wipe.

Second wipe, bam, gone.


Dynamic loot as an idea was good. Implementation is dog shit. Loot pool that locked rooms pulls from should be much higher value and more consistently pulling from them."
Plane-Palpitation126,"Buff loot rooms, make marked keys single use and only drop from Cultists since they're apparently the ones that stash the shit in there anyway. Cultists need to be a bigger part of the game."
SomeoneNotFamous,Keys being worth only for questing is becoming quite annoying for sure.
Z0EBZ,"Spending 1 min to wait for death screen to pop up after dying @ shoreline trying to rush a ledx, or quests, or any other chore where you just rinse and repeat. Click through the screens after seeing that you didn't hit the guy at all, or that you shot some scavs so you're not sure if you hit that PMC at all or if you just hit that scav a bunch of times. Spend another 2 mins waiting to get to the main menu as the broken Tarkov remix song comes on, just to heal your guy (if you don't forget to heal that is because your will and spirit are broken, you just want to finish punisher 6 for your bigger butthole pouch, because the beta case is barely doable. Spend a min or so re doing crafts, then making another loadout for 5 mins because modding guns is a money pit but so fun. Spend a few odd minutes cleaning up stash, firing range drills, other stuff etc, then spend even more time waiting to find a match, then more time waiting for that one person playing on a toaster, then finally in game. Where you have to spend more time running, silent, running, silent. Then rat because you're a solo player for like 10-20 mins, just to get shot to a PMC @ 30 mins in raid while you are running out of resort with some goodies and like 4 quest items. 

Off topic rant aside, agreed. The game Tarkov is at now feels more like DMZ type looting feel unless you get that Tarkov special where you find a GPU or other good item after complaining how hard they are to find. Now, I feel like looting is something I have to do to keep making dumb goofy loadouts, not something enjoyable and interesting. Just like gambling, and not in the nice buzzed gambling, I mean the headache drunk, lost 100$ in an hour gambling."
No-Carry-7886,"They fixed a symptom and only hurt legit players and did nothing to stop RMT's.

The hackers have loot esp and vacuum they don't give a fuck where it is they can get it with minimal effort. They can see where every piece of loot is on the map and where all players are without having to go and check there. They are also able to get it without actually having to go there. It's why you see some asshole with 60 scav karma and 40 ledx on flea.

BSG is too inept to implement server side loot. They are too inept to implement esp detection on players and loot. They also are unable to implement proper anti-cheat hooks into their code to detect behavior anomalies even though the tech to do so is a decade+ old."
voidness-,"Remove FIR and remove the ability to shove loot up your ass during the raid. 

Also lock items in container during the raid so you don’t accidentally drop them by missclicking."

Countcristo42,"Loads of this I totally agree with - but the dorms stuff I just don’t get, in my experiance it’s stayed super high PVP over the last few years consistently"
N1LEredd,"I agree that key rooms need to be buffed.

JensKristian,"This is probably why I've huge urge to loot chekannaya 15, even though the loot is not the greatest. The hype of it is real and I had some okey loot doing so. Honeymoon phase will get over though and it will be a ghost building down the road."
FuriousBadgers,"KIBA is just an absolute embarrassment. I miss the insane fights in and outside of KIBA. You need two keys in the middle of an open supermarket with angles in 359 degrees of angles, the 1 degree is the door Infront of you.   


You need to go to the corner of the map with the likelihood of PMC traffic, player scavs and ai scavs resulting in danger and making a lot of noise. You finally reach KIBA and fluke opening two locked doors and then an alarm heard from africa goes off so everyone and their mothers know your inside. You make it inside with impenetrable windows.... Good thing you're safe right? Wrong everyone can see where exactly you are standing in the store and you have one door way vs 17 angles people could be peeking. You build the courage to peek outside and get some kills. You're severely overweight because your friends died getting power on. You waddle outside the store to an onslaught of player scavs to survive and make some decent roubles.  


Now i dont even look inside when im scavving and the alarm is going off."
ilover630015,Yessss the loot revolution has begun
Friendly-Unit,Yes game is alot more boring these day and the anti rmt stuff half works half just annoy regular users. Bsg won't do anything they seem to think the janky duct tape solution to the issue work
Collguydev,agree its only hurting legit players
swell257,"I miss the times in which you could find single items that were actually worth a fortune. I mean hitting a room where there could be a chance of finding weapons case or medicine case, for instance. At that time, finding a simple WALLET was always a heart pounding moment - does that wallet has a red keycard?? Let’s take a look inside!! 

I think the moment I had found a medicines case inside of a marked room was one of the most intense and frightening extract routes I’ve had. I remember dying with it and even having a blast regardless.

Now you just know that there isn’t such much of such thing beside static spawns of violet keycard that literally never pops up. Finding a wallet now means literally just finding a 6k roubles wallet. The only thing that is actually worth good money is a LedX, and it’s also been nerfed to the point in which it takes countless raids in one specific area of one specific map to find it. I feel like I never had that loot goblin heart pumping moments anymore. I just go into raids knowing that I have to find as many Prokills and COFDM Wireless Receivers as I can, and even if I’m big on them I don’t really get anxious.

The feeling of knowing for a fact that there isn’t some sort of jackpot to be hit makes the game stale in that sense for me. 

I wish they could bring those times back man."
FurryAlot,You forgot that the ammount of loot we had before these changes was always going to change to lesser amounts...
TheDrunkenFROG,"I hope we can get rid of FIR rules to a certain degree, I understand some of it like for quests and stuff. But why are items that are in your secured container not FIR? They still came out of the raid, I certainly found them in a Raid. 

Items in there lose all value upon there so why even have the secured container work like that at all. Might as well just be for meds and keys. The FIR only hurts people that are dogshit at the game, like myself."
Keeperofthe7keysAf-S,"They also already did make everything more expensive at the same time they nerfed all the loot.

I mostly agree but slightly disagree with what you're saying in that I mainly see PvP in the hotspots that still have loot like dorms and resort behind those locked doors, although nerfed, containers and safes still provide. But high value and loose loot items at these locations and loot spread throughout the maps in general is really low.

As an example, there used to be high value military items all across reserve giving reason for movement and fights everywhere but most of these spots seem to never spawn a single item anymore so everyone just rushes bunker hoping raiders spawned and then extract D2.

100% on labs though, the entry cards are too expensive/ hard to aquire to really run the map and if that isn't gong to be improved then the loot needs to be and not just behind ludicrously expensive keycard doors.

As far as dealing with cheaters, creating item scarcity just increases demand for rmt when people are gated behind fir items they can't craft (looking at you ledx changes). So really doesn't have the intended effect and is a sad excuse for not implementing a functional anti-cheat backed up by holistic data analysis (seriously how do you not detect and auto-ban what should be invalid inputs like flying or moving at mach 5?)"
Bslayer7111,"The fight against RMT is a war that has only made this game less tempting to play casually, i just wanna be able to play this game not as a full time job but with all the restrictions that are not stopping ANYTHING I can’t, they will RMT no matter what you do. Who cares honestly"
debloons,Totally agree. The entire playerbase is dissolving because the fun has been sucked out of it since no loot is left on the map.
Vore1998,Do this along with removing the found in raid status and I might actually want to play the game again.
weaveryo,"Y’all don’t know how to loot. 

But yeah go ahead and boost it. More loot will always make me happy."
shady531,"I shit you not, I opened marked room reserve VO, first time I had the key in a long time, and I all I got was 1 HDD. 500k rouble key -> 1 HDD

What a joke"
ILikeToHelp1,"It's just sad what they did to Shoreline, my main map. I have 7k hours and 15k+ raids on the map. Without the high tier loot there really isn't any incentive for people to go there besides their quests. I don't want to loot myself, I just want the pvp that comes with it. I already hit 100M liquid and got kappa so looting is honestly just a chore for me. I just go in for 15 minutes and hope someone comes to resort before I extract. 

My trio has found close to 35 ledx this wipe in around 500 raids. Some of them have been in a random stash or duffle that we hit as we went to extract."
nighteeeeey,i agree. make this top post of the year.
Shooter503,"I remember the days of being able to find cases and shit in marked rooms and the rush you get when you find one and have to battle your way to extract. That shit is what made me love this game initially. 

Nowadays this game is hard to enjoy because it's just a constant dick punch from BSG and cheaters. The number of negative changes they have made to combat RMT far outweigh the positive ones. Marked rooms just straight up aren't worth looting anymore. 

I went through 10 charges of a dorms marked key at the very start of this wipe and the most valuable thing I found was 1 RSASS (yay Gunsmithing task!), aside from that every other time I open any marked room it's usually just some random shitty bullets and a random shitty shotgun or AK or something. 

At the VERY LEAST the guns that spawn in marked rooms should be decked the fuck out and ammo that spawns in marked rooms should be top-tier, otherwise, it's just a waste of time to go anywhere near a marked room."
nightlie30,RMT?
xPizzaKittyx,"Ive noticed alot of the high traffic areas from back in the day are just ghost towns now. Dorms is absolutely worthless unless you need a quest, the pawn buildings on reserve are abandonded i dont think ive seen anyone on that half of the map this entire wipe, emercom checkpoint is now the busiest area on interchange, factory office area is always quiet because anyone there is either on the office kill quest, or risking their entire run for a flash drive."
NSTY_KNOCKER,If the cheaters could have the loot back some of them would stop killing players
HarukiMisora,Rare ground spawns and caches are garbage. Won't even bother buying marked keys when i can get better loot out of a safe and 2 cabinets.
gearabuser,"My friends and I agree. FIR isn't working well. Once you find juicy loot or get that quest objective done, no more playing the game the same. It's all about running from any other players you get wind of. It fits the lore of ""escaping from tarkov"" but it sure isn't nearly as fun as being able to engage with other players. This makes questing an absolute chore that I avoid as well. Luckily they removed impact nades from traders and the Bitcoin farm is meh, so I don't have reason to level my hideout now. I also miss the loot rooms for all the reasons you lined out. Agree 100%. I used to run reserve, get some decent loot in my butt, then run off to pvp for some fun. Now it's 100% rat and avoid all other players all of the time on that map. To be honest, we camped before but now it's pretty much all we do. It's kind of more efficient to just let other people perform the chore of finding all the loot then just having them bring it to us."
Opaldes,I use the Mosin all day looking like a hobo who lives in a IDEA trash container.
Jlindahl93,No high in Tarkov has come close to how it was to find a weapons case in marked room. Bring back sicc cases in marked rooms again and I’d log back in.
Volomon,Is that what happen?  Man I was making some serious great hauls on streets then it was like a switch flipped and now you can't find anything good.
Solaratov,"I agree, but unless a high profile streamer picks this up and runs with it BSG will do nothing."
hazzap913,Considering they haven’t done anything to counter hacking what’s the point in nerfing loot cos they’re gonna get it anyways
_Nightdude_,"All these changes have done is to make the game more tedious for the average player. 
The RMTing douchebags are still sitting on the flea three days into the wipe selling 35 packs of ledx with their 65 flea rating. 
You made a great point about PVP and loot zones so I won't expand on that, but I want to add that they should bring back loot in containers as well. I miss looting a rig at giving tree or old gas and hoping a red key card would be inside of it. 
Marked rooms have been neutered for no reason. I always felt it was bullshit that there was a chance you'd get an almost empty marked room but making that the norm? Come on. Just make the keys rarer or something. Also, making those viable again would create more opportunities for PVP fights since people will be duking it out over who gets the marked room loot. 

Two slots on the flea... just why? I've had EOD since my second wipe, so I can't imagine what kind of torture it must be to sell shit on a normal account. I'd probably only sell the most valuable things on the flea and sell everything else to traders. Hell, that's what I do now, except usually my two flea slots are taken up by the stuff I craft to make money with. Meanwhile our RMT friends that have been hindered so much by these changes have 5 slots in week one of the wipe anyway. 
Having 3 slots to start with never felt OP. Having 4 slots at 10 rating never felt like it was too much. Why can't we just go back?

And while we're talking about changes that need to be reverted, can we talk about Bitcoin? I know that one is a dangerous topic on this subreddit because half the people here hate the idea of everyone just getting passive safe income... but I'd argue if the mechanic exists in the game and if you have to work as hard to get it as you have to, then it should have a prapor payoff.

I'm the last person to argue that getting three bitcoins each worth 960k roubles every 15 hours wasn't fucking stupid. It definitely was way too much and turned the looting part of raids into an afterthought the moment you got your 50graphic cards. 
But since then we've made building bitcoin 3 astronomically more expensive, it takes 5 years to generate a single bitcoin with a max level farm and they're worth barely half of a quick factory scav run.
This stuff needs to be dialed back somewhere imo. Make them generate faster again or make building the farm cheaper or just swallow that pill and finally get rid of the real world tie to bitcoins prices. 
Or get rid of it entirely."
Aceylah,"Yeah I agree there's nothing to fight over, interchange used to actually be playable. Now it's just everyone ratting around in the dark looting duffel bags. The fights in over reserve drop down were sick. Always people going for customs marked room. The risk/reward of high tier loot zones was the best part of the game."
Kilo-Nein,"I make no money on PMC runs this wipe. Over 3500 hours and it's just not worth it even running PMC outside of quests.

All high tier loot is either gone or gets swiped by cheaters.

All player gear I find has to be vendored.

If I find good gear, even one player's gear labors me down to a crawl.

Any valuable gear I lose is just gone.

If I die, all of my ammo is gone (and the good shit costs $)

Any good ammo is impossible to find or gated behind multiple hideout upgrades.

Insurance prices are insane.

The fights just aren't even worth it anymore. That aspect of the game, and the hype of the fights and profitability of them are just gone. It has absolutely killed a core mechanic of the game."
UniqueUserII,"I agree, however items FIR should not be able to put in pouch, this makes it so the first person or closest spawn doesn't get the good loot and hide it away. If anything purple items are fine in pouch for money runs, but people putting ledx/GPUs ect in pouch makes the game less intense knowing your loot is secure before extracting or even seeing anyone."
osoichan,the changes made it so that cheaters loot everything cause they don't care where it's at  and legit players have to look around more.
cloud715,I think that foe the cost of keycards besides black is insane considering the heavy nerfs to all the rooms besides yellow
Jonhazen,"Cheaters are already worse than ever. This will only encourage it more. I agree with the premise of your point but the thing that mainly needs to be stopped is cheating.

This game studio has over a hundred employees, and they've only come this far in so many years. At this point, we should have a system similar to CSGO's ""overwatch"" or something. Because the way the game is going now, player legitimacy wise, is down the drain."
EokaBeamer,Can you make your point without writing a long ass essay? You lost me after the title.
