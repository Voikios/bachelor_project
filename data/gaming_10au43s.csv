threerobots,"I always thought it would be cool to have a Pok√© Ball that would take on the appearance of the caught Pok√©mon so you would know which ball has which Pok√©mon. So I designed and rendered 151 Pok√© Balls of the Kanto Pok√©mon..  
  
You can check out all of them here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib5hhzLw\_Qk"
TooManyZeroes,Nobody's gonna mention the Machamp goatsie?
GodofAeons,"Game freak, get this man a job please? 

Joking, this shows way too much passion for the game for it to be implemented. Great job OP, it looks beautiful"
JKSHulenburg,......... Now I want to 3d print all of these and do a wall display
JanJaapen,Voltorb was an easy one I expect
AsianPotato77,"I really like the lickitung ball

now how would a alolan exeggcutor ball work lol"
olivebars,Something something NFT
Jolt_91,"I gotta be honest. I absolutely adore them, but I don't like when they got pointy stuff on them. I don't mind round things like on the Tangela one.

Otherwise, fantastic work!"
samfringo,I love the scratches on them
BunnySSD,It's like Bakugan
Meechgalhuquot,"Porygon is honestly one of my favorites haha, the Poliwhirl one is also pretty great"
zackdaniels93,"Nice modelling and rendering, Blender? Or a design suite like Autodesk?"
The_Mutant_Platypus,I want the Gengar ball so badly.
iforgetmypassword13,they look like destiny 2 ghost shell.
ggezcasso,What is kanto pokemon? The first 151(2)?
The_Poop_Shooter,The Destiny - Pokemon crossover I never knew I needed.
Otherwise_Storm7234,"It's looks absolutely amazing 
I would love to see a Charizard one"
Alkalineking,"These are amazing, can't wait to see Electrode"
AetherLionn,"Man, Kanto region had less pokemon than I remember."
Torterror389,TIL there are only 7 Kanto Pok√©mon
steven09763,I counted 6 tops
SuperSaiyanZubat,"This is some awesome work! The scuffs and dings are a nice touch, but I gotta say. Out there somewhere (maybe) some kids favorite Pok√©mon is Kakuna, and they‚Äôre gonna be bummed lol"
JDpoZ,"Very cool!

If you don't mind a fellow artist's unsolicited critique, I have only a few very minor thoughts...

1. Material properties. All your Pok√©balls have a uniform-seeming material nature to them. Uniform reflectivity, uniform specularity, etc. Instead of using a uniformly reflective chrome-like metal shader across every face and then shifting the color of each section, try using different material properties. Maybe an [anisotropic metal shader](https://www.blenderguru.com/tutorials/an-introduction-to-anisotropic-shading) for the machined metal button you put on the equatorial face like how this one a person built in [real-life](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HayiZa_hIW4/hqdefault.jpg). Maybe a more matte finish for the black centerline section like that ball, too. You could even go crazy and a [bass-pro boat / bowling ball glitter subsurface finish like this guy did](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/002/196/571/medium/akira-akatsu-4693397.jpg?1458564527).

2. More thoughtful ""[imperfections](https://youtu.be/6sVyUd5kUDw)"" and ""weathering."" It looks like you have sort of a universal ""scratch"" map being applied across the surface details / normal map for each ball. Take a look at something like a [roughly treated cell-phone case](https://external-preview.redd.it/KiY0e361UvyQKrvHkhs3MV2ipbnaRnakFa3VR6_gypA.jpg?auto=webp&s=59b8b8a9fc3a87047e7fde74e7c919eac0db6875), or an [older gun](https://www.coltforum.com/attachments/colt-1905-left-jpg.358105/), or an up-close photograph of an [arcade joystick](https://i.redd.it/lzn9d83kyt741.jpg). Instead, the weathering would be more apparent on surface edges that came in contact with abrasives like sand or oily surfaces such as a hand, or was thrown against harder surfaces like a tree or dirt that might have scratched it in specific places. Usually [exposed sharper edges](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/046/320/591/medium/cedric-cohen-tbrender-2.jpg?1644847316) are subject to more apparent weathering. Don't go overboard though. Too much weathering looks [silly](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/110/993/medium/adam-fatka-pokeball-image.jpg?1440309423) or [visually unappealing](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/003/710/237/medium/gary-pierre-paul-14188111-10202350771928585-7844099218360466026-o-02.jpg?1476705058) or even sometimes just plain [gross](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/038/570/289/medium/marc-hummel-pokeball-dirty.jpg?1623437357).

3. Last but not least - give us a nice turnaround video... either orbit a virtual camera around it while keeping the environment map static, or spin the ball itself on its axis while keeping the camera either still or in a very slight slow orbit.

I look forward to seeing you some-day outdo something like the [work](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/oAlAw4) of Anthony Brun or Senior Character Artist at Blizzard like [Rakan Khamash](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/039/223/141/medium/-halflife-poki-final-1.jpg?1625285565)!"
BigiticusDegenticus,It looks like a bakugan
N_DaggerDevochka84,Awesome!!!
No_Duty1273,Looks great!
J3mSton3,These are amazing! Love how you added the scratches to them as well.
GOLDVILLAIN,"look like they got some weight to them, i like it"
Bijlsma,"I subbed to you on Youtube, really love the work you put into all of these! As another user stated, the scratches on them really seals the deal for authenticity!"
MrHanslaX,I basically did this sort of thing when i played the games. Try to colour match the pokemon and type of ball.
baconboy957,"So if anyone knows how to 3d print these....

I have money. Not a lot.. but it can be yours"
AdvancedCharcoal,Do you sell them or plan to?
thRINZIman,"It's honestly really cool that the wear/tear scratches are different. Makes them look briefly plucked out of context, only to be put back in the moment we're done observing them -- as opposed to isolated exhibition items."
Ianilla1,"This is wildly impressive, fantastic job"
Ehrre,"This is actually a super good idea that should be implemented into the show/games.  

Having your team displayed on your Hip in little custom balls would be so cool."
BurgooKing,The gengar and blastoise ones go especially hard
BurgooKing,"Did you make this in blender? Zbrush? I gotta know, beautiful work man"
Linkachuap,Shiny variation's when? /j
aboubou22,Gotta 3Dprint 'em all !
NaesPa,Was that yellow ball a Drowzee? That and gengar were my fav's.
frankp0013,"These are fucking incredible, great job. Tried picking a few favorites but honestly lost count. Side note, would‚Äôve been hilarious if the Ditto ball was just a regular Pok√©ball!"
Traditional_Door6648,Take my money
DANleDINOSAUR,I counted 7
SiriusBaaz,I like the idea but that tangela ball was surprisingly gross
Pyro1934,Looks awesome
danikzjcv,Gengar balls go hard
,The battle scars will always be my favorite part.
enderfx,"Make a deal with somebody to manufacture them in a metal material, with good weight and that shiny look.

Sell them in/from a country that does not give a fuck about copyright laws.

Sell them to me for $50 each.

Profit!!"
TheGaz,"Bullshit, that was like 6 balls at most"
warcraftselblatt,"cubone and ghastly were my favorite. Well done.

My only small disappointment was that the toxic symbols on koffing and weezing didnt make it onto the balls."
Cthulumon_,Love it!
acidwxlf,"I love the concept, I love the backstory you came up with, and I haven't gotten through the whole video yet but I am obsessed with the overbite that the Charizard ball has. Awesome work!"
That_One_Guy2945,"Alright, tell me where I can buy that Genghar one, please."

manonthemoonrocks,Very cool
Firesteel3,I need to see voltorbs.
pajamasx,You should make a video of all of them with the Pokerap song
thanyou,"Cool idea! People are never satisfied, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be with what you've already made."
IdealIdeas,I like how the scratch marks dont change except for the drowzee ball
Kurdt234,"Oh my God I love the details, the little bit of wear on each one is amazing."
BlueSonicDude,Even the glitch ones?
bhive-,I love the gengar one
OptimistPrime15,Those scratches make them pop
Kitakitakita,I like how you started with Voltorb to dodge all the comments like this one
Mac8503,How much?
IAmReinvented,Not a pokemon fan but damn this is really cool. Good work OP :)
d0rf47,my gf says where is the jigglypuff!
ialwayschoosepsyduck,My boi Psyduck will be pleased with his new home
your_namelover,How you made them..?

No-Performer-7450,Nice man
KONG-0,Looks amazing
g-gourab,Cool ...üíô
Kindly_Leg_7976,Awesome stuff! Keep 'em coming!
harrylarry6,Finally now I know what is in each pokeball instead of getting them mixed up
SheepDogCO,I‚Äôm printing a pokeball as I type this.
CaptainKurls,"Ninetales was my favorite growing up, the ball design for it is awesome!"
Mr_Maik,Hey OP is there any way you could share the Stl files of those? I'd love to 3D Print some of them.
Jet-black101,Sick
JPyroRaptor,Plz make noivern next
PotatoPieGaming,The slight surface imperfections make them look so realistic
Ryza_J,This is awesome! üëç
mystaninja,Would have been hilarious if you presented this like u/rightcoastguy's inventions.
Ioauis,Impressive
ChaosOpen,"Kanto pokemon a.k.a. the only pokemon that matter. Downvote me all you want, I don't care."
Halaster,Just putting my request in with others for you to release STL files for these so they can be 3D printed.
That-Chard1851,Dude I'd so get the blastoise ball. That's sick af

Narrow-Battle216,Go NFT ! üòÑ
Khaoz_Se7en,What an idiot (there‚Äôs already the regular pokeball for every Pok√©mon)
