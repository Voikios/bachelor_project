some_random_nonsense,"Escape pods in POI are in fixed locations. Usually only 1 per a station, but terraformer has two in mirror locations and spaceport has two side by side.

Good loot is behind locked doors. Bring at least 2 lockpicks with you. Look for locked doors, yellow lid boxes, and safes. Also keep an eye out for military boxes, ammo tins, and lockers. Depending on where the container is it can spawn really good loot like supply drops and bags.

Black bags always spawn money. Like 100k. Theres at least 1 per level and some have as many as 5.

There are also hidden stashes, again at least 1 per a level and as many as 5, that have random loot in them. Anything from litteral trash to gold ingots and nukes.

The Rust-Fuck-It special is the luger and vest that spawns in the rust bucket. Its free and so are the 4 fire extinguishers and captain's key card. Take all of them out of raid and it should jet you about $4k. Good if you ever run out of money.

Key cards can also tell you who you killed and are worth about 1k. If you're collecting trophies theyre good loot but pretty low mid-tier for price.

Tool kits, reinforced metal, and scrap metal are premium loot for crafting grab em when you can. 

Leather straps, scrap cloth, disinfectant, and gears are basic crafting items and its always good to collect 1 stack in a raid if you can.

Keep a stack or 2 of cables, you need them for inventory upgrades, but not more than that. 

Look through the crafting menu and decide what you want to buy ahead of time. Points are based on level and limited. Heals are important, as are weapon mods, inventory upgrades, and bigger ammo.

FABRIC IS KING. I would DIE for FABRIC. I would MURDER you, your kin, and your dog for a SINGLE scrap of the pure G R E E N gold. Its it used for the best chest armor which has awesome storage and high defense. 

9mm<.32<10mm<.45 for smg and pistol damage. There some outliers but mostly follows this trend.

Big ammo is king. When you unlock the svt give it a try. Any ammo boxes, or large Gunpowder you find, hoard. 

The Zero to Hero quest requires certain items. Id check the wiki and make a shopping list of shit to hold on too.

Hang on to blow torches they get you into vaults. 

For extra space, buy a scout ship. They come with a small 18 slot storage, which you can acces in raid near the airlock, which is great to hold onto your extra stuff. Like those ZtH items I just mentioned. Slap some rockets on it and if you accidently take a stroqge ship with you in raid, at least you can take a few fuckers down with you when you get swarmed.

Sounds has about a 30 foot aoe where running and walking disappears after. Dont be afraid to sprint around a bit here and there, but watch out you might run into a rat. Its a balance.

If you get shot down and escape your attacker you can re-enter your ship and repair it with fire extinguishers. This will let you get back into a raid. You can also steal someone else's ship like this and get into raid.

Watch our for special POI's. The merchant ship has a pseudo vault with TWO black bags in it for lots of money. The capital ship has 5 commandos and a military box spawn which will give you high tier gear, but not much else. The Red Baron will fuck your shit up. Just aviod him for now. He will shoot your pod down too.

Clear put any missile turrets near POI's. They can shoot your pod down. 

Its takes 1 minute and 30 seconds to active the pod and boost out the extract. Watch that timer. Be at the pod or airlock at 2 minutes or You. Are. FUCKED. No ""if"", ""and"", or ""buts"" about it.

Middle mouse button is ""use"" and you can quickly heal that way. Use meds>food>painkillers and you can stack all the heal type to quickly recover like a poor man's first aid kit. I like to use a medium med, can, and asprin as a poor panic heal.

Most importantly remember none of this matter. The goal is fun and if sniffing trash bins and collecting a mountain of gears is your fun then do it that way. If your worried about loosing gear, well one day you can find it again, just use cools things and don't sweat the losses.

And most importantly, have fun :)"
verynerdythings,This is a great library
terrencethetomato,"Don't peek the same angle twice in a fight, you will lose.

If you're losing a fight, run until your stamina is almost gone, and try to hold a corner, most players will chase mindlessly, and if they don't you have time to heal 

Don't be afraid to carry lots of meds or cheap food - you can always drop them and they'll most likely save your life. 

Fabric is gold, never skip picking it up."
Vahagn323,"1. Right click to aim and left click to shoot.
2. When looting items make sure you don't run out of inventory space, otherwise you cannot loot more items.
3. Kill every NPC you encounter, as a treat.
4. Middle mouse button while hovering over a healing item to use it instantly.
5. CTRL makes you crouch, centering your head and torso which might make you more susceptible to headshots/definite body shots, but it stabilizes your aim by a great deal. Use it when time permits and when you have a good shot from range, or to bamboozle someone into missing their shots as crouching is near instant.
6. Don't get too greedy, if you're in a raid for 5-8 minutes and have a full bag of a few goodies and you picked up a gun, then just extract to reap the benefits. It's a marathon at first, you can make it into a sprint once you've ascended into chadhood.
7. Each map has a set number of airlocks and one drop-pod location, remember where you airlock is to get back to your ship or where the drop-pods are located so you can dip out of the station you are on.
8. Similar to 7, map knowledge is a huge factor for success in this game, take your time getting to know the different maps.
9. Headshots are king, if you can reliably land body shots that works too but there's a 3x multiplier for headers, get at least one with some body shots and you will win a lot of fights.
10. Limit the noise you make or be aware of it, sound travels far and people with headsets (the best way to play) will sniff you out with their ears.
11. Have fun, I'd like to think I'm pretty good at this game after about \~300 hours of play time since Early Access, but I used to suck and spend my days ratting around. You'll get used to the gameplay and get better at it as long as you're enjoying yourself."

sw4mpy_1,Don't die
godspark533,"* .300 ammo is rare, 7.62 also.
* You have to spend level-up tokens to unlock available crafts.
* You always get a new Rustbucket ship when you die.
* Use a ship to dock and enter big locations, escape pods for ships."
Wavy_Beam,Don't be afraid to lose loot!
Paydie,You can heal yourself while entering a pod
WTG_Cannon,"Getting the first few levels (at least for me)  was difficult,  you'll  need to learn the gunplay and how the maps are first before much progress can be gained. 

Do yourself a favor and build up resources ASAP, anything and everything you can get your hands on.  I recommend for basic resources get metal and synthetic scrap,  disinfectant and then other things. You use these the most for basically all kinds of useful items; sack bags,  bandages and lockpicks as an example. 

I highly recommend if you find ANY of the following to GTFO ASAP:  toolkits,  fabric (as mentioned above), warbonds, supply drops, jewelry boxes and any kind of crate. 

You start with 65k, but the stuff in the shop you can get is pretty much trash.  Save up what you can to unlock crafting recipes and weapons.

I HIGHLY recommend not taking anything for a good while (aka the rust-fuck-it kit) and learn maps (specifically the asteroid mine and the spaceport,  they have easier AI and a good deal of small loot spawns to practice and get basics.)

Also take a sack bag with you whenever you can (I'd recommend as your first unlock tbh) it's the best way to get synthetic scrap really early on (just collect junk scrap,  make the bags and then scrap the bags for a chance to get synthetic)  and early way to get resources. 

Do the missions when you can,  especially if it's for space mines or radar tower. Easy money and leveling for better trader gear."
Uselesswizardmini,"Favor right hand peaks. The line of sight and bullets in this game are from the right side of your Marauder.

Left hand peaks expose much more or your body than right hand so you're pretty much not peaking on the left. You're putting the majority of your body into the open."
Purple_W1TCH,"Playing on EU Servers (From France)  


DM if you'd like to team up and run around like a headless-chicken, it's pretty good!"
FatboiCleff,"Treat it less like Hunt, more like Tarkov. Move carefully and check your corners. Don't pick a fight with people who easily outgear you. And remember, AI seems easy, but there is a chance they outnumber you, and if not, shots will compromise your position. It is still part of the tactical looter shooter genre. And it is unforgiving."
ihadthejewfro,Don't run unless you have to and follow the red lights to the escape pod.
OpinionOK_IgnorantNo,Yeah watch out for squiddy that bitch a hacker
jim_the-gun-guy,If playing solo. Stay stealthy til you got the mechanics of the game down. After that and your doing well for yourself. Always have an escape plan and shoot everything.
Exo-Novaa,"Don't spend all your money, be pretty frugal at the start cause 65000 isn't all that much. There are ways to recover from losing everything in your inventory but it helps if you have at least 10k cause then you can buy a little gear to get by."
SouthernWishbone7177,Tips for a newcomer? Do not trust anyone in the marauders discord if you’re looking for a team. I’m down to team or help any newcomer though. My discord is Poltergeist#8596 dm me and I’ll be down to play.
