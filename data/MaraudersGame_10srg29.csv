Farcus_Prime,"For those curious on why this happened, decals are projected onto surfaces. You can change sorting settings to determine if a decal shows up onto or behind something. That is why the stripes are under the sandbags. 

By default, unreal engine checks a box that says ""receives decals"" for all actors, so in this case, the SAS model must have that checkbox checked. That also means it is a nice one click fix."
