The images can look the same. Only when the game is running, is when FPS comes into play.

Single images cannot display FPS. They can display graphic quality.

Once you get to 60 fps or higher. There is a certain smoothness you do experience. When you drop below that. 

You can tell. Like when you have latency, encounter a bug, or have world generation occurring.

Gamers can and still do have fun with lower framerate games (I remember PS1 games being very choppy compared to my PC at the time). Not everyone is as sensitive to differences in framerate either; I definitely can but have friends who cannot unless performance is incredibly terrible.

Nevertheless, it's inevitable that pro-30fps gamers will eventually come around and appreciate higher framerates. There were waves of this when Playstation first rolled out Performance Mode and it wow'ed unenlightened gamers."

Money will buy you the following: freedom, control over the entire legal system, your very life depending on what medical problems you have, friends/sex/wife, comfort and security, a ""get out of jail free"" card (not valid if you fuck over OTHER oligarchs), and with enough of it...it's very easy to own a human being for whatever reason you need them for.

If your basic needs are met and more money would just mean more disposable income for toys and wants then I agree it does not make you happy in the long run.

More stuff does not buy you happiness. Trust me, the more shit you own the more it owns you.

By this I mean you fear loss of material goods but each new material acquisition brings you a marginal amount of happiness if any at all.

It is never as good when you only owned a couple of things but still you made do with so little and then you upgraded. Yes, newer stuff is exciting but after a while material goods hit a saturation point and more stuff becomes a lateral move in terms of being happier.

I’m not even rich and yet as middle class I already feel this way.

**But on the other hand**, more financial mobility and having your basic needs met DOES bring happiness and satisfaction.

Just being able to go to the store and buying food and not worrying about insufficient funds or being able to pay rent, utilities and not needing to worry how you’ll get by next month and beinf able to save.

That DOES mean happiness to the most destitute."

And having enough money if someone falls ill for a few weeks and you can pay all the bills. 

Enough money to buy a new pair of good shoes and seasonal clothing for the child.

The good brand of nappies instead of searching around for a better deal while you buy the ones that are a bit worse but still okay enough.

And knowing there's enough for a modest vacation of 7-10 days that could take place a bit less than a year in the future.

And, finally, being able to NOT work for 2 weeks while you decompress, fix that effin' door handle that's too stiff and noisy, and find a handyman with an angle-grinder to fix something else.

All it's meant to say is that there's an upper bound for when more money doesn't improve you life in any significant way and there are certain things you can never buy with money; Real friendship, real love and a real sense of happiness. No one's debating that financial strain doesn't affect your well being with all the stress that comes with it. But removing that stress doesn't make you  automatically happy, it only gives you a better prerequisite to achieve some kind of happiness.

The fact that not only has this shit happened to Halo but multiple other popular series (Star Wars, Witcher, etc.) is sickening.

They didn't rewrite the story. They didn't change the characters personality. They didn't try to shoehorn some stupid political message in there (outside of any message already present in the game). The literally just took the source material and made it a live show. That's it.

Even though I knew what was coming it hit just as hard in the show. The scenes and characters all done extremely well and the acting is too notch, I wasn't expecting a true to source show and I've grown to distrust writers from tweaking things without reason (looking at you Netflix).

The Pokemon using Swagger does exactly that, they act like they have this swagger like ""Hey I'm better than you, no way you can hit me"" (especially since swagger is naturally learned by a lot of dark Pokemon, so think of it like an underhanded tactic) and the opposing pokemon gets super pissed off, increasing it's attack power, but also putting it into a blind rage (which is a type of confusion imo).

Now I know why this happens,,10cpo81,63531,506,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10cpo81/now_i_know_why_this_happens/,Gangsir,"I've always thought this move was... very bad. Like okay, you raise their attack by 2 levels, and confuse them. 

Self damage from confusion IS based on attack, so if the confusion coin flip succeeds (and it literally is a coin flip up to gen 6, 50% chance, down to 1/3rd chance in gen 7 onward, making this move worse) they *will* take more damage... But confusion self damage even with that is usually like 10% hp or so.

Also, confusion is a volatile status effect meaning it cures itself after some time... but the attack bonus doesn't go away.

If the pokemon doesn't die while confused from itself or others... you now have a +2 attack-ed pokemon that's gonna proceed to delete your team (provided they're a phys attacker like machoke is). You can use swagger again to re-confuse them... but now they're +4 attack-ed. Fail the coinflip? Get one-shot.

This gets even worse if they cure the confusion immediately via item. Or if they baton pass, which cures the confuse but hands off the attack bonus to the next pokemon.

I just do not see the value of this move unless you're just full on gambling that you can use it like a really shitty protect to avoid some big move they're cooking up, and kill them the next turn (or if they're some psychic type special attacker and the attk bonus doesn't matter)."

I worked in a pretty small store in a mall and most of the time I worked alone, the evenings were usually chill and few customers stopped by. 

One such evening in December an old lady, I'd say like 75-80 years old, came by the store and looked around in the Nintendo Wii section. I asked her if she needed any help, and she answered that she was looking for ""Zelda, Skyward Sword"". I was kind of impressed that she named the actual title of the game, considering she was an old Norwegian lady with (what I assumed was) limited exposure to such media. I asked something along the lines of ""Is it a gift for someone?"" and she answered, ""Oh no, I've been looking forward to this one for years!"" with a big smile."

I feel like video games are massively stigmatized by seniors to the point where seeing someone over 70 enjoying them is like a unicorn sighting. Such a shame.

I am still amazed at what Atari did with 2kb cartridges (I think in the end they managed 32kb) and it had128 BYTES of ram!
It could only address 4kb at a time. If I remember correctly they used a technique called 'bank switching' to display sprites beyond its capabilities by making the sprites flicker but it permitted a game to be played.
Again, if memory serves me right. A programmer from Atari called David Crane and another I can't remember the name of left Atari and set up Activision. They used larger cartridge memory which forced Atari to do the same as the Activision games always 'looked' better."

Easy peasy. You don't have to pick every asshole option to be renegade. You can still pick some paragon options, especially when the renegade is unnecessarily harsh or mean-spirited. Most renegade options, in my experience, were giving people the harsh truth or doing something badass but dangerous in a fight. 

Much of the renegade just plays out like a military version of doctor house (somewhat of a dick but also doing what's necessary to get the job done), not a roving maniac. People are just doing it wrong here, it seems, or they've just never done it. They've simplified it to you have to be 100% blue to be paragon or 100% red to be renegade. Also, the renegade options may be harsher, but they're also way more badass."

In Stardew Valley, certain objectives will show up where someone says ""I'm looking for [ITEM] does someone have it?""

There are multiple responses for each, and they change by the season. So Haley's request usually goes like this:

""FOR GIRLS ONLY: psst... I need [ITEM]... you know what it's for. Keep it secret, okay?"" - Haley

So sometimes it's a gem, sometimes it's flowers... Often it's a vegetable of some kind you can grow on your farm.

So yes, sometimes it seems a bit dirty."

An item discovery help wanted randomly rolled from a villager that happened to be female, and it happened to roll *eggplant* for the item requested. It could have just as easily rolled *corn* or *mayonnaise* and it would still be funny. Given that there are four types of mayo in this game for some reason, an NPC randomly having an urgent need for mayo is probably the most common rude sounding objective."

It has some defects of design tho. I'd say that the main problem is that in some moments you need to constantly switch weapon to adjust to every kind of enemy. When you're fighting multiple people it becomes a problem, it's not fluid and intuitive. I think you could have been a little less rigid on this, and make enemies vulnerable to more (or all) guns. Maybe take less damage, but still vulnerable. As it is now, it makes some sections very frustrating. I've seen this is the most common criticism"

after getting a mobile phone i ended up having headaches when i play for a while so it was better with a nintendo switch because it didn't seem to have that effect. if i want to play a mobile game i use bluestacks recently, i'm impressed with the new updates. but if i wanna go outside i always have my switch with me"

It's not really a reflection of the quality of any two games in particular. Likewise one doesn't cost $70 due to a higher production value, it's likely due to coming out 6 months later. This is the pricing direction many companies want to go.

Also never budging on that price with sales etc. The PS4 released about 4 years before the switch. And yet the switch can't even run any recent versions of Skyrim. I was told by a friend that it's an older version so it's full of bugs and glitches. But meanwhile Bethesda and Nintendo are like ""it's Skyrim on the go!"" But failed to mention it's not even optimized for switch. Just barely running an older version that doesn't work. 

Now let's look back at playstation, within months the top AAA games go on sale. Usually like 10-15% if they're really new. But eventually you can get games like Spider-Man for $20 or less if you wait. Never the case for Nintendo."

Oblivion was great. Open world games are my favorite and I’ve always been a a fan of fantasy games. I got Skyrim the day it came out and remember being obsessed with it. I’ve beaten it as every race and in every different way possible at least 3 times each. Throughout the years I will randomly start a new play through. Once I got a PC I started modding and since then I’ve beaten at least 10 times. I just recently started a new modded play through. I love to mod the game to be extremely difficult. I use mods to change the perk trees and get 3 times as many perk points to try and keep the game balanced. I only play on legendary. The character I play now is always a huge jacked AF Breton that is a jack of all trades. The game is so hard that I have to start out in a dungeon going stealthy with a bow. Then once I get detected I switch to magic then once the enemy gets closer I switch to magic with sword and after I get hit a few times I switch to sword and shield. I will also hot key my armor and start out with light armor for stealth then switch to heavy armor once the enemy closes the difference. I also modded the perk trees for werewolves, vampire lord, and vampire now has its own perk trees. I add the ability to fly as vampire lord. My character ends up being a super powerful werewolf, vampire lord, and vampire all at the same time. Even with my character being extremely badass I still die after 1 or 2 hits from almost any enemy. It’s really fun. I have to be extremely OP and use everything at my disposal and even then I’ll die 10+ times just from one battle."

Not because of nostalgia, but because many of the games released during this era developed games with the idea of 'easy to get into, hard to master' template of arcade games. The most cinematic game I can think of back then was the God of War and Halo series, and GoW still provided a modern day take in beat-em ups (along with Yakuza). Halo was fun as hell as well. JRPGs were always cinematic though. 

It also felt like most of the games during this era were developed around the gameplay and not around the story, no progression system except for RPGs, cool extra modes (create a map in Timesplitters for instance, dunk contest in NBA Live), arcade-like gameplay (SSX, Tony Hawk, etc.).

Lastly, I don't know but games released during this era felt complete and had a lot of replayability. Fighting games, JRPGs, Sports, Adventure, and Platformers were really at their peak during this time."

I played Pokémon yellow in the way there. When we drove home at the end of the day it was night so it was too dark to play it. As we were pulling into our neighborhood, I pulled it out of the pouch on the back of the front seat. I accidentally tapped the A and B buttons at the same time making the click sound. My mom started yelling at me to put my seatbelt back on, lol."

My Ellie cosplay from The Last of Us,,10eauls,43626,1052,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10eauls/my_ellie_cosplay_from_the_last_of_us/,Rizenstrom,"I really wish cosplayers included links to raw, unedited photos as well. It's really hard to appreciate a cosplay when you can't tell how much of it is even real anymore.

I'm not going to be one of those ""this isn't cosplay"" people, it quite obviously is, but is the cosplay doing the heavy lifting or the editing? I can't tell. I want to be impressed by the cosplay but I just can't be when I don't even know how much of it is real.

Like that bite mark, the bruising, blood - makeup? Or editing? What about the weathering on the shirt/ pants? The face shape - makeup illusion or editing?

Edit: 

Hopefully this helps people understand better: there are two ways to appreciate art. As a whole and as individual components. Think of it like any other art form. 

If I draw something there's the drawing as a whole and then there's individual components. Linework, shading, color, perspective, proportions, etc. I can have really good linework and shading but a bad sense of perspective or proportions. 

Now I *could* load that up into photoshop and edit out the flaws and upload that drawing and get a bunch of upvotes but that would be a bit disingenuous, no? 

You can appreciate the *photo* but it's hard to appreciate the *cosplay* when you can't tell where it ends and editing begins. 

There's no more room for criticism or improvement, or ability to appreciate and compliment what was well done, when something is heavily edited."

Quarter after quarter it continues to do poorly. Its future is doomed. As there will be no place for middlemen players like this for where the video game sales landscape is inevitably going (direct, streaming, digital, and maybe shrinking amounts of hardcopy sales sold through online vendors where there is loads of competition). Attempts to re-invent itself have failed. If it weren't for the meme stock craze and gme cult that sprang up, we'd be talking about this company like Bed Bath and Beyond right now.

The price was more than normal. 80 euro or 70 dollars. Clearly money grabbing off of the hype.

The graphics are not ""next gen"" as claimed. There are many scenes that look like it is an 8 year old game.

Poor optimization, the minimum requirements are ridiculously high compared to how the game looks.

The story is not that great. It kind of feels like it was written by ChatGPT. Same with the dialogue.

The main character is kind of cringe when she talks. There's also a lot of pointless dialogue.

The combat is meh.

The ""open world"" is about as alive as sonic frontiers.

The gameplay itself is pretty good... It isn't a bad game, but it certainly is not worth the money. I also think people are being hyper-critical because of the advertising around this game. They claimed it was a next-gen AAA title, when it wasn't."

He later worked on a project to try making a chocobo fighting game where 2 chocobo riders would battle each other.

C4 onto an ATV drive it towards a tank or group of enemies and jump off right before and boom!!! :)

Sniping someone out of a jet or heli was SOOO satisfying!

Speaking of sniping, it was the best!! Hitting that long range shot or winning a sniper battle with someone on the boat in the middle of nowhere or on a high ass tower was so satisfying!

It's basically a whole flight simulation with fighter jets that have fully functional weapons/radar/radios you name it. They have everything from WWII to Korean War to Vietnam to about 2000ish (anything newer is still classified and the devs take pride in making a true to life simulation). You can fly an F18 and recreate this mission if you like.

You can play PVE, PVP, Singleplayer, and even in VR!! [Check out this video](https://youtu.be/OLh02USKkHY) for a small taste of what it's like. Then join us on /r/hoggit if you want to learn more!"

My self-made Aloy cosplay,,10gynkf,37374,586,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10gynkf/my_selfmade_aloy_cosplay/,thefabulousbri,"A lot of people are being really awful about editing as if it isn't a skill. I am assuming with either editing or some very clever use of highlighter/makeup the face looks amazingly cgi-ed. It is definitely possible to get that look with makeup, getting the lighting right and making the character a little shiny will do that.

With that said, if it is editing, that is also really cool. A lot of work goes into a cosplay that basic editing can't do. Also editing takes work and skill so if you want to edit, do it. 

This is a phenomenal cosplay, fuck all the haters shitting on editing as if they could do the cosplay better. I thought this was a screenshot from the game, it looks so good.

TL;DR If you have issues with editing images to look more like a cosplay, go do it better and find a real example of how editing a photo COSPLAY photo is hurting anybody."

Honestly though the “Odyssey” name is just a epic way of saying “adventure”. I think Assassin’s Creed rightfully used it in terms of the theme of the setting of Ancient Greece where the word “odyssey” was invented based on the classic story or what sone would call the first adventure story “The Odyssey”. But now it’s used often as a trendy title.

 I’m surprised no one has used “Trek” given Star Trek made that popular. Could you imagine if Super Mario Galaxy was named “Super Mario Trek”? Honestly that’s sounds like that could be a title for a new Mario game that doesn’t have to be about space."

The saga is based upon our real world. The timeline differs at the first game, where the events take place. Eventually, a man named kratos kills off the gods of that universe, which we know happens due to a spin-off franchise.

Due to the death of all gods, the universe collapses in on itself, before being reborn. Now, in modern times, feudal societies still exist, and possession of anyone without a hat is possible. 

thousands of years later, sea levels have risen, and piracy is popular. The human race eventually develops consistent space travel.

Earth is taken over by the sun in a solar flare, but ultimately, the human race survives and evolved to be unrecognizable to their first incarnation. Every world they land on is given the same name: oddworld."

I reached a point where it was driving me so mad that dying seemed like it would be such a relief from the fucking noise...  

And then I found this game. This silly little powerwashing game did something I didn't think was possible...it turned it off. It turned off the constant thoughts. I actually got to experience silence for the first time in 30 years and it's so goddamn beautiful.  

This game is the therapy I've never been able to afford."

Also, I'm not saying Gotham Knights isn't without issues, but did everyone forget the absolute dumpster fire that Arkham Knight was on release? They even pulled it off of store shelves a few weeks after it released.

I don't think there's a perfect game out there that will please everyone, but from playing both of these titles at launch, I don't care how good the game looks if I can't play it, and I've gotten WAY less crashes on GK than I ever did playing AK. They're both fun though, I dunno why GK is getting so much hate."

I've played the Arkham Games and I'm enjoying Gotham Knights every bit as much as the Arkham series.  I like the traversal better, the radiant crimes keep me engaged with incentives, the suits and weapon builds are plentiful too and Gotham is interesting to explore.  You get to see the Ice Berg Lounge, Stagg Industries, Fox Techa, Black Gate, Start Labs and many other cool landmarks!  The Bat cycle actually fits on the road, and looks like it can ride with other vehicles on the same road.  

The combat has its own style, either you love it or you don't.  However the grappling system sucks, sometimes it's limits you to random indicators of where you can grapple to.  For instance I may want a building across the street, but for some reason the indicator will only let me grapple to the lamp post to the the right of me wtf?🤬  The game is heavily frame based, which means every frame must be completed.  It's a aesthetic in a sense, but it makes it tough to acutely control the characters.  

Whatever they do they must finish, even when being attacked and they take damage.🤬 They took an approach with Red Hood that I initially didn't like, but it eventually grew on me. He's one of the most fun to play with the guns, and with the way the combat system works He's the best experience for it.  The camera is a huge problem in this game, it can cause so many things to go wrong.  The frame rate issue affects where they stand to, You must stand in the right place in order to get a command prompt for something. If you're in the sweet spot and move even a inch and the command prompt disappear, hitting the wrong button could change your stealth situation into an open brawl.🤬

Don't get me wrong The game certainly is flawed, but so were the Arkham games.  However I definitely feel the difference in the open world, I Love the fact that they are deep trenches within Gotham. Small lower income areas, that really look downtrodden. Also playing the game, the graphics don't look that bad to me. However these are all my opinions, I can understand if nobody else shares them 🫡👑"

Let me explain this, video game graphics... they stopped getting better around 2010.  A little after really but in that general region.  It's not that there's not slightly higher fidelity, more objects, more detailed textures, it's that you're not noticing any of that shit as you bounce around punching ninjas and thugs.  All they need to do is make what they are building actually look good, and your mind is going to fill in the little details, just like people who keep posting how they remember those old pixel art graphics looking way better than they did.  It's because the blurring of CRT mixed with the way human brains perceive and remember things made it look way better than it actually was.  

More polys, better texture resolution, more detailed shadows, they aren't REALLY improving things adding a tiny bit of resolution only the real graphics enthusiasts are going to pay attention to, and graphics are so good that's an increasingly tiny subsection of gamers.  So when you point out this game, half a decade later, looks like ass... it's because amateurs who took a lazy route didn't spend enough time and effort redesigning, or maybe are just fucking ass creators who don't know what's ""good"", but regardless it's because production failed to care enough to produce a coherent idea of their product, which is batman swinging around and beating people up on a dark stormy night.  

The problem here is either greed, ineptitude, or laziness, and it's predictable as fuck."

I haven't played the game yet, but I wish to when I have a better PC. I looked on it and I can't see any reason why it doesn't look amazing. As far as I understand, Batman: Arkham shows a very gothic Gotham while Gotham Knights tries to show it as more... typical American city, yet quite gritty. When I saw it in [one of the How Big Is The Map videos](https://youtu.be/_-x_4CrskAc), my first association was clear: Liberty City from Grand Theft Auto IV, and I think it's a good sign. Visual effects may be poorer than in Batman: Arkham Knight, but personally I think that the less effects, the better.

I think that people have chosen this game as a scapegoat of 2022. I understand why they hate Saints Row reboot. However, I see nothing wrong with Gotham Knights so far."

Not long after I played with it they just got rid of it. Its also the console I always had some kind of problems with. Discs would get torn up, the RROD would appear for various reasons. Not one 360 managed to work as long as any other consoles, even my first ever PS1 has managed to outlive them all no problem. I had so much fun playing Oblivion, Dead Rising, Red Dead, Halo 3 and many others. The controller is still my number 1 go to controller. But man, these things were not built to last."

I remember when I got my first xbox 360 I was just old enough to have saved up enough money to buy my first ever console. I was also like 11 so it was big for me. Of course because it just my piggy bank savings all I was able to get was the Xbox 360 version with no hard drive, and the only game I got was Oblivion. 

I was so excited to get home and play only to quickly realize that without my hard drive there was no chance I was able to fully enjoy the massive RPG that was Oblivion. After replaying that opening sewer mission about 15 times every time I booted the game up I just resorted to leaving my xbox on for a day until my dad got me a hard drive that way I can truly enjoy my first big purhcase.

I have an M. Ed. I taught at elementary, middle, and high schools for 10 years and was a principal for five more. I have studied this to help parents understand the situation. 

1. Video games are generally better than TV because games are interactive. They require using your brain to solve problems. Video does not; it's a passive acceptance of what's on the screen. 
2. Children under 2 yrs old should not have any time with a screen. Once they start getting older, it can gradually be added. One hour of video games and/or videos *per day* should be fine as long as your kids are in elementary school. 
3. Like it or not, games are a big part of our culture these days. Letting kids play popular games and watch popular shows/movies can help kids fit in with their peer group and increase socialization. (It's not a lock but it can increase the odds.) 
4. Every child is unique, and your children may have special needs that make video games less or more harmful. But outside of major issues like autism, such needs shouldn't be a problem. 
5. Video games can increase violence in a small percentage of the population but that's mainly for kids who already have violent tendencies. Games also do not act like violent catharsis; playing a violent game doesn't decrease the chances of violence either. 

One last thing. Sometimes, people don't want to know the truth if it forces them to change. Sounds to me like your wife means well but is stuck in an older mentality that video games are evil and teach kids how to be killers. Maybe have a rational, measured conversation where y'all go over her reservations specifically, not just that she doesn't like it, and brainstorm ways to address her concerns."

One thing we talk about is evaluating what is happening through the technology. For instance if your kid is playing football they get exercise, sure, but they also get teamwork, communication, planning, thrill of victory and defeat. Same is true of team matches in Fortnite (except exercise). A lot of games have puzzle and critical thinking aspects. Playing cooperative games is a great way to bond with your kids and work towards a common goal. It can even be a teaching time to go over lessons your family wants reflected in their values.

I moved out a while back so it's nice to spend some time with him, even if it's on a game! He will still text me after we've played a few rounds of COD to say how much he enjoyed playing.

It's something I'm really glad we get to do still. He will watch endless YouTube videos learning tips and tricks to surprise me when we next play.

Aight mate, here is how you do it.

This will probably be best on a computer, or with a Nintendo console.

Find a good puzzle genre game. Not like Candy Crush or Wordle, I’m talking like Myst, or even better, The Witness. These are games that have no inherent violence in them so that argument is gone. Next, have THEM try playing the game. The Witness is a very easy to understand, challenging to ace game. There are walkthroughs on it, so don’t worry if they get stuck. Theres a hidden message in it. It’s not obvious unless you really look for it. Same thing with Myst, although it’s much harder and not exactly replay worthy. Then once they’ve finished those games, show them another game of a different genre, not horror, not FPS, but adventure/rpg/jrpg. It’s a very different game experience, but now we approach the idea that puzzles exist even in things that aren’t labeled puzzles. Next, introduce them to a more advanced genre: survival. My recommendation is Subnautica. It’s a great game and the sequel is just as good. It’s a fairly intense game, as it is horrifying at parts, but this is the important part to introduce here. Here we are now FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES. Against things like we will never (hopefully) see in real life, but using (somewhat) realistic skills to overcome natural problems and limitations. It’s still puzzles. They are just the more un-fun puzzles, like how much titanium can I carry in one trip, how long can I take to collect that much, and how many trips will that take to finish building my add on to my base so I can store more stuff and have more things in the base. Or how long until I need to reoxygenate, and am I close enough to air for that to still work without an act of god. Or, how do I distract this horrifying monster from trying to eat me, and how do I get rid of it should the distraction not work. These are the puzzles that games inherently teach us to be able to solve. They are not exactly *fun* puzzles, but the satisfaction once you are proven correct is more than adequate. Incidentally, on these three occasions you show them the beauty of modern games.

Final step. Splurge and buy a pong console. You heard me. The OG pong console was never truly documented because everyone made one back then. Show them the first commercially sold video game in its entirety. The first sensational game that made everyone either excited, or confused. Then show her the others. And point out that it’s been about forty years since video games started with Pong. Almost a half a century. And Subnautica, the Witness, and The legend of Zelda are results of those forty years of development. We came from square pixel balls and single digit scoreboards, with two colors only, to breathtaking vistas of alien planets hellbent on making sure we never leave, and if we do, never return. Vast landscapes that are chock full of activities that constantly engage us with tasks to train our mind to work harder with less reward. And bizarre places where we are the last ones left, but strangely we have access to everything necessary, and everything is connected… somehow… and the messages of the most influential people in philosophy and science speak their mind to show a decent contrast between the various paths we face and how to approach them. These are result of *beep beep beep boop* being so popular that there was an overwhelming number of types of the game sold. Show her cave drawings and ask if she thinks that those rotted the brains of the cavemen who drew them. Play music from the early 1900s, and ask if that music rotted the minds of the musicians of the world (or go even further back, to Bach or Mozart). Show her the silent films of the early twentieth century and ask if these documentaries are more decay-inducing than the National Geographic documentaries produced today. Then ask her about video games again, and how they can possibly be brain warping if they are interactive versions of all three of those genres, and more of it at once, too.

I had a similar struggle trying to convince my family that video games were a great thing to play for your mental health, as they promote the most important skill of all time: thinking outside the box. Portal. Experiment number eighteen. I guess I just die, right? Lol, no thanks, I’m just going to head on out now. Later GLADOS. Oh NOW you want me to stick around, huh? Hmmm, well that’s not happening because you have already played your cards and I am not playing that game. Minecraft. Well, I guess I just have one instruction, to press Q to get the inventory screen, right? No, there’s far more to it than that. DROD (deadly rooms of death). So I basically just hit things with swords and kill them before they kill me? No you f###ing donkey! You have to think! That roach is way too close to kill right now, you need to reposition yourself to a better location so you can kill it! Don’t panic, because every room can be completed (in theory), but you plan out your moves properly and you will always win. Video games love to pull the hit-n-run mechanic on players, the “Gotcha” rule. There’s always a catch. Trust nothing and no one. You know that you are going in the right direction when things happen to try and stop you. Sometimes the most effective way to do something, is to let something else do it for you. Wisdom is crammed inside this form of media, and only by playing it, can we actually access this valuable knowledge and experience."

Lol I literally keep up 6 acres of land and work a full time job and workout 4 days a week without ever missing a day. I’m one of the least lazy people I know. Something in her brain has been convinced that video games=lazy loser. I think it was the fact that her parents act that way about video games and her brother is a huge video game nerd. It really annoys me because I love playing video games. I very rarely do it like maybe a couple hours a week. It’s my time to go to another place and forget about the world during the rare periods of time where I actually have free time to enjoy. Idk man I think woman have been conditioned to see guys that play video games as video game nerds. Maybe 20+ years ago only nerds played video games. Now everybody from NFL superstars to political leaders play video games. Idk man woman are crazy.

TV is ok - but video games rot the brain... they were a little worse than just that (in some ways) like, to punish me they would take away my computer so I couldn't learn to program (""computers are just a fad anyway"")... etc.

Anyway... I would buy her a book on a topic she hates. Then, I would constantly remind her that instead of watching TV or doing whatever she likes... that it rots her brain and she should be reading the book you picked out because reading is better for her.

Get her a book on video games.

If she tries to argue that it's not helpful for her to learn or read it. Remind her she is READING and it's much better than watching TV or whatever her hobbies are.

Perfect book - Getting Gamers: The Psychology of Video Games and Their Impact on the People who Play Them"

Patience,
Trial and error,
How to handle victory,
How to handle defeat,
Problem solving,
Resource management,
Teamwork,
And Hand eye coordination.

And last but not least, you can build friendships.

I remember when i first got Xbox Live in 2006 and i started playing Gears of War and I would always match with this dude.

We eventually became friends to the point i was a groomsmen at his wedding last year. We are like brothers now.

I've never played it myself, not the biggest fan of FPS or Battle Royales (except the movie) but when they introduced El Chapulin Colorado, all of a sudden I saw kids looking up and getting into old El Chavo del 8. And that's sounds great. My parents grew up with it and then when I was a kid in the early 2000s I too grew up with it. And it's great knowing that it might inadvertently make the next generation of kids that weren't even raised in a LatAm household tangentially aware of the works made by Chespirito. 

I see all the characters being added as way to easily introduce these characters from fiction to kids. Go right ahead, sounds like a win. No need to hate it gatekeep. If they're really interested, they will learn the characters names, play the games and watch the shows all by themselves. Let people enjoy things naturally, damn."

How did you keep the nurse restrained while doing all that makeup?

Did you have to drug them?

Were they a friend who trusted you and didn't fight? 

How did you get them to pose like that? Was it because of all the drugs you had to use on them, and they just ended up that way? 


Ps: You shouldn't really make people do things for you like this as it may cause them to have ptsd. Especially nurses, they take care of us if we end up in the hospital! You may also get labeled by society because drugging people and keeping them against their will is frowned upon.

I knew of the existence of #2 later in life, but not at the time.  I had my parents buy a SNES, not a PS1.  I didn't own a Playstation until PS3 and I think that is the only one I ever owned.

I had just logged into an shop/upgrade machine, and just as I'm doing so, I think a necromorph dropped out of a vent shaft, or just came down the hall, I'm kind of fuzzy on that detail.

So, I log out of the machine, turn around to face him and he's at spitting distance. So, I slap him across the face with my plasma cutter, take a leg, then an arm and then stomped on him for good measure while complaining that he was rude.

Then took a deep breath, turned around, and got back to my transaction."

They aren't intended to be a traditional collectable that players 100%. Sure, you can if you want. But their primary purpose is simply to function as a marker of intent from the developers to the players who want to explore. They are meant to make the giant open world feel intentional, because it's something that is largely missing from most open world games. It means that some seemingly out of the way location wasn't just randomly generated by an algorithm. That developer eyes graced that location."

You have to visit a place that is named and have the name appear on the screen.  Which doesn't sound too hard. But checking the entire map for what you've discovered and what you haven't is a nightmare.

It took me hours before I realized the one missing was the eighth goddess statue that you have to take a picture of. Because I didn't get close enough it didn't come up on the screen so when checking I was like, yeah of course I've been there it was a quest. 

There really should be some sort of system to direct you to the missing %"

It's why you only need 70 out of 120 stars in Mario 64. Your reward in Mario 64 for getting all 120 stars is similarly underwhelming if you obsessed over getting everything, it's>!

Physical is a bit different, but I'm not dropping $70 for a baseline Switch game. The first BotW had frame rate issues bad enough, and the system is in its 6th year (I'm on oled, for what it's worth.) I can justify it for PS5 or PC because I can run a game in 4k, 60 fps, etc, but I'm not doing it for a 720p Switch game.

I'll just watch Vinesauce play it."

Unless I actively seek out this sub, the only thing I see that comes from it is someone promoting themselves. Just nonstop ads to wishlist something on Steam or follow someone on Instagram. Do you guys never get tired of this stuff? You guys don't actually care about how accurate the costume is. If the woman wasn't hot literally nobody would care about this post lmao. It's gotten to the point where posts like this easily surpass actual discussion about gaming each and every time. Unique game clips, of really anything much more directly linked to gaming. 

This sub has some good stuff. It's hard to find though because soooo many horny Redditors upvote any decent looking woman with a DSLR and a costume to the moon lmao."

An alien space craft broke up in Earth's atmosphere sending debris everywhere and the pieces cause all kinds of weird things to happen around where they landed. The show centers around the agents tasked to investigate and it's similar to how the FBC from the game operates.
The HBO adaptation I want next,,10sxk9l,23275,1648,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10sxk9l/the_hbo_adaptation_i_want_next/,torn-ainbow,"Control is like a mystery box, but one that has a kind of circular reasoning for existing. A bit like a time paradox which ultimately triggers itself, we accept it exists once it ties up it's own loose end. But Control still leaves a huge room for more mystery and strangeness. Despite basically being set in one building, there is massive scope and places to go after the story of the game is complete. 

Because the entire thing would be set in The Oldest House, it seems like a good candidate for 360 video wall type technology. Develop a full set of models and tools for creating and animating the retro brutalist concrete liminal spaces and offices, along with their ability to morph and change. The multi-dimensional weirdness parts could all be modeled this way too. Hang the actor from wires on that set and you can do some flying without other effects or full cgi characters.

You would have to build some physical sets for some scenes, so hopefully you could get a match between the the brutalist concrete being rendered and the irl sets. To some extent they can both look slightly otherworldly and unnatural, that's kinda what those places are."

Might be just a tad too close to severance for producers to fully be on board though, at least until that show wraps up.

Usually the question is ""What would a movie/show add to the experience of the game?"" which fails 99% of the time. For this an episodic, borderline anthology type show would probably work very well with all of the Objects of Power being given their own story x-files style."

graphics are decent, the UI looks bland but usable ( better than bloated and shit imho ), animations are meh, world looks empty and abandoned which might be the intention, and there seems to be a decent amount of lootable shit.

If all it becomes is ""dayZ but without the shit graphics, zombies and interaction"", it's gonna have a niche spot. and already better than ""The war Z""

that said, it looks nothing like their older trailer."

Sure it's a hack n slash with rhythm and there is rhythm platformers (Inside My Radio), the shooter Hellsinger, Necrodancer even it's not uncommon to find rhythm something in the Indie space.

A fair post but then again veterans make new indie studios, 1 to 10 people indies also exist. The earliest of Indies in 2003 like Alien Hominid one of the few 2D games I know on sixth gen consoles not on handhelds was by Newgrounds staff which people know for Castle Crushers and other games today. I don't play many Indies big or small (buy physical) but when I do see AAA have that experimental title/ambitious title can't wait to play it no matter what.

I could go back to PS2 era games that no/very few Indies when AAA or B grade or whatever have crazy ideas (I mean the less notable games too) but most Indies today I don't care for because they are made up of particular popular titles not the ones that sure are by AAA or B grade but never took inspiration from them. I can find them and that's not even counting actual niche Japanese games either.

There is tons of platformers, racing games or more from fifth/sixth gen I could pull from that no one has returned such ideas for in favour of old popular, trends or whatever else.

But there is also series that play catchup, follow trends or backtrack ideas I like in one entry and it sets it in stone for me to give up or hang around. Dual wielding gone. Summons in action games. Nostalgia or remixing content instead of actually thinking about their design.

I mean sure PN03 isn't perfect but what game has a dodging/not typical system of control while the rest have the typical third person shooter approach to these days. I guess it's tank controls maybe but still it's interesting the praise RE4 gets and while PNO3 is rushed it's still unique for the time. Sure you have a Vita game I saw that was trying to be RE/Silent Hill but I haven't seen much else.

If Biomutant had fifth/sixth gen platformer animal abilities I'd have cared more to play it (gas barriers and protection for that was fine but no fins, wings or stats for swimming and flight I have to use a glider and vehicles, why? If not in a sequel then I give up).

Other than Gun Gun Pixies sure it's a Mr Mosquito or Demolition Girl type game I guess for niche Japanese game as some successor.

Where is my car builder to make my own with presets of the parts, the shell, whatever I want not just licensed cars oh wait we only have liveries and such ah, so I have to go to Sega GT/Supercar Street Challenge/Apex for more involving that I'm looking for right to make my own car or pretend to be a car manufacturer right. Where is my Car RPG elements like Alfa Romeo Racing Italano (had rewind before Grid or Forza Motorsport 3) or Evolution GT in this day and age not seen any, we have your Outrun, Virtua Racing or other nostalgia like games such as Horizon Chase Turbo and I forget the others names but that's about it. I mean Art of Rally is good in it's way too but still. Many games are still just dead. I assume some devs will get to it at some point but I just don't see it. I know some are getting to fifth/sixth gen but most are still older gens or not even close to such ideas even which sure tons of ways to take a game but still.

Phones are the last straw with dual screens or else died with Wii U and 3DS or Vita and PS4. If they are primarily productivity devices then sure. But then again Pocket PCs/PDAs of the 2000s, PSP with cables/Go, Nomad, Steam Deck and Switch nowadays.

Like RE being a successor to Sweet Home it's the forgotten titles I care about the most with their ideas not further explored. Or enough physics and platformer and level design and item use in such a way that some do of course like Breath of the Wild (played) or Dead Rising or GTA or something I find interesting of interactivity no matter how stupid, fun or fictional it is, don't care to play them but I still respect the elements that are interesting about them."

“Good graphics” gets a lot of hate by Gamers and critics alike, maybe because it’s the most obvious of improvements over time, so it’s considered to be an unintelligent thing to get excited about.

Imitating reality to the point of the uncanny valley is not art, and nor is it inherently beautiful. It is a lack of imagination to attempt to only show the reality itself, rather than the interpretation.

""Realistic graphics"" will age worse than any artstyle because they live and die by the reality we live in. With those comparisons constantly changing with tech, it becomes both less impressive and fades very quickly.

Without a defined artstyle, your visuals just aren't memorable, and very few Triple A games have a unique visual style these days."

Every character was a ridiculous parody, every other character was a lesbian biker and their dialogue was written by a twelve year old in his lunch break. The main character's girlfriend was unintentionally hilarious! The way she walked, deliberately in front of the camera, with that overemphasized sway to her arse - the animators were obviously twelve year old boys too!

 The only thing that saved this game was the gameplay."

The gameplay was smooth, and the crafting system was well implemented.

The game world environment was slightly empty, but it had a charm to it.

The story was decent but a little drawn out at times. Some of the quests seemed incomplete. >! For instance, why did we collect all those explosives to seal a tunnel and never do it? !<

Once I got to the final zone, I started having issues with the terrain messing up. During one of the final missions, a huge section of the Ark failed to load, so I had to close and restart the game for it to be fixed. A few times the clutter inside buildings failed to load.

Deacon talks to himself as much as I do. I found that interesting as it is a sign of untreated ADHA.

1) The good: The hordes - especially the super hordes or whatever they were called - were awesome. 

2) The bad: The story. The story wasn’t awful but it just really kinda left you wanting more. There is a moment late in the game where it feels like it’ll come together, but it just never does.

It will happen in gameplay too but FAR less bright and clear.  Its not an on/off effect.  The intensity is entirely based on how dark the area is and how bright lights are near your viewmod.  Sometimes during boss battles or something you might catch a very slight glimpse of it which is pretty cool.  I played through the entire original game without ever realizing it was possible.

There are times this legit looks like a ps4 game. The lighting and texture work is incredible for a 20+ year old Gamecube game. Prime ALWAYS looked amazing, but MP:R is so crisp now.

I just got to the Talon overworld and my heart did a little flip when I saw not only raindrops on the visor but also hitting Samus’s arm cannon and fingers. Like, they could have just not added that detail and I dont think anyone would have complained, but it looks SO GOOD. 

N has had some solid remasters in the past, but it seems there’s always some caveat. Even the Ocarina and Majora remakes were limited by the 3DS hardware. Sure they were an improvement over the original games, but nothing like this.

This is a full HD remaster - almost leaning close to a complete rebuilding judging from how so much of the game’s geometry has been updated and overhauled. And yet…it’s still Metroid Prime. 

And OH MY GOD playing this with the twin stick controller option rockets this game directly into the modern gaming landscape.

This is currently THE best Metroid game that has been released yet. The Remaster just sent this straight to the very top of my “best Nintendo games EVER” list."

an external burst of light should hide an internal reflection, not produce it.

Let me see some of the curves of the helmet and edges of the visor, let me see the characters reflection briefly in moments like this, let me hear them panic or their breathing get heavy if they're hurt. I want all out immersion like this.

Metroid Prime was way ahead of its fucking time with all these touches and it's outright fucking ***pathetic*** hardly any other games have done this since.

&#x200B;

Only other game in recent times I have played with some level of immersion with your character was Need For Speed Shift. There still hasn't been a racing game since that, that has done such detailed cockpits, quality driver animations, and cool effects. You'd be affected if you were hit, you could hear the driver panic if they were starting to spin out, the screen would blur and lose color, sound would disappear if they got in an impact, you could hear their breathing get heavier, sound drown out and even heartbeat a little when speeds got really high. That game was really impressive too, kind of up the same vein as this where they went an extra step to try and help you feel like you were there."

They set up an obvious crit/backstab opportunity against a kinda tough troll foe, but you have to be sneaky about it 

As you approach there's a hard-to-see dinky crow on the ground that can blow the sneak attack

and the pièce de résistance is a literal troll comes up from your right and smashed you to smithereens.

This then allows the troll you were going to backstab to double team you until you are a spitroast on a BDSM channel.

You start off as a scutty kid in Whitechapel or as an officer boy. The scope is endless. On whaler or on a navy vessel maybe.

You work your way up. Learn navigation, become a sailor.
No swinging the lead. You have endless choices to how your career progresses in the ultimate era of change. You could go into piracy and slavery. Riding the trade winds or maybe you could sail for the crown. Resplendent in your authority. Fighting piracy.

Legitimately, this is going to rival some of the all time great years of game releases.

ESPECIALLY if Starfield turns out to be Bethesda's return to making cutting edge, industry leading RPG's. For me it has the most potential in both directions. It could blow my expectations out of the water or leave me bitterly disappointed."
The big 3 releases for this year,,10cvpf8,14986,2615,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10cvpf8/the_big_3_releases_for_this_year/,balwick,"I know I'm going to put 1000's of hours into Starfield. I have about 5000 between Fallout 4 and Skyrim.

I had some concerns about Starfield, but they've really fallen away as I get more excited, and more details have been revealed. 

E.g.; There are lots of planets, and they were initially procedurally generated, but Artists are working away at polishing them. Also, the Random Encounter system has seen such an improvement that entire structures/dungeons etc. can be spawned, rather than just NPCs as in the days of yore.

Character creation and skill levelling combines the best elements from the catalogue of Bethesda RPG titles; You choose a background which affects starting perks and traits, you can choose extra traits in character creation, skills level through use to unlock new perks. There's also \*unconfirmed\* rumours that your start will have options ala Alternate Start, or I guess Cyberpunk 2077.

Hypedump over.

Also Armored Core making a return? Inject it into my veins pls."

Hopefully the Master Sword doesn't need to recharge for 10 real time minutes in this game.

Hopefully weapons, including boss rewards, don't break after 2-3 fights without a option to repair.

I hope the game has a narrative, and not just walking around completing the shrines.

I hope the ""combat challenges"" aren't the same single enemy over and over and over again."

However, I gotta say that the digital version—MTG: Arena—is fantastic even if you don't spend any money. It's free-to-play, it offers generous daily play rewards, and the gold coins you get from regular play can be used to buy virtual packs and get more cards.

I've been playing Arena for over a year now and must have accumulated at least 200 hours of play time, and I haven't spent a dime on it. I just play each week, accumulate 90,000 gold coins as quickly as I can, and then buy 90 booster packs (I think 90 boosters for 90,000 gold is the bundle with the best value). 

I'm averaging 90,000 gold every 3 months, which is really easy to do if you just play regularly. It doesn't even feel like a grind, because you only have to play like 5-10 games per day to do the daily ""quests"" and max out your daily gold rewards. You can play 5-10 games in an hour, easily.

I even got up to the Diamond Tier in ranked play. I once beat someone who's ranked in the top 100 (when you rank high enough, your standing appears beside your screen name). He had all these rare cards, but I still beat him soundly with a red / blue blitz deck loaded with nothing but commons and uncommons.

If you're looking for a game where you can spend $0.00 and beat someone who's spent hundreds of dollars, MTG: Arena is an excellent choice."

It's not pay to win from wizards perspective. They just sell cardboard with varying degrees of rarity and power. They are not selling individual cards.

Yet, as soon as the packs are sold and opened, it becomes pay to win because of the vast difference in power between cards. The only ones truly benefiting from pay to win are scalpers and resellers."

I learned of Magic later on and I'm glad I didn't get sucked into that too because I'd have spent everything on it. I spent probably $300+ on Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh cards, I no longer have any of them though. 

The Pokemon cards were destroyed by my nephew with some of those cards now being worth hundreds and they were in pristine condition. Yu-Gi-Oh I ended up giving it away until a buddy gave me his collection and I sold it for $11 to get gas so I could get home. I regret selling them but it was necessary so I could get to work the next day.

It's a shame because I played through the collection recently and some of the set piece moments are still some of the biggest and most epic moments in gaming. I can't quite put my finger on it but there's something Naughty Dog does in those moments that make me feel like I have more agency and control than when other people do huge set piece moments.

Im probably wrong but I just don't see people talking about the Uncharted series as much as I think they should be."

Like the last of us I discovered how amazing they were very late. Only got a ps4 pro about 4 years ago to finally play all the exclusives I never had. I’ve always been PC based. Bonus was I got all the triple A games for like £5-£10 each. Finished the last of us and the sequel came out a week later, played GOW and then the sequel teaser dropped. Played Uncharted 1,2,3 then instantly bought 4 for £3. My eyes could not believe the detail, fidelity and overwhelming creativity. Truly are masterpieces of gaming, the last of us especially.

You uncover an old map that directs you to a rusted old key which unlocks a run-down pathway into an abandoned castle that hasn't been occupied in centuries.

Until you make it into the courtyard where an entire platoon of henchmen have somehow setup an entire armed defensive position with mounted LMGs, stockpiled ammunition and explosives. 

There was always someone to greet you on the other side."

It's just so scripted and so on rails. No mechanic has any depth, the cover shooting feels like a relic from 2013, the traversal is hold the analog stick and look at the vistas. What I really loved was the last boss fight and I wish the game had more of that. I didn't really feel like I was doing much. It's like an interactive movie which I guess was the aim but I just wish it had deeper game mechanics and gave the player some kind of agency. At some point I just got bored and I wanted the game to just be over . I understand why people love these games and I understand why people also don't like these games.

1 was tough. I recognized I was playing an ancient game, but it was 10-15 hours of not very fun gaming. The story was occasionally strong enough to keep me invested, but longer exploration sequences were tough. 


2 was fun. There were some very memorable set pieces, the city, the train. But I got very tired of playing the formula by the end. The ending was tedious too. Shangri la was cool, but that boss battle was awful. And the combat is so annoying, I was so sick of playing the gameplay loop.


I don’t have the heart to pick up 3, especially after reading it’s worse than 2. I want to make it to 4, but honestly I’m burnt out. It’s been many months since I finished 2, I can’t work myself up to starting 3 or 4."

UI this cluttered should be illegal,,10tl2io,14420,962,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10tl2io/ui_this_cluttered_should_be_illegal/,TakuiXD,"Truthfully by today's standards, seems very normal. I've seen older games with worse UI than this here. So long as the game allows for you to customize the UI to your liking then that is perfectly fine, the devs aren't obligated to make everything to one person's liking regarding how UI is placed in a game like this. I've seen lots of people complain about UI like this but never customize the settings to better suit them, why? Laziness. As long as the base settings allow for playability fully where it's placed, how much stuff is on screen usually don't matter as lots of games especially mobile have too many features and most of the time it's better to directly be able to access them on screen at any given time. Point is if you can customize it, do so, 95% games at least those I have played allow you to do so, unless there's a specific reason to have the UI set in a specific way. I agree most mobile games are trash, but I've never had to complain that UI was so bad and cluttered, that it's a problem. Features that have no use to me get removed off screen or opacity set to 0 and size 0, then moved to a spot I won't touch."

In 2005, my friends and I entered a contest called Hex168, submitting a video that ended up getting selected as a grand prize winner. All six of us got all-expenses-paid trips to LA for the launch party of the console, staying at a hotel near the repurposed air force hangar in the Mojave.

However, the other part of the prize was the we all received our consoles a full week ahead of street date. Now, the original plan was for us to also receive six launch titles (CoD 2, Perfect Dark Zero, and several others). Due to logistics issues, the games did not make it at the same time, so we were sent home from the trip with all of the promised games.

Since I had a copy of Halo 2 lying around, and since I had heard the box was backward-compatible, I popped it in. On the first attempt to play it, the console spun up and did not launch the game. I tried to eject the disc, but it wouldn't come out. I was feeling pretty panicked that I had already managed to ruin my brand-new Xbox, so I rifled through the documentation and found a support phone line.

I called the number during regular business hours and got someone after several rings. ""Uhhh, hello?"" the voice asked. I asked if this was the Xbox support number. ""Yes, but... you shouldn't have this number."" This was because it was ahead of street. I explained that I was a contest winner and could provide the serial number on my console, as well as the issue I was experiencing. ""Uhh, hang on. Let me get my supervisor. We're not supposed to be taking these calls yet.""

So the dude gets his super on the line and once again I explain my situation. He finally agrees to help and gets out the training manual. He finds the section on manual disc ejection and I find a paper clip. It works like a charm and my Xbox is saved. At least until it red-ringed a few months later 😆"

Apple released the successor to the wildly popular Apple II, the Apple III. 

It…was…a…piece…of…junk. 

One particularly fun thing was that they skimped on the cooling so it would heat up, the metal would expand, and some of the chips would pop out of socket a little causing all kinds of issues. 

What was Apple’s response to customers?

Pick it up a few inches off the desk…then drop it. 

That would usually reseat the chips.

you have to reset and maintain an increasingly-complex series of dungeons and tombs, all while doing your best to stay out of sight of The Hero.  The Hero is a hellish monster, a true cryptid known for tearing apart the lives of your less-fortunate colleagues, and inspiring tales of grim woe for generations.  

of course, what appears as a cryptid to a dungeon-dwelling zombie looks like a mere garden-variety adventurer to you or i.  their appearance is randomised when you enter the dungeon-- in some cases, it's just a tiny human child with a spellbook causing all this terror in the goblin community."

I hope I haven't just played through most of the game. You left a lot for me and my kid to play when the game releases, right?

Anyway, It's good, and I've wishlisted it.

I'll put this feedback behind a spoiler, because spoilers

>!Personally, I had a hard time with the microgravity sun. It was fun when I just ran and jumped and flew around the thing. That was cool, but the controls felt .... wrong. and it's just not fun to struggle with a puzzle in game simply because the controls don't let you move the way you expect to. In the rest of the game, the controls are absolute. up always means up. But here, the controls switch to relative. Now 'up' suddenly means something else. Cognitively, this is confusing, but not in a fun way.!< 

>!i LOVED falling down the bounce room. That was silly fun. I hope you put a couple more of those in the game, and maybe just randomly in places, chucking the character up into the air, ragdoll pinwheeling through the sky. surprise! !< 

so anyway, thanks for the fun, and good luck."

Is rare I guess.

Released for the PlayStation 4 on August 12, 2014 as a free download on the PlayStation Network, P.T. served as an interactive teaser for the game Silent Hills, an installment in the Silent Hill series. After the cancellation of Silent Hills, Konami removed P.T. from the PlayStation Store and made it impossible to reinstall. The decision prompted criticism, fan efforts to allow P.T. to be re-downloaded,and fan remakes."

The father purchased the rifle used in the crime at his local gunstore two days earlier. This brutal killing took place while the family was gathered at home on a Sunday afternoon. The day of the crime, the father went to the trunk of his car, retrieved the rifle, and shot his wife as she was cleaning up the kitchen after lunch. When his ten-year-old son came to investigate the commotion, the father shot him, too. His six-year-old daughter had the good sense to hide in the bathroom, but reports suggest he lured her out by telling her it was just a game. The girl was found shot once in the chest from point-blank range. The mother, who he shot in the stomach, was pregnant at the time. Police arriving on-scene after neighbors called 911 found the father in his car, listening to the radio. Several days before the murders, neighbors say they heard the father repeating a sequence of numbers in a loud voice. They said it was like he was chanting some strange spell. There was another family shot to death in the same state last month, and in December last year, a man used a rifle and meat cleaver to murder his entire family. In each case, the perpretrators were fathers. State police say the string of domestic homicides appears unrelated, though it could be part of a larger trend, such as employment, childcare, and other social issues facing the average family."

There isn’t enough of a compelling story to make a true to game Gears show and because there isn’t, it will alienate the hardcore fan base because an actual narrative will need to be created that fans won’t recognize. I love Gears, I’ve played every single one, multiple times. There is nothing to this game but shooting missions, no storyline but “get from point A to point B and kill everything along the way.” Yes there’s the Queen and how they’re fleeing the Lambent, but it’s not enough to create a show from without making up a new storyline which fans have routinely rejected in every other game adaptation show."

There's just so much fine and dense detail here that no AA method could resolve properly like this without being combined with a very high resolution.  

And it's also why high resolution is so critical and not a waste at all.  As games get more detailed, we need resolution to keep up to handle it, especially in motion.  Reconstruction techniques are a god send to enable this without hugely increasing GPU and memory demands."

Played it entirely on the steam deck.

Loved every minute of it and I am planning on going back and playing through the end game a bit more.

I haven't enjoyed a game this much since I picked up Hades.

By the time I got to SC4, I had a better understanding and was able to finally achieve those goals. But another wild concept came to me: building a small rural town and keeping it small! I found a fascination with just making a village surrounded by farmland, with a little commercial Main Street in the center. I'd connect it to all the other large cities around it (thanks to the region map) and even had highways connecting those regions to each other, with my little farming community between them. It was a nice zen garden-style experience between the hustle and bustle of the big cities."

And the parkour looked cool, and the trailer shows her leaping off and landing safely, but I lost a huge chunk of life leaping off a small hill.

edit: And my biggest gripe is there’s just something about the way that Frey talks, her accent, that hurts my throat.  Because I imagine myself trying to suppress an English accent and force an American one.  And I’m just thinking that scene in Home Alone when Kevin calls the police but lowers his voice to sound older.  kind of like that.

New IP, graphics looked actually next-gen (at the time it was announced), but too many red flags. It's made by the people that made FFXV, one of the emptiest of open worlds. Then found out the main campaign is 15-16 hours. For an open world game, that's not great, usually means the bulk of the game is repetitive side content. I mostly play for story, and it sounds like the story is paper thin. Cuff sounds like they're trying to do Nier Replicant just with a bangle instead of a book. And finally, the main character comes off like she was written by a bunch of dudes who have never talked to an actual young person of color in their lives. Real ""how do you do fellow kids?"" vibes. (This is based on trailers and footage, so might be better in the actual game, I hope.)

But when you have a MC that is constantly dropping F bombs left and right, they’re constantly nagging about everything and it doesn’t get much better with progress and they have constant arguments with a talking cuff, that’s not “wokeness” that’s being an annoying character(s). Let’s not get started on how the MC doesn’t even want to be a part of  the game and are constantly telling other people to F off. How do you you play a character that doesn’t want to do anything? 😂.

I think its a flattering over-complication of bad writing. If something is badly written and tries to make a commentary that falls flatter than printer paper i feel like thats not the fault of the attempted message but the writer themselves. If you cant write a character in a focus group without drawing attention to the group directly that seems to imply you just suck at writing characters. Woke honestly seems more benefitted by being an afterthought because that mean youd have to have actually gotten someones attention on the merit of the character or story first and foremost giving you room to put your message in.

I could barely tolerate SquareEnix's *Guardians of the Galaxy* in 2021 for the back and forth egging between characters (even if it was somewhat true to the canon) with how *constant* it was. This looked to upscale that.  


I was really excited to see the potential for a strong, female-led POC protagonist, especially given the TV adaptation of *Kindred* (cause between Octavia Butler and NK Jeminsin, I'm not sure who else has written stellar POC-protagonists - not to say they are the only ones to have done so, but that they have done so *extraordinarily* well). But.. man.  
Every little bit more I learn about how this game plays out has me losing hope that SquareEnix can't put out *stories* as well as they used to."

It’s like a mix between fallout and teletubies.  Everything is dark, gloomy, and covered in waste.  But the dialogue is always something like “Go to the fuzzy fields and get the tinkerturner.  But watch out for puffy-floos and their gurgerly-goos.”"

So much so that I went out on my lunch break to the next town over just to own the game as early as possible. I couldn't wait until after work to get it. 

Turns out Spider-Man 3 was made for the Playstation 3, and the PS2 version was a steaming pile of hot shit. The graphics, gameplay, game world were all leagues worse than in Spider-Man 2. This thing was a monstrosity and the memory of my foolish hope has been burned into my soul."

The graphics are shit, songs are missing, it’s still filled with bugs, and most models/textures were clearly ran through some quick automated model vs being deliberately designed by a human. A sloppy mess clearly undeserving of a $60 price tag. Rockstar clearly doesn’t give a shit about these games and thought so little of them as to delegate development outside the company to Grove Street Games (a mobile game company!) who themselves didn’t give a shit and were defiant and insulting in response to fan backlash. Rockstar has enough resources from their GTA5 micro transactions to do this game right (and since they didn’t to refund buyers of this shit title). Not the disaster that cyberpunk was but a totally unforced error where they promised the world and then did just everything wrong."

I really REALLY wanna like the game since several of my friends play it a ton. But jesus christ, no other game leaves me feeling as utterly drained and bored as this game. Don't get me wrong, the gunplay is great but I just end up feeling like I have zero goals to work towards. Usually games that have a lot of armor and gear to customize with hook me a lot, but the only time I actually get to see any of it is when I'm just sitting at the tower. I honestly think I'd enjoy the game a lot more if they had a third person option (outside of just using a sword) since at least then I'd care about trying to get new armor.

And then there's the actual gameplay loop. The actual loop just feels like a job to me. Just completing soulless ""dailies"" and ""weeklies"" over and over in a cycle. When I play a game, what usually drives me to keep playing is story, cool looking armor as a goal, or uniquely satisfying gameplay. I've really tried to enjoy the story in Destiny, but the fact that I feel like little more than a bystander makes it feel more enjoyable just to watch it on YouTube. And as I said before, the gunplay is good but it doesn't exactly do anything new. It's just well executed shooting, which tbh there are so many FPS games that it just doesn't really hook me. And I've already mentioned my issue with armor as a goal.

And I mention this game here because I bought it at full price on release to play with my friends, only to have the game go F2P with zero gifts for having paid $60 for it. Makes me feel like I paid full price for a beta test without being told that that's what it was."

As long as you are happy playing games, keep on doing them and stop comparing you with others. 

Im 29, single for I think 5 years now, gaming since I was 4 and still doing it. 

Yes, a new GF would be cool and all but I am happy where I am rn. 

Gaming is a huge part of my life, my biggest hobby and I am in no rush in getting a family anytime soon. 

&#x200B;

IF you really struggle finding other hobbies just try stuff out you can do at home 

I have depression, 2022 was the worst year of my life (almost ended it) and to get myself at least a bit out of this shithole I started making music, as a complete beginner with no knowledge whatsoever. 

Its super hard but the reward when I keep doing it for some years is fucking worth it for me

2.) Square is definitely not a primary focus right now, as I am debt free, my job pays me a decent wage, and my living situation is stable and acceptable.

I spend a solid majority of my days pressing X, but here and there, pressing Circle is just downright enjoyable.

As you get older, and as the video game industry changes, they begin to lose the magic that was mostly noticeable when you're young and easily addicted to shit. It's nice to go out and enjoy nature, explore hobbies, and learn something new. But i also love it when i randomly decide to pick up the Joy-Cons after having not touched them for months and get re-addicted to Animal Crossing. Or forgetting that you made a new character in Elden Ring and attempting to beat Malenia for the 100th time. Video games will always hold a special place in my heart, ever since the first time i played A Link to the Past in 1997."

1: Starting a family isn't something you could do in one day. You have to be 1000% sure that you're able to do it. You need a strong and working relationship. Do you really wish the best for your children? Or you want them to grow up in a family full of problems?

2: The same goes for the job thing. It takes time. I had to change 4 jobs before finding the right one.

3: Be happy... are you kidding right? Everyone finds happiness in a different way, some people struggle more, some less. But what makes ME happy won't probably make YOU happy.  
And the point is the same. Happiness is not something you'll find in a day. You have to know yourself.

Also... if I play a game that doesn't interest me, I get instantly bored i and I uninstall It.

They made me miserable, everyone pro made me want to play harder and better but it was just a very large time sink that ultimately made me mostly unhappy.

I have up wholly on those, and will no longer let myself play them.
I now only really play FFXIV for raiding (savage & Ultimate) with a static and have a backlog list I have categorised and spend my Friday and Saturday nights playing them.
I stick to 1 game and don't move on until I determine I don't like it enough to finish or I have finished it.
I really don't play much outside of that.
I'm 29, have a mortgage and want to have kids so I did a bit of work to make sure my life balance was healthy.

I don't reckon many people will quite understand this part but whilst I don't game as much as I used to, I actually found that mentally I was able to gamify online shopping and really enjoy it.
It kind of made me feel like all the time I spent gaming wasn't useless after all.
I started learning all the hidden tricks and tools that are available to everyone that you don't really know about it until you do a bit of research.

I tend to subconsciously make a game of it, find something I want and see how big a discount I can get and how many reward points etc I can stack per purchase.
I realised that since I've been gaming for so long *im really fucking good at it* and applying that mindset to something that provides me a useful, tangible benefit makes it feel so much better."

Dead Space taught me how to be scared shitless, and wanna keep being scared shitless.

I forget the exact quote, and who said it, but something along the lines of “I hated scary games because they were scary. Now, I know how to make scary games.” This rings so true for me, and my love for horror and sci-fi is just a loving concoction for this game.

I hope it’s a love letter and not a cash-grab; of all games, this game deserves some love!"

When I came back to it, I SWEPT through it. I don't even know why I had gotten stuck in the first place!
