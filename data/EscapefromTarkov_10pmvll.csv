21Ravage,How could you tell they not scavs so easily? Is the clothing that distinguishable?
thedrizztman,"Man, I roll up on a party like that and all 3 of them  spin and head, eyes me in sequence. I don't understand where you get into lobbies like this."
AxTROUSRxMISSLE,"Where the fuck do you guys find the deaf, blind and dumb club? All I find are the juiced fat kids snorting cheeto dust and get mauled like Riley Reids asshole on a Saturday"
Runb4its2late,"""Average"" ..  Yea I've never had this situation in the years I've played"
straight_lurkin,Balls deep in fucking scav loot lmao
_McCall_,you we're probably invisible bugged on their end so you made zero audio walking up or firing
NabuBot,Damn prob the invisible bug
rusthd,Bro said exactly what I was thinking
WeCouldDoBetter,paid actors
jnmann,99% chance OP had invisibility bug
Driver2900,I can imagine all 3 of them probably thought the other 2 had it covered. Probably though the walking sounds was one of them as well.
majorbeefy130130,Invisibility bug is ruining the game worse then cheaters atm like bsg plz
FDSTCKS,"Ah, but when i scav they're stealthy ninjas with laser beam rifles and bionic sight"
DWLKJR,Is that you butthead?
Traditional-Monk4098,You foooooooorrrrrr sure got reported
CenterCenterPolitik,"Right before someone comes to reddit and says ""Got killed by another invisible hacker again today. I can't believe people are ok with the state of the game right now. Bsg needs to do something"""
MulderGotProbed,"Yep, OP was invisible. 100%."
CoughItUp22,Just poor lil Tim Tims. That was a war crime.
SneedDeez,"Invisible bug.

Nikita can suck a fat one."
Batmanfan_alpha,"Are those... players? 

Like, real life human beings?"
extaz93,"Shit, if it was on my servers, i'd have got \[head,eyes\] from 150m. Where do you find these kind of goblins ?"
TimBilliet,"""average pmc"" , is wearing an untar helmet lol"
KingSwank,"""hurrdurr u mustve been invisible""

no, I can absolutely promise you that there are people this dumb in Tarkov. look at their gear, they're absolute noobs. it's not that weird for a group of noobs to have poor communication."
overwatchlap,"Two explanations:

\- You are playing on the secret LVNDMARK server  
\- Paid actors"
Brain_Status,John Cena plays Tarkov?
flaxon_,"""There's three of us. We don't need to set security, nobody is gonna step up on a 3-man."""
Qnasher,Bro I bet that was some DELICIOUS scav karma
PlannedOrphan,to be honest you were probably invisible to them soo this clip is more bug then skill issue
LaptopQuestions123,"You were invisible. Very common bug right now. Think people wouldn't turn towards close range gunfire? Probably just got 3 reports and they will swear they were wiped by a cheater.

Hell they may post a vid here..."
Microkorgdeluxe,No way you aint invis lol
Travilcopter,Excuse me but WHAT I'm always put up against a t1000 terminator. You also could have been invisible!!!!!!
DevilJabanero,"OP forsure invisible, even the dumbest of apes would start doing SOMETHING when getting lit up like that. Not saying op is a bug abuser or anything, as from what I gather this glitch happens because of fucking horrible servers (I really dunno tho could be different this time, but back when this happened before it was due to immense desync) and OP probably had 0 control of knowledge of their invisibility. Just wondering though is this on a scav or were you pmc?"
nomafiainmycity,You where invisible prob.
JiffTheJester,"Ah the invisible bug, can‚Äôt wait to see their pov lol"
austinvf82,Where can i find noobs like this üòÇ I'm getting nothing but ultra chads lately
boggerbret,"It‚Äôs amazing how if you just don‚Äôt Shift W everywhere, people some people truly aren‚Äôt paying that much attention."
Amplar,"it looks like he was having the invisible bug, they never even looked at OP"
btd1992,"Can confirm ole mallard here is not a cheater lol, in fact complete ass 99.9% of the time. Ducky is you see comment learn to listen to calls dick! Stop the TKs"
DownLake,EU server head eyes as soon as you take one step - US shoot 2 teammates in head doesn't react
LooMinairy,I didn't realise napolean dynamite played this game lol
iedy2345,"YOu might have been invisible, it doenst seem like any of them react , even the 3rd guy doesnt react to the gunshots even tho they were right on him and his 2 teammates just got clapped, probably cause there were no gunshot sounds for him."
TheBigZamboni85,You're 100% invisible to these guys. Died under similar circumstances in a raid where my duo was also invisible. Sucks but that's tarkov right now. Seems to happen on interchange more than other maps
ImBackYetAgainBitch,Why your tarkov looks so ps3?
V_Energy,100% abusing invisible glitch here
Cortex32,You were probably invisible to them. Happens a lot lately
YeetMemez,The ‚Äúwhat the fuuuck‚Äù at the end had me in stitches.
crimsonBZD,"Judging how they had to have seen you, and they didn't react when you shot, I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess you were invisible and didn't know it."
eddyxx,Average US server gameplay
WasephWastar,"they knew you were there, they just assumed you were one of their squad member.

Because why would a ennemi walk to you without shooting. that's what they must be thinking."
scubapig567,"Yesterday i was scavving and i shot a pmc, he just looked at me, turned back around and kept going on his way. Free loot for me i guess?"
spoderman63,Me and my friends when we have a full squad
RecordAway,dudes been on noscreen challenge
LongGirthyVeiny,Wow what are these graphics? These Waters reflections? What are your specs?
DukeLander,I bet you were reported as cheater...
KayNynYoonit,Meanwhile I get head eyes immediately from a dude that saw a pixel of me across the map in 2 nanoseconds lol
Zer0_Logic,This is why I tell my mates to stream
Janitor_,They gotta be bambi's
forstyy,What server? I need some enemies like this...
pti4ka1488,"One time I played on shoreline with two mates, we spawned at PTL and wanted to go to Resort even if it‚Äôs a bad spawn. Both of them gone through the woods behind the ruin with the dead scav inside. I was heading to cottage as that is our standard procedure, always going via cottage to resort/electric/gas station. So I entered the wheat field and in front of me like 5 meters two guys I thought would be my mates running to cottage. Only mid field I realized that they are not my friends after they spinned on me. I lost an expensive kit, but I was laughing my ass off just like my mates did.

So I ran about 30-40 meters together with guys I didn‚Äôt know."
luton2468,u/savevideo
Mr_M3Gusta_, Could be due to the interface bug from the other day that made looting hella loud.
SactoriuS,"Hahaha, just light walking triggers no one in the team. Epic video of the tarkov life.

And i know how it goes: ""Hey man, this guy has a gasanalyzer that u needed"", so the last guy also starts to loot. xD"
luciferx95,The guy who went to loot last simply just wasn't looking. He was to busy worried his buddy would take all the good loot and was staring down at the body and not in the direction of op like he should have been. Audio wise simply could be they just didn't hear him cause of any number of reasons we all know all to well or they thought it was one of them.
Adventurous-Ad6850,"Looks like scav mains tried to go on a pmc run that day, it didn't go well..."
HaidenFR,Tunnnn Tiiinnnnnnnnnnnn
WhatATunt,"I walked up on a PMC hiding in a container on big red on customs and managed to basically have my shotgun barrel touching the side of his head. I even waited for him to kill an AI scav to make sure he hadn't like disconnected from the raid or something

I don't think it can be overstated how fucked the audio can be on top of how nonchalant a lot of normal players are"
Zer0Cyber_YT,Hope you got 20min left on that raid timer to loot all their shit
Kiralyka94,Wish it was this easy sometimes
stelkurtainTM,And they'll come on here to complain about cheaters too
Dani_vic,You seemed offended by their inability to fight you
Backdoor_Delivery,Thick scav about to extract emercom
Money-Communication3,You‚Äôd think this far into wipe‚Äôs people would stop asking where Timmy and his friends are every raid
killerallen0703,Help I am in this video and don't like it
lolulysse007,all of them looting bodies makes me think of flies
Htimez2,"I never get lobbies like that, not once lol."
Towel4,"Ah, invisible 

Very fun and stable game üëç"
Llmpjesus,"This is not even remotely what my average experience with enemy PMC is like, like not even in the same ballpark."
joe2105,This is why I stress to my friends that after a fight only one of us loots at a time.   Lol
Odd-Pick7512,You were 100% invisible bugged to them. They didn't even stop looting when their first man died.
LittleEavan,u/savevideo
Mainiak_,"He could of stayed until the end of a raid and pretend to be a player scav, I found most people that jump into scav raids are usually friendly and unconcerned about each other"
Electrical-Reindeer4,"Maybe you were invisible, and they couldn't hear you"
PureRushPwneD,"Ah yes, tunnel visioning 3 man squad.. very quick to just assume the steps you're hearing is one of your teammates, especially if you're not using screenshare"
SnorinMac,Op def had the invisible bug.
Hungry-Opening-420,They cant see or hear you - are you cheating?
boothwilkes,Ran Factory duos yesterday. I need my PMC pistol kills. We got rushed by another duo. Killed one. My partner could not see or hear the other one even though he was right up on us blasting.
HotFaithlessness9317,"I didnt know of an invisibility bug, but if its true that makes a ton more sense, I was so confused myself on how they didnt see me, but i assumed because all of them were under level 8 that it was their first wipe and were really just that clueless"
smashbro188,"No ears, big group, probably making too much noise on VC and didn't hear you walking up"
BeefyZealot,Likely no sound
coxamad,that's probably me and my mates
PckMan,3 is the magic number for the worst possible squad play. It's very easy to lose track of your mates or assume the sound of someone walking is just one of them. At least with a duo you know that you only have the one friend and he's either left or right from you.
Noodle_-_-,You were for sure invisible. Had this happen to me the other day. I was a PMC and took a shot with no bullet sound or walking near me. Then I walked around the corner and started using meds. After a couple of seconds I start grunting hard and bleeding fast and died. I died to a scav that was completely invisible.
AssumedSectionID,Average? My avg pmc knows exactly where I am at without moving and gets some sort of headshot in one shot every other raid.
Rawries186,"Man, and here I am Lv8 just starting the wipe late and every fuck in customers has 856a1 troopers and three friends. Bro I just want my pocket watch."
Neker07,How tf did you upload a clip? it says i cant upload clips when i try
MaXa_5,"His gun is like apex devotion lmg, the more he shoots the faster it gets lmao"
kaibtw,ScAvS Shouldn't Spawn tIl haLf RAiD /s
0Cruze,Where do you pull those Paid Actors from?
SignalHamster,"If sound was in any way shape or form working i would go along with the chuckle here but as is they probably expected to hear something. then again one guys wearing a blue untar helm so chances are theres some newness in that group.


usually you hope one out of the group of 3 would cover for the others looting but sometimes the need and greed kicks in and mistakes are made."
enigma-90,"I hate to break it to you, but there's an invisible bug going around. You never know."
Affectionate-Gap-860,You were invisible for them
sw33t-tea1er,"This Might be that invisible scav bug, it‚Äôs been happening lately you won‚Äôt hear ai or player scav movements or gunshots so u just start taking damage and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening. Or not maybe their just not paying attention, But either way gg free loot hehe."
shroomdoom88,Yeah there‚Äôs alotta newbies just feeding themsleves to me this wipe lmao
VoidSythe,Has no one seriously considered that you probably just have the invistible scav glitch?
Alarming_Ad4314,Playing as a Scav killing other scavs you feel like a big boy now OP? You‚Äôre really big boy aren‚Äôt you
stoicyeoman,"No the average tarkov player it's head, eyes in that situation"
Marcusbellic,I only get chads with mdr/m61
Oniondice342,Gotta love the zero footstep sounds for scavs bug.
djn808,all 3 looting with their heads down. no one on guard duty. lmfao.
SnooDingos45,dude hownstly i dont even blame them for not seeing him but i bet the game was just bugged. and i bet the scav was invisible to them so they just died outta no where
onrocketfalls,That was silly but I'm still just over here salty that that one dude's helmet tanked four shots before he went down
Affectionate_Gas_264,Average non-hacking players üòÜüòÇ
Made_Account,lol why do you sound so pissed after that?
hiholuna,"As someone on the grenadier quest, I see a big missed opportunity"
Master2All,Running in squads is annoying as fuck if you don't have someone designated to watch while looting others loot.
preyforkevin,"I‚Äôve never had an experience like this in the game‚Ä¶ever. Once a pmc had disconnected and I killed that pmc, but never anything remotely like this."
Gullible_Reply,Scav player is invisible. Nothing to see here. Dogshit BSG at work again.
Insanity8016,"There's an invisible bug going around, it is possible you were just invisible to them. Not to mention the complete dogshit audio. It is also entirely possible that they are just braindead."
MaezinGaming,"I spawned in invisible on a scav run, some could see me others couldn‚Äôt"
cmsmasherreddit,How did they not notice you?
squidelvis,"I hope they leaned from their mistake, few players never loot one body."
Shmelk,3 man all looting at the same time with no lookout. Gotta love it
ItzHubris,This is the plus side of being a scav with such high negative rating‚Ä¶ I know which scav are AI and which aren‚Äôt. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Seanyboy2793,This guy gets 3 kills from clueless PMCs meanwhile I get one tapped from Mosin man from 150m+ üòÇ
OperationTrue6891,2pmcs looting one scav? bruh they deserve to die
clrksml,You're invisible.
xFreiSx,Dude bugged out and running invincible not gg
Zazi_Kenny,"If he had an ultrawide he woulda saw you, I love my ultrawide"
kchunpong,How come these guys not yet uninstall their game?
TheRealL3,Been a lot of invisible people lately including my own teammates.
Dzusitomato,I think you might have been invisible to them
Psychological-Monk30,"just based on the third guy not moving for a solid 3 seconds but start moving instantly when you shot him aka he took dmg i call invisible bug.

There's no way he didn't move at all on the first  8 shot on his teammate being this close to him but he instant stop looting at the first bullet he receive."
acaerus,He was invisible?
noahsark02,How dumb to show everyone you are using the invisibility cheat.
feeok331,100% invisible bug and they thought he was under. Guy looks right at him and doesn‚Äôt react. Congratulations on your Nikita come up.
DelugeFPS,"Given the absolute trash tier gear they were running, I'd say these guys probably spawned in as hatchlings or pistolings and tried to go for some low risk easy loot.

&#x200B;

You did god's work."
shroomdoom88,Yeah there‚Äôs alotta newbies just feeding themsleves to me this wipe lmao
EagleLeft5225,"Yesterday I went into the Woods bunker for the quest. Both pmcs looting, I stand in front of them. They don't even realize.

Finally one stops looting. I am shaking my camera not to get shot ...and the dude shoots me. 

Wish I had a bag of nades lol."
ChronoHvH,"OP was definitely invisible, weird glitch rn where when you load into a raid your raid code is off by like 1 digit and to the rest of the server you're invisible. A friend of mine killed a group of juicers because of this, stared in his direction and everything just to not shoot at all.

I doubt it was a sound thing because that one dude running up not only would have heard him but also saw him walking in the open like that."
Omisco420,Probably invisible
DarthWeenus,Yo how you get so lucky haha. I usually get domed from a mile away.
MandiocaGamer,Americans servers be like...
