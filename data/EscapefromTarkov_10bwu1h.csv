Hatetotellya,Remember! if you shoot a streamers blacked out legs you too can never see your account again with no recourse and get to be insulted by thousands of chats on twitch!
bigred1978,"If you're a Twitch/Youtube streamer then that is all you are.  Game publishers/studios should not have to offer you anything or adhere to any demands you may make about gameplay.  It's simply unethical and dishonest.

I'm just a low-level player and probably don't play enough to ever get really high up there but now I have to worry about that one opportune moment in the game where I'll get the best of some well-kitted PMC someday and think: ""Gosh, I'm scared, what if he was some streamer or something?  Will I find out that I'm banned in a few hours?""

Like, how and why would anyone playing even have that thought run through their mind?  How nuts has the situation deteriorated that someone can't simply play in peace and, god forbid, have fun?"
Vinddictive_,Your right streamers shouldn’t be able to hit up a dev and ban someone. Shits so dumb and unfair
The_Corrupted,"Nah man, I'm with you. As a community we can not accept stuff like this happening. You can not have some manchild who has pull with BSG get people banned, because his ego can't take an L. This shit could happen to all of us, if that ""person"" is allowed to continue like that"
Vargg-,"I don't like how he double downed and feels he did nothing wrong. The whole thing doesn't sit right with me. It's sad that instead of being the bigger person, and using their streamer dollars to right the wrong they caused, the normal dude just gets shafted and the streamer gets a pat on the back from their socially conditioned chat. :c"
lb_poleStar,"The worst of all this is that BSG didn't say anything *(and probably won't say anything)*, the poor guy who killed rengawr is still banned and rengawr is streaming 7 hours of Tarkov... 

Rengawr doesn't even think about what he did, as if it was totally normal to do a fast report *(that normal users doesn't have access to)* where the guy has big chances of getting banned, he did this multiple times and he knows perfectly what he did there.

This hole situation is just unveliavable, the dude is still f\* streaming tarkov and he doesn't even see what he did is just so wrong *(and he did this more than once)*, and to top all of this bs the guy is still banned, seriously wtf is up with BSG?"
TheFlabbs,"What upsets me most about it is the message that it sends. Streamers are very lucky to be in the position they’re in - they spend eight hours of their day in the comfort of their own homes and get paid for it, and yet there are normal people with normal lives who spend $40-140 on this game on the impression that they’ll be able to pick up and play whenever they want in the free time that they have

The very idea that these two groups can clash and that one’s say is above the other’s is EXTREMELY problematic for the longevity of this game, I mean really nobody wants to feel lesser than just because they aren’t monetizing the time they spend playing this game. I bet everyone is just a little more nervous of killing a streamer now, and that god forbid doing so doesn’t add up on the streamer’s end. You’ll just get banned. That monetization helps the streamer AND BSG and yet as a result, the average player gets the shaft. **The average players are lower on the totem pole of prioritization. Fuck that. I’ve never seen anything like that in all my time playing games**

I work to earn my money, and some fucking nerd’s opinion shouldn’t play a role in whether or not I get to keep the product I paid for - yet apparently all it takes is one of them dialing up their developer buddy to pull the switch. Talk about complete and total power tripping. Rengawr can’t just keep ignoring this lol, dude fucked up so bad. His own words are that he’ll get someone banned in ten minutes - **the fact that this is something he even feels comfortable throwing out there** is a HUGE problem!"
BigDickBaller93,"We still havnt gotten an address from before Xmas when the developer banned the guy who killed him, I wouldnt hold my breath for a response"
Enough-Monk-636,"You know what, I commend yah. I think it's time the Tarkov silent majority player base finally shows BSG that all players need to be treated equally and be given the same chances and rights as any other player regardless of status. The self-righteous ""oligarchs"" in the Tarkov community need to realize they are no better/privileged than anyone else who owns and plays this game and should be taken off their pedestals and have to wait in line like the rest of us when there's a problem."
secret_name_is_tenis,Fuck that nerd
IntrinsicTrout,"If you’re still not convinced that BSG caters everything to streamers, just look at the absurd number of streamer items. I feel like half the shit I find is some special streamer item. Think of how much time and effort went into making and incorporating all of those items into the game. Time that didn’t go into fixing audio, netcode issues, optimization, etc. They don’t care about the average player, they care about “influencers”."
furrybass,A small tight knit community? This game made 100 MILLION dollars last year.

Murb08,u/Rengawrlol raging man child.
srirachajames,Havent logged in at all since this happened. I know theres hackers in this game but i do not stand for this. Call it a waste of 40 but the tarkov community has helped me sm in learning the game and whilst i have nothing to show for it i will stand in solidarity. Godspeed gentlemen and women.

IanMinch,"So 3 months ago you were on your first wipe and now you have played for 6?   


I agree about Rengawr. But you my friend are lying your ass off just to stir some drama up and karma whore.   


Fuck off. Honestly."

KingfisherC,Deleted by mods? lmao
wyrrk,"That guy has now permabanned future fans too, if you're think about it. anytime his name comes up it will be in the pejorative. Not because he made a decision in haste and without thoughtful consideration for its consequences, but because when confronted with the opportunity to own his mistake and reparate he chose to selfishly flaunt the privilege which he feels entitled too. Yeah, BSG is obviously flawed, but this aint my first rodeo. On some level catering to streamers when you got a beta product makes financial sense so they're incentivized to do so, but at the same time BSG is a victim of that thing too. They need the advertising that streamers bring and rely on the honesty and integrity of those streamers to make their product look good.   


This particular streamer just burned the community AND BSG in the process.   


Fuck that guy."
Gekks101,People are so mad over this dumb shit that they are falling for this bait thread. Check the guys post history. Reddit gonna reddit
Defuzzygamer,"Nope fuck that. I'm with you. It's absolute horse shit that he said ""don't worry he'll be banned in 10 minutes"" but is now claiming he doesn't have any say or influence if someone he reports gets banned. He sent the clip and raid ID in. He was malicious about it.

The even more fucked thing is that this shows how little the rest of the player base means to BSG. You or I wouldn't receive the same reaction from BSG/BattleEye if we sent them a clip of a death caused by a player who we deem suspicious. Yet the influence from one of Tarkovs bigger streamers/content creators is immediately recognised and they appease the streamer even without clearing the case by making sure Rengawrs killer is or isn't cheating. It goes to show that there are separate rules for them and us."

weird."
GunkyDabs,"Nah man im w  ya, thats really fucked if theres no foul play with that account. Id be livid."
Leytarkhan,"I am with you not only because of a reason like that but the state of the game aswell.

Cheaters not being banned even with proof, name etc., people being falsely banned because a streamer said that he was a cheater, scavs being immortal crack maschines with aimbot, hit reg being a joke, performance lackluster, sound etc.

I have been playing for 8 wipes and this is by far the worst state this game has ever been in. Sure the other wipes had their own problems but they were manageable it never felt like I was being unfairly killed. 

I unloaded  8 magnum buckshot into some players face today point blank I might add and he did not die he had the ""green penis helm"" on and it got registered as 450 armor damage and 350 flesh damage.

I am just not enjoying my time or how BSG goes about their game anymore so I deinstalled the game for the first time ever."
Nice_Lingonberry_764,"Add HyperRatTV to that list as well. Banned for expressing a difference in opinion in his chat. I don’t watch either of them or support them because HyperRatTV seems like a whiny crying baby, that attempts to speak in Ebonics and acts like he is a hard gangster but is really annoying and whines and complains as well. Really don’t like watching assholes on twitch. Screw the EFT small streamers. Watch JayBayBay, Pestily and Lvndmark, there’s a lot of good EFT streamers. Let’s just use our viewership and support somewhere else. Let them be, we will watch elsewhere, their loss not ours."
Brave-Damage8508,"Well said, l'm done with it as well. Rengawr has at least let the bulk of players see what many have known for a long time regarding streamers and their relationship with BSG. They are a toxic bunch all of them...."
MagicTwilight,is a shame im not a streamer too so i could insta ban every xing\_guao69 and Guang\_xi241 that kills me
SAKilo1,"Everyone just report rengwar on twitch for bullying and harrasment. If they get like 3k reports, yah know"
Headbanger203,"Ah, BSG continuing to do terrible things and refusing to admit any fault? It's not the first time, hopefully this guy gets his account back but damn makes you think about how many people have been falsely banned and conned out of their game because someone got mad.

I would say the solution would be to remove the ability to manually ban but BSG runs less like a company and more like a CSS community. Yes I know the thread is about some guy I frankly don't care about that reported him but at the end of the day, it's BSG that holds most of the fault for allowing it to be a thing to begin with. How long ago was it when the dev banned a guy because he died, a month? Two?"
SecondSoulless,"Also fun to remember that they balance the game around specifically Rengawr and how fast he blows through everything. Alot of the changes to make the game more grindy were done specifically with him in mind (as he would max traders days and have kappa in like, a week or two)

All of that for just some internet prick. Its lame. Hate BSGs practices"
lonelyscrublord,Rengawr isn’t the core issue it’s listening to every streamer who calls cheats without investigation of any kind. I got fea day two and there was a guy selling 20+gpu and ledx. It’s clear to everyone but bsg can’t or won’t do anything about it
SlavDawg,Fuck (almost all) streamers and BSG listening to streamer more than their community! Came back to game after almost 2 years of brake just to see fuck all has changed. And now this issue of player getting banned because streamer got TARKOVED. Fuck the game is not even in proper finished state to be banning people for no reason.
wardearth13,I highly doubt they’ll be publicly remedying this issue. I heard onepeg bought the victim a new copy. So at least that’s something.

leiroux,yeah i am worried for even playing this game normally since it hasn't even been that long (only last month ago) since the last incident of two of the devs getting killed by another legit guy then rage banning him. this was also covered by onepeg (https://youtu.be/5phjvXQdjAo)

heresyyy,"Agreed, what an absolute fanny. Something needs to be done."
roflwafflelawl,"I hope some people understand where I'm coming from when I say that this whole issue isn't even Rengawrs fault. 

Employees of BSG or any game company should not be giving any content creator any form of pull. They should be thinking of content creators as free advertisement and nothing more; well unless sponsored or hiring the content creator (publicly) as part of the team. 

Devs should look at the community as a whole for feedback, not select individuals to represent it. It's as if BSG thinks these streamers are free community managers. 


Now of course it's Rengawr (amongst many others I'm sure) who might be directing where to aim but it's the devs like BSG who are not only providing the weapon but also pulling the trigger."

TyraelmxMKIII,"this is exactly the reason why i stopped playing. like where tf is my incentive to play a game thousands of hours just to get banned by a streamer too eventually with no evidence besides their shitty servers.

HUNDarkTemplar,"""especially in a small, tight-knit community"" In what world is Tarkov a small community?   


And what solidarity? You dont do any favor to anyone for not playing the game. If you like the game play, if not, dont play, but dont stop playing the game out of ""morality"" or whatever. You already bought the game, wheter you keep playing or not, BSG doesnt care.  


You stopping playing the game, doesnt help the victims of this issue and It doesnt harm BSG at anyrate, Its simply just not a good way of rebelling or strike action."

streamlined_penguin,Slow down Gandhi
raar__,I dont know why he even though he was cheating. He only got shot like 10 times before he died
omgwtfsmhlol,"If you still enjoyed the game you wouldn't, or you're just virtue signalling."
Certain-Mulberry9893,"Ok, while I agree that it’s stupid what happened, I HONESTLY blame bsg more than Rengawr. Yes, while he (toxically) reported a player directly to bsg after he got killed by an offscreen desynced player which was weird for sure but def not a “banned in 10 mins” weird, Rengawr never actually  banned the player who killed him. In the end, bsg devs are the ones who saw the report from a notable streamer and decided to ban without any extra data or review. 

I feel like the fact that streamers have a direct link to bsg is kinda fair tho, if used properly, cause they play the most and therefore will run into the most cheaters. I just think that bsg needs to review all reports fairly, no matter who reported it. 

Also, this subreddit is renown for its cheater accusations, even without video proof. People need to realize that Rengawr reacted how a large portion of this subreddit would if they had a direct link to bsg; like a man child who couldn’t manage to get his way so he reports it.

In the end, whatever happened happened. Rengawr def isn’t clean, cause he also knew what he was doing I.e reporting someone who wasn’t blatantly cheating through a direct line to bsg knowing that would increase the odds of that person being banned just due to the fact that Rengawr reported him. But bsg should def be reviewing all reports the same way, no matter who sent the report."
HoneyFuk,Dude needs to get off his power trip.
Deschutes_PaleAle,Think when developers ban you its like a SQL delete execution. Even if he gets his account back (which I doubt) it will be a  level 0 account.

AspectCurious,"Love the karma posting. Guy said this was his 6th wipe it is actually his 6th, and he is unlikely to be a fan of Rengawr. I also like all the people stating they have been killed by the streamer and he said he would get them banned. Is this witch hunt literally to karma farm?"
TimmahBinx,"Yeah, this on top of everything else I just don’t have the time or patience for this bullshit anymore. The rengawr thing was just the straw that broke the camels back for me. Maybe next year I’ll re-install."

NammiSjoppan,Yeah this situation is fucked
LoneCentaur95,"If you enjoy the game, just play it. It’s not like you pay a subscription price so stopping just means they got your money and don’t have any strain on the servers from you."
TherealPadrae,There needs to be a investigation into the ban and whether the game was checked and the player was checked. It could be that rengr got lucky and reported a very sneaky cheater. We don’t know with absolute certainty that the other guy isn’t a cheater even though there’s not much to suggest he is based on what we have seen. If the player could show his perspective killing the streamer then we could fully trust him. Bsg needs to investigate whether he’s a hacker and if they already did and banned him from evidence they found then they need to let us know.

MoonBoy2DaMoon,"I feel like everyone is overlooking the fact that he showed a clip AND the guy was the one who got banned said he would have reported himself too. Either way you look at it, it a BSG problem and less a Rengawr problem"
Dyils,"I see a lot of hate for this guy and while it's correct to assign some blame to him, I think the biggest responsibility is held by Tarkov. Gamers and streamers will always blame anything but themselves. But no matter what he says to the game admins, they shouldn't just automatically listen to him. So while he screwed up, BSG screwed up 10x more. How can you just ban a player cause some guy told you to? What the fuck?"
BarmeloXanthonii,"its not even that either bro its the fact that he said in a clip that because all this talk he is gaining More views & even a better contract opportunity on top of the viewers that are donating to him & at the same time shit talking their OWN chat these streamers have big EGOs bro its cringe asf .  
they can not take a loss without blaming it being a cheater either"

FilthyPeasant_Red,"This post is so fake lmao, redditors are so gullible.

OP said ""It looks like quitting after last wipe was a great choice"" 5 days ago. So he's just karma whoring."
CorvusEffect,"There's no proof that Rengawr even got him banned (though it is likely that he did, and it probably would have happened without the clip submission anyway). The guy outright says that he had information that someone who isn't cheating should not have, in his post on Reddit. The guy provides zero proof that he wasn't cheating, and we don't know if he was engaging in RMT or Carries,  or not. Hell, even if he wasn't cheating, he could have been banned for cheating in the past, and when you get banned for cheating, even circumventing a ban by owning a new account is a ban-able offense, even if you stop cheating.

It's highly likely that BSG reviewed his account, realized he was cheating, or had cheated in the past, banned him, and now you're all coming to his aid with no proof. As for Rengawr, I gaurentee every single person on this sub, has reported people for way less."

silentrawr,"Totally agree we should organize and do something to protest this pissant little bullshit that (the streamer we're talking about) pulled the other day.

Skyler663,Guys streamers cant get anyone banned. They submit clips to community managers that submit that to battle eye.
beyer0101,"Do u guys even think the developers have the ability to watch a reported players live or old gameplay?? Or do they just make the calls based on suspicions?? We as players, should never fkn fear getting banned when we’re not cheating tf?? I used 4 bullets in a raid today and got three headshots on high level players with iron sight sks. Best play i’ve ever done. Instead of being proud/happy i’m just worried i’ll get the boot. No game should ever be like this wtf..?"
aranu8,"I don't really have a problem with streamers getting special treatment, it sucks if they abuse it but I'm kinda ok with it. They help promote the game, sorta. My biggest issue is how can they just blindly ban someone? Did they do it because they trust the streamer? Or were they lazy? Or more concerning do they even have a way of checking? My money is on the latter, they prob have no way to do anything, and when we click the report button it prob does nothing, why else do we see cheaters never getting banned?"
