evoxbeck,They shouldn't also be able to head eyez you through five hundred trees.. Sick of that bull
noobgiraffe,It's comical with rogues on lighthouse. As BEAR you look at them through scope 200m away by only poping half your face from behind a rock and you instantly eat lead from full auto iron sighted MG.
Susman22,I don’t even understand this mechanic? Is it to make scavs harder? Because I just don’t see a reason for this to exist.
CapeChill,I was once trying to do shooterborn sitting on the hill at gas on shoreline. Sanitar spawned at lighthouse and while I must've been to far for him to engage when i went over his head with my 6x he snapped to me and stayed that way until a pmc ran down the road 10 minutes later. Creepy as hell!
PoloHusky,"Last night, 3 raids, night raids with silencer at distance. Head eyes by rogue I shot at from like 200 meters as he strafes and full autos. Get run up on in a bush two more times by ai scavs for no reason and head eyes. I took a break after that. It's insane."
AchokingVictim,"Not to mention then if you kill the scav and loot them they've got some 47 durability AK with no stock or rear sight, but they were making like 170 meter shots with it"
Scavwithaslick,Every AI in this game is so aids
FinnenHawke,"As a new player, this absolutely surprised me. 

I went to Woods with my more experienced friend; she was doing some quest where she had to kill scavs with a shotgun. Since I'm still learning the game, I just proned between a tree and a huge rock (on the opposite side of the scav house) and looked through my red dot towards the northern side (a little bit left to the road). In the distance, far behind a damaged car (I think), at the edge of the treeline, I saw a scav patrolling. I could barely see him, but he was definitely there and looking somewhere to the side. I was pointing at him and told my friend where he is, so she could run there and blast him with a shotty. 

Then it happened.

I just saw his posture changing in a fraction of a second and then I saw a green tracer flying towards my head from like 250 or 300 meters. I guess he didn't like having a stalker. xD

What a joke :D"
Fictitious1267,"Totally agree. They overtune them because they can't program their AI better. And for some reason they want Scavs not to be cannon fodder recently, even though that's literally what they are supposed to be. I think they honestly forget their own initial vision, and just want to watch streamers die, even if the game is worse off for it for everyone else."
hiddencamela,"I HATE when they crouch spam to dodge shots.  
I watched my friend shoot at one, and everytime he flicked to the head, the scav would crouch then stand."
LinkinBreak,"I believe that the scavs detect you when you aim at them if you're using a scope because the Picture in Picture is effectively a camera much closer to them. So they're detecting that camera and that camera is attached to you. Which they shouldn't be detecting at all, but it's been that way for years now.

If they're detecting you with iron sights or red dots, that I'm not sure of what would cause that. But I agree that if their detect rage is, for example 100meters, and we're 150 meters away, they shouldn't know we exist unless we miss our shots, no matter the sight we're aiming at them with."
SageHamichi,Sniper scav killed me head eyes 3x today on shoreline through bushes.... at night....
Yetiplayzskyrim,"They can smell you, that's why I bath in scav piss."
HonorableAssassins,"Ive heard of this issue for years, and seen a few clips, but ive honestly never experienced it first hand. I play mostly sniper/dmr style and track scavs until i have a clear headshot, and ive never had one magicdetect me out of nowhere.

I have seen it in clips, but i think its a bug, not a mechanic, personally. Unless BSG has ever claimed otherwise that im not aware of?"
KingzLegacy,I love getting clapped by a scav on the MG while I'm in crack. Happened twice today fml.
TheDreadedNorsk,"Clapped a pmc, got all his gear, a m4a1 with m856a1 made my way around shoreline to the bunker and a random so scav walks out the bumper I shoot him with a few controlled bursts to the upper thorax and head. He doesn’t die. I shoot again, he returns fire, I end up dumping the whole mag on him just to get killed wearing level 4 helmet and level 5 armor. Lost everything to god scavs. Where should I send in the video lmao"
BertBerts0n,Thats the realism tarkov strives for!
Pikatron321,"They should just have a vision cone in front of them. They should move occasionally and thats it. Patrol around sometimes.

Raiders should constantly be on alert, looking around a lot spotting players in a cone again.

&#x200B;

It surely cant be hard to make decent AI that work as they should be expected to work. 

Scavs = not tactical / not combat proficient

Raiders = tactical / communicate well / heavily combat profiacient.

&#x200B;

What I also hate is player scavs loading into raids that have been live for 4 mins.

Lighthouse is a main one... how are player scavs beating me to raider loot lmao."
HaZarD_SFD,"Playing as a scav on reserve, this title is just triggering.  Those fucking raiders sit there and eye fuck the scenery.  I walk up with some shit ass Mosin or VPO with an MMA of 18+ and line up a headshot.  Fuckers run away like the peter tingle in them is just a jingling.    


Listen if they see me then cool, call it a visual spotting system.  However when I aim at the back of a head and they all of a sudden gotta go take a shit, thats downright wrong."
Senior-Solution-4300,"Honestly, scavs aren’t that deadly rn. However I HATE HAVING TO STAPLE MY ARMS BACK ON AFTER EVERY SINGLE SCAV ENCOUNTER USING THEIR STUPID .366 OR 7.62 SO ANNOYING"
Tankeverket,"It's actually 'easy' to fix too.

All you have to do is add an invisible cone in front of them that is used to detect things, if you're not within that cone then they can't see you, simple as that.

Fixes both being able to detect you aiming, and their vision is automatically blocked by objects, meaning they won't see you through trees and such as well."
threwasausernamehere,"Idk man I really don't have this problem, skill issue."
Caesura_Break,"Start expecting it, peek from cover, and as soon as they start moving to react, reposition, fuck off, nade, or get your buddy to agro him. Im tired of it too, but there are ways to deal"
jeff5551,Apparently in the other version of the game who shall not be named you can literally just turn it off lol
SweetyMcQ,Yea Scavs are giga fucked this wipe. Its ridiculous. They also will HARDLOCK trace you through cover and concealment. Its annoying AF. Died more to scavs this wipe then players tbh.
bigtimechip,"I am not even good at the game and I have no trouble with scavs
This isnt cod slow down nitro"
aForgedPiston,"If true, I agree. AI needs some development in the game for sure. We're taking little tiny steps-this wipe, for example, I've noticed them doing lean-peeks around corners. Harder now to tell if I'm coming across scavs or player scavs. And the thing with them shooting through bushes?!?! Yeah, there are problems for sure. 

But I don't think scavs are supposed to be fodder. They're supposed to be locals and (this is in their description) former PMCs with a home field advantage, despite their less than stellar equipment. Which means potentially, you're facing a peer, just with worse gear. They're supposed to be a credible threat. Less so than a fully geared gigachad of course. But a threat nonetheless."
Synchrotr0n,"What I'm tired of are scavs hearing your supressed shots from far away, approaching to investigate, and then imeddiatelly knowing in what bush you are hiding while shooting from behind two layers of trees and bushes."
Signal-Resident2379,"In my experience, not a real thing. Unless you're already in their eyeline, which makes sense."
Themodernweeb,First time aye?
brochochocho,"I think they should maybe like 25% of the time if they’re standing still. 

It can be too easy to kill them when they stand still so I assume that’s the reason for their spidey senses. That or radiation mutations.."
furrybass,"It’s still in beta, can’t complain about these things, when it releases the ai will be amazin."
Last_Ad_6840,5200 Hours played here never witnessed this.
Browncoat765,"Seems realistic to me, same thing happens when I do the same thing to PMCs"
EggYoch,"It's not a mechanic, it's confirmation bias. There is no mechanic for scavs to ""know"" when they're being aimed at. Sometimes they just turn and see you while you're looking at them. If you have LOS on them, they have LOS on you.
(INB4 downvote spam cause this sub likes to run with everything they read online)"
theirongiant74,"Player: Head taps sniper scav from Crackhouse with iron sighted sks.  
AI Scav: Head taps player from 30m after shouting warning.  
Player: This is such bullshit."
eni6ma007,"Lol I had a scav one time 1 tsp me with a TT pistol in west wing resort after I head shot him with m855a1 and my buddy had to kill the scav after then bring my shit out it was the dumbest thing ever 

Yet 99% of other scavs are just retarded lol 

It’s either they are cracked or they are literally bots"
overheadace,"yup lmao, i was night on streets and aimed at sniper scav and he freaken proned as soon as i was looking at his direction."
awa1nut,"Something my friend noticed ads tested is that it's not the at of asking itself that yet can detect,  it's lasers. Try turning them off when hunting scavs offline and see if that does anything"
_Doggmatik,"Idk what kind of scavs you all have been playing with, but I swear they nerfed them to shit.    


They really haven't been able to hit me at all unless I whiff the first 2-3 seconds of engagement.  Sniper scavs even miss at least 2 shots before they 1-2 tap me lol"
Ant10102,I was in crack house in cusoms at night time and a scav shot me through the glass window in the medical room into the hallway where I was standing and one tapped me in the chest with the machine gun from stronghold. Just so happened to bring my best gear 🙃
SipDhit69,"Yup, just happens to be what exists when the AI isnt finished as they stated many times"
idontagreewitu,It's been like this for years. I've got a clip from back probably .10 or even .09 aiming down my eotech at a scav maybe 60m away and as soon as he walks into the ring of the dot he turns right to me and yells.
rubenmart1n,"better AIM than %99 of players. 

OMG dat scavs."
Lukaroast,That would require effort
HumperoLT,"The most annoying thing about AI scavs is that you have to completely go against proper sence of combat and cover. For AI you can't lean peek or do anything, that would be 100% the play against non ai. So having to be like, ok that is AI i have to peek my whole body to not gethead-eyes."
OfreakNwoW1,They all have the high alert perk equipped duhh
Enchantedmango1993,Thats how sanitar killed me  today he didnt notice me amd when i aimed down at him he turned around and deleted me
PckMan,"Scavs either shoot you with laser beam accuracy exactly 1,7 seconds after you hover over them with your sights or they just completely ignore your existence."
Jazzyo3,Are you using a tactical device? They can detect tactical devices even if theyre ir
Midgermis,Time tired of scav now allowed to eat a headshot
xray362,They don't detect being aimed at but it will often not take long for then to notice you
WWDubz,The Russian hobos got hands
TP4LL2P,"Straight Skill issue, If you aim at him and are Not able to kill him you deserve that death. Learn from IT and Hit your shot."
Emotional-Country-58,"lmao just another terrible part of tarkov, the accuracy part gets really ridiculous sometimes but the worst offender is when a client aims at a scav, it sends a signal to it telling it to immediately crouch because its in the line of fire in an attempt to dodge and fire back at the player is pure cheesiness."
andyfibb,"to be honest, if you have the time to aim at them, you had time to aim at their head and shoot before they shoot, albeit a short window, its still there. it helps if you have good fps 90-100+ ive been getting better fps somehow lately  i changed nothing but the increased frames without dropping any makes it much more feasable for me, i was freezing sometimes before, was god awful vs ai especially."
Loliess,Skill issue
Low-Client-2555,Skill issue
Klunkepigen,"This is a needed feature though. It’s way too easy to pick off scavs if they don’t attack you. And you will get agroed way too annoying often by scavs else.
For instance, shoreline and scav island, you run just past it if you don’t look at it, but if you aim at a scav he will attack you"
Inevitable-Stage-490,We all have bad days
YeetMemez,Honestly-your complaint is invalid. I’ve had scavs run straight past me 10 meters out without even noticing me. I’ve tracked them for extended periods of time scoped in without them so much as flinching. Get gud.
DeSimoni,It’s got a little better recently but those scavs are still op if you don’t get the first shot. Swear they be seeing me in places they shouldn’t and don’t in places they should too
BlindMonktoStronk,"I went as a chad for the first timr (first wipe and i just crafted my first .45 ap bullets. I was chasing someone, killed him and a scav fucking shoots me in my eyes before i could evem react and it got me so mad"
beau261,"Loaded into woods, spawned, went prone, came back from making coffee. Dead.  
Some garden scav seek and destroyed my stationary pmc. Haha"
Carlsgonefishing,I don't think a single person disagrees with  you.
Dependent-Mission714,So what do yall want? Lame brain ai that arent dangerous? With primitive tarkov nature they are already easy enough i like the thrill of a potential head eyes from an npc lol
