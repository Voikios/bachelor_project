shogi_x,">Lawmakers have yet to be able to come up with a plan that garners enough support from both sides of the aisle to get a bill through Congress. Democrats in 2022 scrapped a plan to vote on such legislation before the midterm elections, even after Pelosi reversed course and expressed openness to colleagues voting for stock trading reform.

>Along with Hawley‚Äôs bill, a bipartisan duo in the House has introduced a bill this year on the topic. Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) and Chip Roy (R-Texas) introduced the Trust in Congress Act this month, marking the third time the pair have introduced the legislation.

So it's not really new legislation and it's probably not going anywhere. Hawley is just taking shots at Pelosi for attention."
ExoticMeatDealer,Congresspeople need to stop trading stocks; no question. I‚Äôm still not signing up for shit Hawley wants without reading the fine print. Dude is a snake.
Ok-Efficiency-3694,"Casinos taking bets how long Hawley will run with this good idea, and then how far he will run away from this good idea once the first sign of trouble surfaces."
Metallic144,"This would be fine with me, except Hawley opposed a very similar bipartisan bill when it came up in the previous Congress.

This is just an attention grab that he knows won‚Äôt pass (and I‚Äôm somewhat doubtful he even wants it to)

[S.3494 - Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3494)"

nizo505,"Now someone introduce the Hawley Act that bans insurrectionists from holding office.

Edit: words are hard"
accountabilitycounts,I say Democrats put up no fuss on this one and let Republicans torpedo it themselves.
allpoliticsislocal,Almost identical to the bipartisan Trust in Government Act except he drops dependent children from the scope.  Why?
Zanos-Ixshlae,"How about the Hawley act, where you can't register your sister's address as your primary address to run for office in a state you don't live in?"
monkeyhind,"The Pelosi Act?  These people are so childish.  

Yesterday they kicked three Democrats off of committees as payback for the Republicans who had previously been kicked off of committees.  The Republicans had been kicked off committees for legitimate reasons.  The reverse was merely retaliatory and performative."
TavisNamara,"Did you know the top ***five*** winners in the stock market in Congress in 2021 were ***all Republicans***?

Pelosi was the best performing Democrat, yes, but Dan Crenshaw, John Curtis, French Hill, Brian Mast, and Austin Scott, all Republican representatives, outperformed her, Scott by a genuinely absurd margin.

Where's the Scott act to ban stock trades, Hawley? Where is it?

Shavethatmonkey,"Republicans are as corrupt as corrupt can be, they'll never vote for that."
nova_rock,"How about preventing all speculative financial instruments, and putting their holdings into a blind trust?

like the TRUST in Congress Act, as opposed to a grandstanding name?"
AdrieBow,"Hmmm.

Not that I disagree, but I am sure he owns stock and mutual funds so‚Ä¶ he could show good faith by ditching his. 

But, lbh, this is a jab at Nancy which is designed to fail and is nothing more than political theater."
rummyreader, This dipshit? The running man? üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
DPSOnly,Eye fucking roll at the name. He knows this is not going to pass because his party is the most guilty of this but he just wants a headline with the GQP's boogieman.
Business_Error6992,Dems should vote yes for it.  Just so his dumbass has to vote against it when the GOP is forced to block it.
TripleSingleHOF,">Hawley on Tuesday introduced the Pelosi Act ‚Äî or the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act ‚Äî renewing a legislative push to curtail stock trading by lawmakers that has failed over the last few years.

I actually like the sentiment behind it, but the name on the bill is absurd. But I guess that's politics in 2023.

How long until the rest of the GOP is like ""Actually Josh, we like being able to make insider trades""?"
sid-darth,Fuck Hawley but I'm all for this legislation. Make it airtight and prevent lawmakers from profiting on any financial information.
StrongGeniusHeir,It feels weird agreeing with someone who‚Äôs an insurrectionist. Fuck him either way.
spikus93,"They aren't serious about this. They just want to make fun of Pelosi. If it comes to a vote ever, it won't pass. They'll poison pill it with like an abortion ban to make the Dems vote no, but it will never get out of committee most likely. This is all just PR."
phreeeman,"Yes, ban it.  100 percent.

But still, this is so typical GOP -- they gut the ethics committee that could enforce such a rule, then make up a scandal about Pelosi (I've seen no evidence of that Pelosi used insider knowledge and the time frame for her trade is far less damning than that for GOPers Burr and Loeffler's trades in 2020 which went unpunished), and now they propose a law that they've quietly killed in the past.  

It's almost as cynical as their supposed opposition to illegal immigration."
iRadinVerse,"On one hand this is posturing to the nth degree, on the other I absolutely agree that this should be banned. My main problem is Josh Hawley is a fucking fascist little shit who I don't trust."
robodrew,Immediately suspect of this bill because of the name and who is introducing it.  100% sure that Hawley is doing this purely to score political points with his rube constituency knowing that it will fail.
BuildyOne,"Hopefully someone introduces the ""Hawley Act"" next that prevents encouraging, supporting, and/or sympathizing with insurrectionists."
SlipySlapy-Samsonite,What about their spouses? Also fuck Hawley.
toddspremiumbacon,As much as I hate this piece of shit‚Ä¶it appears he did well for once.
livefastdie22,Lawmakers should not be trading stocks and traitors should not be making laws. Fuck Josh Hawley.
NarfledGarthak,"No chance of passing and named after a political opponent.

I wonder what this could be."
InevitableAvalanche,"Oh barf.  As if he and all his Republican colleagues don't do it too.

Pelosi is going to be like Clinton.  Out of office and Republicans still screeching about her.  Just pathetic.

This will never pass...it is just a stunt.  All Republicans are capable of are stunts or tax breaks to the super wealthy with a bunch of scandals in between."
iheartbbq,"Good. Do it, vote it in. I don't care if Hawley is doing this purely to score dumbass political points with voters he already has, this should be law."
Disastrous-Golf7216,It will never go anywhere. Too many on both sides are actively trading. This is nothing more than a talking point to distract from other things.
slabby,"When the sole purpose of legislation is to say, ""BOOM! Roasted!"""
Jerk182,Don't be fooled by Josh Hawley. Don't trust him at all. He's an insurrectionist.
tacs97,All for show. This loser has to make himself relevant again. We all know these inside traders in congress won‚Äôt ever vote against their self enrichment. What other reason is there to be a politician in todays world?
abstractedartichoke,Is this proposed law going to apply to GOP as well as democrats?
Mr-B-Hizzle,"It‚Äôs funny he‚Äôd choose to name it after her, considering how many of them do the same shit. But I guess it‚Äôs only bad when Democrats do it."
Goblin_Fucker69,Just because he's doing it out of spite doesn't mean it's not a good idea
Possible_Wasabi,"I don‚Äôt care what they call it. They could call it The Democrats Suck Dick Act and I‚Äôd still support it. They‚Äôre doing that thing where they introduce actual legislation but call it something stupid to get people in an uproar about the naming convention. People don‚Äôt care. Politicians shouldn‚Äôt be trading specific stocks, they should only be entitled to trade broad index funds."
OtmShanks55,Jogs Hallway
3d1thF1nch,"As long as that actually happens, I‚Äôm cool with that.

This is definitely a gotcha though, Republicans owning the libs. Because if the Democrats actually said ‚ÄúYea, sure, let‚Äôs do that‚Äù Republicans would shit their pants from what they thought was a stunt becoming law."
August_West1289,If this were to ever pass and go into law then the nation can forever be reminded how bold and honorable it was for Pelosi to spearhead such important legislation championing integrity in congress
LillyPip,"The Democrats already introduced a bill to stop this a couple of years ago. If the republicans actually cared about this issue instead of just demonising a prominent democrat (who has already retired, by the way), why didn‚Äôt they rally around that bill?  

Oh, because they‚Äôre not serious at all and only want to play identity politics."
user72230,"Make their portfolios and all campaign contributions public knowledge!

Edit: and lobbying"
allankcrain,"If Pelosi were smart, she'd could really fuck over Hawley here.

Like, make the bill her own. Champion it. Fight for it. It's an incredibly popular idea throughout the country, and now a Republican has introduced it and was nice enough to put her name on it.

Come out and say ""I know Senator Hawley and I rarely agree on things, but this is actually a good bill and I'm proud to have my name on it.""

Whip the Democrats into supporting it. The baseline Democrat is going to be more ethical about this stuff than the baseline Republican, so you can probably get the vast majority of the caucus on board.

And then Hawley's screwed, because his Republican colleagues DEFINITELY don't want this bill he introduced to pass, and they DEFINITELY don't want it to look like it was Nancy Pelosi's idea in the press.

She and her husband will make a little less money, but they're already millionaires, and they text of the bill makes it clear they can still invest in things like mutual funds so they'll still have investment income in addition to their very generous salaries. 

She could make the country a little bit better AND fuck over the Republicans AND especially fuck over Josh Hawley, all at the same time."
wonderingeye1,"Naming it after her is petty political theater, but a bill like this is spot-on necessary and fair"
fozzieferocious,"Republicans are a bunch of petulant fucking children. 

100% about getting Pelosi on the name of a bill. 

0% about getting any meaningful regulation of stock trading for Congress."
mnorthwood13,The single policy that I seem to agree with this shitbag on.
Faustt_Thee_Artist,Worst person you know has a good idea.
BrightSkies42,"What's the catch/loophole, or does it flat out say ""applies only to libs?"""
wrested_development,"I don't care who is introducing this legislation, it is long overdue and I hope it passes"
Sharukurusu,"Step 1. Take a good idea and frame it with partisan language.

Step 2. It fails to get bipartisan support and dies.

Step 3. ????

Step 4. Profit!

Pro tip: step 3 is insider trading"
JimPranksDwight,"Assuming there are no 'poison pills' written into this bill, I hope it passes."

SaltChildhood7,"GOP are the lamest trolls, but the theme of this bill is right on."

dirtyfacedkid,"On its surface, I got no issues with this."
arthuriurilli,"Worth it. Stopped clocks and all that.

Let the jerk get his posturing win, and let the rest of the country benefit from an unarguably good thing with a name with some shade to it."
TemporaryConfusius,"Political theatrics. There are just as many Republicans that do it. Either way, no matter the name of the bill, if it's legit than I'm all for it.

Disclaimer: Josh Hawley supported the pathetic insurrection when Republican's daddy-god-emporer lost and provenly so. Republican leaders are still the worse and often anti democratic, valueless, hypocritical, souless peices of shit. Republicans... Not even once, people..."
v9Pv,Look at the details on this from a known liar republican. Plus there‚Äôs no way the GQP wants the insider trading scam halted.
totallyaburner,"Hawley is a cowardly two-faced conniving spineless rat shit little cuck, but this is a bill I could get on board with. Congress shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to get stupid wealthy on insider trading, and Pelosi kind of brought the name of the bill on herself considering her response to suggestions barring congress from doing so."
tonyinvegas,Can we also have a ‚ÄúHawley Act‚Äù that prevents Senators from running away from insurrectionists that they supported?
Kantsas,So that POS is actually doing something right?  I don't get it and I'm immediately suspicious.  Reading the fine print will be a must.  If it's a  real thing anyway.
No-Document-8970,"I agree with this. Also need to add that people overseeing committees, companies, and enact regulations should not trade as well."
fromabuick,I agree with Hawley and on this and think they should get their healthcare thru Obama care‚Ä¶ good enough for us good enough for you shit bags
shamansufi,"Say what you will, but the expansion of the acronym, ""Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Stocks and Investment Act"" is pretty funny!"
ThemDawgsIsHell2,Spare me. They aren‚Äôt going to do this to themselves. Both side of the aisle profits from insider knowledge.
AloeEmporium,"How about someone introduced the Josh Hawley Act, banning members of Congress from seditious conspiracy?"
Designer_Insect_9184,"Still no law banning congressman from supporting an attack on the Capitol though, huh?"
GavinZero,"This is all for show, he knows damn well it has a snowball‚Äôs chance in hell of passing. He won‚Äôt even get a 4th of his own party to vote for it.

But he‚Äôll be able to say he was the one ‚Äústriving for ethics‚Äù"
Toimaker,Dems should call it an honor for Pelosi to be named in this important bill and they should all vote for it. Then watch the GOP vote it down.
Schiffy94,">or the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act 

As usual, think of the acronym before deciding what is actually stands for.

And this is a problem that's existed long before Pelosi became a major figure in Congress, and in both parties. Using the name to target her is childish and exactly what I'd expect out of a guy like Hawley."
cheese8904,Congress people and direct family members.
kirbyfox312,Dems should have Pelosi support it publicly and even offer to sign on as a co sponsor of the bill. Thank Hawley for wanting to work with them on this issue and even naming it for her for all the hard work she has done.
Protonbox22,"So republican seditionists who legally cannot hold office continue to hold office while the democrats lack any power to do anything at all. 

Keep tolerating this Americans! We aren't headed towards a civil war or anything just keep pretending everything is gonna be fine! I'm sure your childrens future isn't gonna be impacted by your apathy..."

JLake4,"In this thread there's a lot of ""Yeah well Republicans do better at trading stocks than Democrats do so aha, we win!"" in the top few comments. 

I think the fact you're comparing how corrupt the two parties' politicians are in an effort to say the other party is *more* corrupt is a carnival sideshow. How nuts is it that we're just taking the corruption as a fact of life and just trying to say ""Well *that* side does corruption worse!"" 

We should want all of these criminals out of office! *Any* corruption should be disqualifying regardless of party affiliation!"
Classic_Dill,"I'm going to bite my tongue off, after i say this but....its a good law."
Hobo_Code,"There needs to be some other non-Congressional governing body that dictates specifically what Congress can and cannot do.  

It's difficult to imagine Congress taking away a method of enriching itself or undoing corruption that they are benefiting from.  When there's a choice between money or integrity (especially when there are no consequences) money will win most of the time."
benokilgor,The big question is what extra shit is in the bill? This seems like a cover for something they are trying to push thru under the radar.
Apprehensive_List365,"The Conservative Republican Florida Supreme Court upholds a new state law banning sensible gun laws, therefore allowing the mass murders and shootings with military assault rifles to continue to slaughter innocent school children and other Americans in public places.
If one media outlet had the courage to publish a photo of the slaughter of our children and other innocent Americans killed by these military assault rifles it would cause a public outcry to ban them now!
TALLAHASSEE (AP)
Florida lawmakers can fine local government officials who attempt to restrict gun and ammunition sales under a state law upheld by the state Supreme Court on Thursday.
And they call themselves Christians!"
42_the_only_answer,"Given the choice, I would vote for Pelosi over Hawley. I would go so far as to say I have not yet agreed with a position that Hawley has taken‚Ä¶until now. I don‚Äôt see a problem with this. (Serious) I‚Äôm open to someone telling me why this is a bad idea."

RealShotline,"I don't care who introduces it, what they call it, or who passes it.  It needs to be done.  Members of Congress, who have access to information that the general public does not, should not be trading stocks or other securities. Period, full stop!  

And Hawley is a piece of shit!"
xeonicus,"A bill that does the same thing was introduced to Senate last year by Elizabeth Warren and co-sponsored by a number of Democrats.  [S.3631](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3631)

BurghPuppies,Guess who just put a target on his own back.
KC_experience,"To be effective it would require all spouses and other family members to also be barred from trading.  You know, like the son of Chris Collins.  I‚Äôm fine with it on the whole.  It‚Äôs a fucking joke they named it after Pelosi as her husband has been a VC person for decades and making money.  Also, all she has to do is be investigated, charged and convicted if Hawley thinks she‚Äôs guilty.  But a few Republicans *have* been found guilty. Yet, they go after someone that hasn‚Äôt been charged.  Class act, those republicans that ignore their own party‚Äôs shenanigans‚Ä¶"

Dogzirra,"Hawley introduces an anti-corruption measure and generously names it after Pelosi.  I'm sure that his fellow Republican representatives will support such a bill.

Is that /S or not?"
theartofanarchy,As long as elected officials can profit from insider knowledge the real losers will be the general public. The net worth of these people before they are elected and one year later is ridiculous.

graveRobbins,See that. Even a treasonous piece of shit has a few good ideas every now andvthen.
FredFredrickson,"I mean, lawmakers shouldn't be trading stocks, but also... how is this insurrectionist fist pump/scared running clown still in office?"
FireDawg10677,Good
hymie0,"That's odd. Two years ago, it was perfectly fine when elected leaders made money from the hotels they own."
smeeding,I want the Hawley Act that bans insurrectionists from holding public office
Mcdibbles,Didn't AOC already sponsor a bill like this?
blatantninja,"He's not wrong,he's just an asshole"
RustyChicken16,"Yeah actually I‚Äôm behind the concept. With zero reading of the article, of course"
Smarterfootball47,"Trading stocks bad.
Being paid by interest groups to vote a certain way, good."
PhyterNL,"Is this some kind of weird joke? Dems tried to pass a bill banning lawmakers from trading stocks and Republicans like Hawley... wait let me check my notes... voted no.

https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3494"
dual_gear,"Democrats tried to do this a few weeks ago and all the Republicans voted against it.  This is for show, obviously due to the name of the bill.  He didn't have the balls to do this when she was Speaker.  There's a poison pill in it so the Democrats will vote against it and this shit stain will claim they don't want to do anything about it."
saijanai,"Well, it is a needed bit of legislation, but if he were serious about getting it passed, he wouldn't have named it the way he did."
aresef,"Why single her out? Why not call it the Perdue Act or the Hoeven Act or the Burr Act?

And why haven't this traitorous fuck and his buddies been run out of Washington yet?"
PearlDivers,How about introducing the Hawley Act to ban insurrectionists from being lawmakers?
Sillygooseman23,You dummies commenting: ‚Äúwell this is exactly the kind of thing I want banned but I (R)eally don‚Äôt like Josh Hawley! I guess I hate it!‚Äù
The_Bogan_Blacksmith,Wont pass... too many old rich assholes participating in insider trading
LittleWillyWonkers,"Republican politics stink, always having to use keywords to attack. We all know a lot of congress people are doing this on both sides and Pelosi was actually open to at least discussing it. It isn't in any way like she's the only one taking advantage of this, she was open to discuss. But it sounds great on Fox calling it this and twisting shit, so much for un-mainstream media.

But yes it would be great to make it illegal, but it's BS this way and we also know it will never pass."
32BitWhore,"Acting like congresspeople would ever vote for something that stops them from getting richer that is more than a piece of toothless garbage anyway. Even if legislation like this passes, it will almost certainly carve out enough exemptions that it won't make a bit of practical difference."
PurpleSignificant725,I hate that I support anything he does.
CougdIt,"Is this how we can actually get Republican support for things? Have democrats do things they actually want banned and speak against things they want to pass?

Republicans own the libs by voting for the things the democrats actually want."
hibernating-hobo,"No matter what side of the political spectrum you are on, this is a good idea."
neutral-chaotic,This would face a bipartisan lack of votes.
zeno0771,"Wait, WHO introduced this bill?"
RedditRuleViolator,"https://www.capitoltrades.com/trades

Or just make money off of it."
thesecolorsdorun,Love the idea in theory but Hawley is not trustworthy and the name of the bill is about as classless as one can get.
redwing180,If you did this though then why would Congress members spend literally millions of dollars become Congress members? To enact legislation which represents the people of their state as if they were some sort of representative?! oh please you all are missing the point of being a congress member! Everybody knows the point of being a congress member is for self enrichment and financial gain by enacting legislation which personally benefits you and accepting donations which you can euphemistically call campaign contributions. That‚Äôs why so many Congress members start off with thousands of dollars and end up being a multimillionaire just after a few terms.
Tonald-Drump-666,"Oh this asshole I'm so glad the footage of him running from ""peaceful protesters"" forever be preserved on video. He's a traitor and I'm sure he made plenty of money like many of them did when they knew what was coming and they were dumping stocks and buying into companies that made cleaning products and protective gear."
victechy,There is always a loophole.
dimforest,Hate him. I love the concept of the bill though.
anotherone121,Cool. Now do corporate campaign donations and gerrymandering too.
puck33420,Ummmm - does he realize that these types of bills generally carry the name of the victims or proponents of reform (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legislation_named_for_a_person)?? I hope it passes - long after people forgot who sponsored it they will attach pelosi‚Äôs name to good policy. What a lump.
jtscira,"Fucking hate that prick and he should be in jail.

But he's right on this one."
felixbotticelli,"It's a good idea in principle but stupidly named, and makes it hard to pass. Which makes me wonder if he even wants it to pass."
blind_squirrel62,So when AOC and Elizabeth Warren proposed this they were communists infringing on personal liberties.
spacegiantsrock,This traitor needs to be in prison.
Dramatic_Sugar2317,It‚Äôs funny cuz he thinks he‚Äôs doing something with the name but he‚Äôs hurting himself
anonbene2,No Republicans will vote for this
mark5hs,Honestly to do this right it really needs to be a constitutional amendment. Any legislation is going be full of loopholes or will be sneakily weakened through a trillion dollar omnibus bill down the road.
