fuckboy_city,Fingers crossed the audio gets noticeably better with these changes
elrabbit0,"Boy, I can't wait for `Several other changes and fixes`

But for real, it's nice to see some preemptive communication! I hope to see this trend continue."
Joeys2323,"Damn some actual communication, this is nice. looking forward to the DLSS update and sound fixes"
afg2203,"New group system. Now one member of the party spawns in another map. Enjoy. 😁

Edit: Not joking. F me.... Played 3 Shoreline raids yesterday with two friends. Every raid we spawned as solo in opposite ends of the map and opposite extracts!"
Cringingthrowaway1,"Hoping but not holding my breath for fixing audio issues. They have ""fixed"" audio like 6 or 7 times over the last 2 years and only ONCE did it not make things worse."
Mobile_Risto31,"I just wish the preformance issues me and my friends (at least) are having could be fixed, the game stutters a lot and generally really low fps too"
hiidkwatdo,Whoa is this communication about a patch BEFORE a patch? Nice work fella
MisedraN,"Any performance fixes for lighthouse and streets ??
Please i beg u bsg
I want to play these maps but the fps drops,stutters and rubber banding is unbearable"
AlcoholicSkeleton,The biggest crime was the looking for group button.
ilovetechno71,"They forgot to add

\- New Streamer Item. RENAGWRLOL crying baby doll"
Mesromith,Happy that they are actually communicating something tbf
AnonNorwegian,ETA: 2-4 years.
Tropod8,"Wonder if they’ll update to DLSS 2.5.1, which I believe came with Portal RTX or The Witcher 3.

It should remove ghosting considerably, which is the only reason i cant use it with EFT, scoping in is painful on a painkiller."
Rdugs,"I got excited, it's just a roadmap though."
sucr4m,some actual good dlss implementation would be a dream.
Z0EBZ,"Can we fix the lighting on other maps...? Streets ain't that bad aside from all the damn rubber banding. Hopefully (doubtfully) the audio will be fixed, at least stuff like sounds missing all the time. Sounding like a pessimist when I read ""several other changes and fixes"" as either ""more bs to ""slow down progression"" or ""that's enough work for one month"""
dylangutt,Why no mention of streets rubberbanding or memory leaks? That should be a top priority
ranopan0,very good they communicate
marniconuke,"Well i fo rone i'm glad they are at least communicating, looking forward to those fixes"
l3uLLDoZeR,Maybe I won’t hear random gunshots next to my head now.
CanadianBear67,Fuck me they got to do these posts alot earlier man. Communication is key especially if we are beta testing the game.
-Shaskis-,"Some actual communication, but I want to see actions not words, preferably their game to run better."
No_Issue214,We are at the point where im scared everytime they are going to fix audio
Ivandragosgopnikson,"Planned™

Confirmed™

Trust the Process™"
geoguy2001,"I feel like I've seen these lists before.  A patch comes out, shit breaks, and they put out a patch fixing the biggest issue, maybe one or two more.  The rest of the problems stick around.  I remember when the glasses bug became a thing, I thought it would be fixed pretty quickly, it seemed like a simple issue.  It's still a thing."
ThoroughSix7,What about fixing some people constantly disconnecting and we have to either play with a VPN or litterally call our ISP to change out fucking router settings to play a game in...what year it is it again *checks watch* 2023
HavelDad,"They hear us at least, hopefully the audio fixes come sooner than later. Love this game, and I can deal with the BS it puts me through, I was even fine with just the bushes fist fucking my ears and vertical audio being nonexistent, but now Audio is just, bad, sounds turn on and off, lil half miliseconds of audio clips still randomly playing sometimes, hearing people right out the window of my building doing a firefight but when I look it turns out they're underground. Bleh at this point I aught to just start playing with music on"
SourceNo2702,"Jesus christ, why did it take so long for them to tweet this. A simple “we are working on it” would have set most people at ease."
Haarwichs,"Oh nonono they don't even mention the rubberbanding and low fps on streets. This doesn't bode well, boys.
Also not mentioned: D2 extract being bugged as well as aidrops not working correctly. 

Also what about missing sounds for bushes, barbed wires, planes etc.?"
,"New Player Group System - why NOW?

Btw: Been there, seen that -> https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1490700996883980297

Promises everywhere and declarations of „XYZ is fine 👌“ since years now.


Hard to believe anymore, despite all the bütfuckery that is going on since a while (War etc). Time will tell…"
WhatRobulus,"This might sound a bit conspiratorial, and it might be a translation error, but the part about sound reads like they only are fixing binaural audio. Which almost everyone has turned off because it halves your frames."
roflwafflelawl,"So do they just not have internal testing? I know new issues can always pop up once a build goes live but specifically the audio I feel should have had more testing before getting pushed out. 

It's just way too off for it to have released in the state it was in and I don't honestly have high hopes with the planned fixes considering the improvements we were supposed to (at least I think so) get with Steam audio which they scrapped after 2 years of using it."
bluegunmetal9,This looks pretty good. Hope DLSS is improved and worth using !
the-apostle,Knowing BSG this will be 2-3 business years before these changes are implemented
Silver_Roll_4727,Everything but anti cheat sadge
DawSkii,I am waiting for streets to stop fucking bluescreening my pc
stanger828,Hears footsteps everywhere and nowhere all at once like a horror game.
HaZarD_SFD,I feel if they just concentrated on the Sound and Map Optimization for a month it would greatly increase the quality of the game.  I just would like to not panic when the phantoms run through me (On the second floor or basement).
Songoku185,Fix the cheating
P0werEdge,"""PLANNED"" might be a day might be a month might be a year."
RichHedge,arena coming 2027
sleepy_the_fish,"Guarantee they're going to move 9 mm AP to peacekeeper 4 for the ""other changes"" section"
Alone_Manufacturer66,"Guys it’s a beta, you should expect these problems…..jeez it’s only been 6 years. Cut ole Nikita some slack."
Rolo-CoC,Bare fucking minimum communication.
Diovanna,"All of the issues with Streets is surely caused by geometry and lighting, right? COPIUM"
eye_gargle,"\-No mention on server lag/desync fix

\-No mention on performance optimization for Streets of Tarkov

\-DLSS update on what, 3.0? The only version 0.01% of the population that owns a 40-series GPU can use?

\-No mention on fixes to scavs/raiders/rogues/bosses instantly headshotting or grenading you before you even see them

To the people that are applauding them for communicating, do you have to be reminded that this is supposed to be expected by a gaming studio, in 2023?"
TimmeTehWise,"Servers... Where are the servers, we really need some work done for the dsync, as it is apparently resulting in some people receiving unlucky bans.

 Aside from that though this is good, at least as long as I've been playing I've never seen them release anything resembling a short term roadmap like this."
Turtvaiz,"Seems kinda small for a planned list. It's probably mostly audio things because it was clearly a WIP, and then bug fixes. DLSS update might just mean updating the library too.

But at least they're communicating something."
Stunning-Cap7396,I LOVE YOU BSG
Poonamoon,"Thanks to BSG and good on them for the communication 

Also glad they are listening to the community and prioritizing fixing the audio issues"
TheBigZamboni85,"BSG, I do a LOT of complaining on this sub and all I have to say is THANK YOU. Thank you for some level of communication and acknowledging the issues with the current state of the game. 

Communicating with us plans, progress, and even roadblocks/hiccups that cause delays goes a long way in tampering frustrations. So again, thank you"
Swag_MGee,Soon™
Alpenvibes,"yeah, no.

honestly, all i wanted to hear was something about cheaters and fucked servers desync"
PatumGently,And silence on the cheating continues
IIIKitsuneIII,"Lol as if that's enough to fix the absolute fuckup of the state of game they've made this wipe. 
After getting used to using my speakers for audio since directional and distance sound cues are virtually non-existent, the real issue is the desync. Holy shit. Aslan may as well have waltzed on over from Narnia, shoved an ak in my ass and ranted for half an hour in between me walking behind a wall and the other players or scavs seeing that... I have almost a ^1GB/700mb/14ms to OCE hosts, yet get less desync on Singa. Everything else is tolerable. After playing since 2016, I've  put it down for about 3wks now, no interest to pick it up again anytime soon."
Sea_Information_4012,"i think they should start fixing the memory problem, set the server to reset from time to time because it's clear when they have to shutdown and bring servers back they are actually good for a few days... and move to sound.

after every update that requires servers to be shutdown and they are back online they feel better in every aspect, sound, desync..."
TurtleBilliam,Performance issues?
0utF0x-inT0x,How bout some performance issues everything else is secondary imo
mrpicachu,"Finally audio tweaks, now I can hear where everyone spawns and hear them as they get further away but hear them less as they get closer."
AdhesiveCam,It's too bad the devs are all literally deaf so there's no telling whether they'll fix it or make it worse as they obviously just guess and tick boxes and hope for the best
Tylerswolf69,yeah fixing these will just break other things in the game. lol
frymustdie,Doesn't sound very impressive
little_hoarse,Now if they let me control my own recoil WHOOO BOI
CarbonRunner,Well at the rate bsg has done things over last couple years. This list of fixes will get dealt with sometime in the next couple years... by which point twice as many new bugs will be introduced
Raikohhh,"I bet they can fuck the audio even more, BSG are very talented at that"
keeeven,"Too little too late, but appreciated none the less"
llB1ackoutll,Mmm yes fix one thing break another /s
Continuedgripe,"And nerfing scavs right… right ….?

Seriously SKS scavs are more intimidating than PMCs."
Domified,New player group system!? This better not mean skill based or level based matchmaking...
Sesleri,">an estimated plan

Ok so maybe 2 years from now"
katanahibana,Fix this dogshit fucking audio. Resort is a nightmare. Fix the blatant aimbot cheaters. I'm honestly fed up at this point
meand1army,Hoping for mentor to be fixed
smittyK,How often do they release “updates” throughout a wipe?
AccountantOk7335,"Im getting worried that im seeing nothing about fixing scavs, fingers crossed thats in the “other fixes”"
brendo2013,"Well there goes the lighting on streets, can anyone think of an issue there?"
Ruudvangoal,How about SCAVs shooting through bushes and trees?
Yupz69,Why is no one talking about the AK-modding bug? When you mod an ak you can only change 3 things and then go back to the menu and back to stash again otherwise it will crash... its been there for god knows how long and yet no one is bringing it up.
szlose,So what about the shadow flickering issue? Its been there for months and still no fix...
Wiket123,New Group System?
MyHouz,YESSSS. I have hated barely playing this wipe and falling behind while waiting for sound fixes.
Truckengineer,Maybe with dlss I get more that 30 frames on streets and lighthouse..
Reasonable_Aside_904,Wipe the game again!
Atarru_,This is what their main goal should be for next wipe not another map.
GdanskinOnTheCeiling,"Will the fixes for UI bugs include the 1440p+ inventory scaling/scrolling issue?

Place bets now."
jubjubninja,"Dlss 3.0 would be perfect for Tarkov, I wonder if it will ever be implemented"
iWanttoKillaMan,The mp9 30 round mag’s reload audio has another mag being reloaded in the background at a lower volume. Fix that too👌👌👌
Sintik,Two big wins is audio and new player group system. I would love to see some work on load balancing for queue times. Hell I’ll buy a small data center to host in so cal haha
Skul_12,Hopefully the dlss fix makes it so I can use scopes again without 1x being blurry and the magnified being laggy because without dlss the game runs fine but I can’t get the extra 40fps
MoonBoy2DaMoon,Still no plans to fix X-ray vision scavs
Wedehawk,Fingers crossed i can actually play streets then. Every map runs smooth except for that one
Recent_Paramedic3970,Need an update on streets map to even play it
OCWBmusic,I'm sure they'll fix the audio just like how they have fixed flashlight beams passing through walls.
R0G3RK0K,No word on the stealth/weight/sound issue?
Stew514,"I really want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but their answer to everything is ""Yes that is planned""."
khswart,Are they planning to fix the marked room cheese where you can drop in from above on streets?
Schwertkeks,I believe it when I see it.
Wurmitz,Yea ok
Dirtydantheman95,"All I want is to be able to move stuff if my stash without having to force quit the game because of the item not able to move error. Most annoying and ridiculous glitch to still have in this game, been playing 6 years, and it’s still here."
LukeTheRevhead01,The DLSS update is something we should've had ages ago considering updating it is as simple as changing one .dll file
SuperRektT,Yea same shit for wipes then its broken and then the same tweet xd
CreativeMischief,I quit at level 6 because of the audio. Might come back if its better than pre-patch
vgamedude,New group system? Wish there was a system where everytime I fight its not vs a 3 man.
Sinikal_,I'm guessing 5% of proposed things actually pan out in a positive manner.
Rocks1t,DLSS upgrade 😗
FlyingAces3,New player group? Any idea what that's referring to?
Yungterpintine,So ready for this new party system 😮‍💨
GravelsNotAFood,"This is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, I really feel like they're just not competent enough to deliver something good on these promises. They've given me plenty of reasons not to trust them."
Admiral_Thrawn_7,Scav xray vision not even mentioned
VoidSythe,"The DLSS update will be interesting. For me right now, it makes a great difference when testing in offline mode, but absolutely nothing when in an actual online game."
josHi_iZ_qLt,"And here is me hoping desperately that the rubberbanding and lagging on every streets instance is included with ""several other fixes"". Why bother making a bulletpoint for fixing of their new content? Right? Its surely not because they arent doing anything. That cant be. Hopium supply is running low guys."
DangeringOdinson,"Fix Aug Recoil please. It is spasmic, not realistic at all."
Handsome_Gourd,Let me know when they decide to do something about recoil
x7heCH13Fx,Hopefully they address the memory leak people are reporting
XF270HU,"They'll fuck it up more than it already is, audio has been broken since forever. 7 years!"
Linerider99,"How about going back to leaving the boxes open when they’ve already been looted? Add a new menu like the door breach, have search or close"
a7i_,Where Cheaters
JJdisco21,See all the complaining was just pointless…
Matchlesslime89,Is new player groups system a system for new players or a new 'player group system'
Mysterious-Ad7791,How about a better anticheat?
Volomon,Wait DLSS update....woooo.  Whats this about Oculus Audio this has VR?
Rootorii,"Great, now the poppin sound is back, which was the reason they move from Stream audio to Oculus audio."
Pioppo-,"Oh my god? After 5 years I can *maybe* stop having to invite my brother after every single raid to play together? Hope so.

Not to mention the state of teaming up before a raid a few wipes ago took MINUTES before receiving the invite"
ZelexG,If they get rid of the ability to change pov when aimed im done playing
why_are_yu_sad,"I hope they fix the lighthouse performance soon, it’s like it regressed back to the point when it first came out."
_XIIX_,"i wonder if binaural audio will still eat up \~20 fps when its working, it would basically just give more advantage to people with nasa pc's"
stuckInACallbackHell,Nice to see some better communication and transparency from BSG.
Pyramid9,oh no
flops031,DLSS update looking juicy
ungratefulanimal,What would a new player group system be? Put new players in a new player lobby? Make that lobby easier to not head head eyes by scavs on customs?
Dr_Cannibalism,"Hope Mentor gets fixed. I don't have the euros for it yet, but I probably will within a week or two."
MindlessMinuteman,Is streets of tarkov actually going to be playable without rubber banding?
Krilesh,if im not using headphones does it matter if i dont use binaural audios assuming it worked properly? i don’t understand who binaural audio is for
QuestioningSunflower,BSGs priorities continue to amaze.
Special_Function,"The reason everything sounds crappy is because they are using Oculus audio. As an Avid Oculus Rift user I can tell you, that sound engine isn't made for FPS games. The sound will continue to be broken."
gladbmo,Sneak fix pls....
oxGrEeKxo,New player group system? I hope its like a way for new players to group up with Sherpas or something. Cause at first glace that sounds like new guys grouping together. Which would be an easy way to farm pmc kills i guess
skrubzei,"Weird, I don’t see any fix for dumping 90 rounds into another player/scav only for them to turn around and one tap you.

Maybe next time."
alolaloe,"Surely this time it includes recoil adjustments.

How I wish to be able to shoot minimal modded guns with iron sights."
divzx24,Please fix interchange audio.
Quirky_Koala,Hotfixes plural. So it will be fixed by the next wipe (maybe).
DevilJabanero,Crazy how resort still doesn't have any audio for staircases
OmaeBakaKa,Hackers everywhere. Player scavs insta hs esp on interchange
cjhoser,what about stopping people from floating around map and taking all good loot before i get to it.
Prestigious_End_2436,Hopefully dlss doesn't look like I'm wearing water filled scuba goggles
vrasey,Please fix the fucking Asia. Players from Korea and Japan + some other countries are forced to play on 200ping servers or China
Basaltmyers,Any idea if they’re gonna fix reserve?
derBlonde,"Please fix the horrible bug where ""trader won't buy"" gets stuck to your cursor when exiting a trader via esc whilst hovering over a backpack"
Deericious,Wish there was a statement about sniper quests not giving a full level. If it was intended or will be fixed.
METR0B00M1N,still no recoil changes zzzz
Wizard_IT,"No plan to work on stopping the hackers, aimbotting, and esp that are ruining that game?"
RecordAway,Plot twist: this is the actual development roadmap just copy and pasted
h1pp1e_cru5her,I haven't been able to login since new year thanks to your dumbass 2 step authentication not wanting to send me an email. This game is dead to me
ReasonableConfusion,"I mean, I hope it’s true but at this point I don’t have too much faith.  If this materializes then that’s cool but if not, well, I guess I’ll play until the game is no longer fun at all.  I enjoyed it most around 0.12 and some changes since then have been good but even more have been bad. The game is still more fun than not but much less so than it was back in late 2019/early 2020."
Huli_CH,Just played 3 Rounds Customs Auto EU and got killed by 3 Cheater each time doing the prone stand prone stand moving around and when i try to engage magnet headshot me with t ammo. I guess the banwave last week didnt do fuckall...
Dr_Bojangles_,"Cool, cool. Fix the fucking cheating problem."
SparklingSloth,I just want to be able to play without the game freezing every time I shoot. Tried the fresh driver solution and have tried every combo of setting there is. Have only had the issue with this wipe
ApeOfDiamondz,"In all seriousness, thank you BSG. All we want is some communication."
PrinceOfRye,I can’t wait for them to fuck up finding a match with this “new player group system” if there’s one thing I’ve learned through the wipes it’s that any new system from this company is usually broken on release.
medkitjohnson,"Lighting for streets? THROW INTERCHANGE A BONE! Please I beg of you, just one time!"
M-Gnarles,Whats the worst that could happen...
Emergency_Shift_2814,Fix micro stuttering please
cjhoser,No Streets rubber band fix???????
Ikuorai,"Audio and footsteps are my biggest two, with memory leaks being a close third.  Hope they fix allllllllll the audio."
gen_adams,"if this is not a 57 page long document, then I am selling my EFT account to the highest bidder."
Nicz1606,"For me: Clearly better Performance and opimization \^\^  
The other Ideas etc are also important/nice but some people can barely play that game or use scopes like a 4x."
Kmieciu4ever,"Streets of Tarkov expansion! 

Cuts FPS in half ;-)"
Maderas_,"might have been better if the ""hotfixes"" had come sooner than 3 weeks out after half the playerbase already tapped, maybe stop releasing huge updates right before major holidays idk I'm not a game developer"
