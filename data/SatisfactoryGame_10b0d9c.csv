Temporal_Illusion,"**MORE INFO**

1. View [Game Play - Mass Crafting](https://youtu.be/Z6bo0pjYghk?t=5520) *(Video Bookmark - Experimental Branch Update 6 Release Stream - June 14, 2022)* \- Snutt stressed the information where you only have to hit Space key once to start and once to stop to Mass Craft items. **You don't need to hold down Space Bar!!**
2. The Pioneer can tap **\[Space\] Key ONCE** instead of holding down **Left Mouse Button** on the Craft button or even holding down **\[Space\] Key**. Just tap [Space] Key again to STOP Mass Crafting.
3. This has been in the Game since Update 4.

CautiousFreedom6889,Why do that when you can just double tap space and it does the same thing
Doranagon,Um... tap it. once. just once. (this will be the 666th time you've heard this today)
TerfyHorizon585,"You actually just have to press space once, and it will autocraft"
AeSix_Reficul,"Pro tip: tap the space bar to initiate automatic manual crafting.  
Pro tip #2: hit tab while you're manually mining ores, and it will continue to mine while you're in the inventory screen.  You can watch your inventory fill up that way.  
Pro tip #3: press r to enter zoop mode. Press r again for some items to enter vertical mode.  
Pro tip #4: hold ctrl while rotating foundations, get 1/72 of a full rotation at a time.  
Pro tip #5: hold shift when placing a foundation in an area way from other foundations for it to snap to the world grid.  This is great for aligning things up (like roadways you're building from both ends)"

Tap the space bar once.

Boom! All problems solved."
themarknessmonster,"So, knowing all these other Pioneers have already told you, I'll tell you it took me two weeks before I figured that out.  Of course I didn't look it up, I just happened to have tapped space once and noticed that it started crafting.  I stopped, tried it again, and once more to be sure...by the time I figured it out I had already clocked close to 100-some-odd hours."
Panic_00,"Pathetic mortal.. Automate a super computers, so you can ascend to godhood."
FizzyEels,"You know you can just tap the spaceb‚Ä¶ just kidding.

Q: How many Satisfactory Pioneers does it take to change a light bulb?

A: 0 pioneers to perform the lightbulb change as everything has to be automated and efficient as possible, and 50 pioneers to explain the exact same process of how to automate the lightbulb change if it‚Äôs a comment to a single Reddit post where the user has been changing the lightbulb manually all this time."

LeagueofBurn,just do Alt + Space
