maretex,How the fuck did NVIDIA promote this shit seriously
Windyandbreezy,Is this that game with the butt?
Rawwh,Has to be one of the more elaborate scams in videogame history.
sophisticaden_,It‚Äôs just a scam.
Turbolasertron,At this point they blatantly copy things from other games to use in their marketing to get people hyped which will bite them in the ass if the game ever releases they‚Äôve copied COD TLOU and The Division and act like no one will notice
Zhukov-74,That‚Äôs why the cover art of this game looked so familiar.
STRADD838,It's literally one of those scam phone games but AAA edition.
Survies1,Theranos style game development.
missinglinksman,"When i saw the trailer the first thing I said was ""is that The Division gameplay?"""
JacksonianEra,"What was that game that was supposed to basically be ‚ÄúGTA on steroids‚Äù? They acted like you could be anything you wanted, from police officer to firefighter, all the way to store clerk or garbage collector. Turns out it was a massive crowdfunding scam. This game reminds me of that and it‚Äôs driving me nuts."
Bloodwalker09,"I don‚Äôt get what developers are trying to achieve with that? Same with Abandoned? 

You cannot buy or preorder and there is no crowdfunding. So no money from potential buyers. 

What‚Äôs the point of this scam?"
holywars94,Anyone can give context?
WILDtaco4321,This game is a fat scam
InfernoDragonKing,"It‚Äôs a shame, really, because I‚Äôve always wanted a open-world/sandbox zombie kinda like this, plus if done right, could be a very fun game, but Dead Rising and all the other zombie-based games might fulfill that itch once again, since this is clearly reaching fraudulent territory if it hasn‚Äôt already.


If anything, this *should* make AAA devs see what the people *really* want; the amount of hype and attention this has garnered, if done properly would generate money"
Skank_hunt_042,Hey yo can I copy your homework?
keving691,They‚Äôre just a bunch of scammers. I already know people will buy the ‚Äúgame‚Äù when it releases as a meme. Stop talking about them. They don‚Äôt deserve the coverage. Put a spotlight on devs that actually make good games.
alwaysmyfault,"So either this is just a HUGE scam and there is no actual game.....

Or there is a game, but the creators have no creativity whatsoever, and just stole shit from every other popular game out there.  

I'm 50/50 tbh."
Cowi3102,Wow. Just keeps getting worse and worse for this dev lol.
Swordbreaker925,Yeah i dont trust this game
curiousgeorgie00,The whole thing is a scam.
Vicith,"Developer is a Russian company, of course they don't care about copyright."
AlphaDag13,I knew this game was too good to be true. But it will be fun to watch then crash and burn in yet ANOTHER scam.
Ripco69,Someone using a new kind of AI filter?
Kraujotaka,"The demo they showed was a mix of The last of us, the division and little of mudrunner, they surely knew that it would attract attention and it sure did for me as I love the atmosphere of The division  and the last of us.

But it seems like it will be another flop or forever delayed title, worst case it will be like that zombie game that I can't even recall the name of (competition for day z of the time)."
BlazingShadowAU,One of the areas they walk through in the latest 'gameplay' trailer is 100% somewhere from Div2. They didnt remove the generator/computer system and radio tower from the 'destroy broadcast' world objective.
edhqaz,George Santos making video games now?
typehyDro,At least they didn‚Äôt choose huge titles to copy so people wouldn‚Äôt notice so easily.
legendofthekarma,Is the studio head George Santos?
ZombieTheRogue,I DONNO WALT. YOUVE BEEN SEEMING KINDA SUS LATELY.
Surprise_Corgi,"You all really need to let this game get out of your head, and go play The Division 2 or Last of Us.  Something similar to both reasons why you're interested in this game.  It's a scam.  Even Star Citizens produced *something*, and that's one of the greatest scams in gaming."
MasteroChieftan,"This is way too much effort for it to not be something. I don't mean a game, I mean like....a study...or a research thing. I don't know. It's just so blatantly bizarre. This is like doing absolutely everything you can to compete in the Olympics except train and actually go when it's time."
nickdoesmagic,"The ass that everyone was staring at is Lara Croft. I'm like, 95% sure that's even the same fucking movement animation from the reboots, and it's absolutely the same hair/body, just with slightly different clothes"
snownative86,"It's very strange for sure. They seem to be a lazy company with no real sense of direction. Cruising their page you'll find a game company, some jargon about being a company based on volunteering and goodwill without any specific details on how or what, and then, for funsies, a company building a work productivity app similar to Teams/Slack/Zoom but it has always on voice chat. I get it, Microsoft is in games, has a strong volunteer culture and produces work apps but started with a single product then slowly branched out but to do all that as a new company? It's weird."
newretrovague,Weird? No. Fake game? You betcha
larsvondank,"My main questions are:

Why did people get so hyped? From that short cinematic clip?

How did it reach the top of Steam?

What unique or hot feature were people so hyped about?

Isnt the genre also a bit oversaturated?

To me it looked very generic and did not raise any feelings whatsoever. The gameplay clip got me doubting the whole existence of it. But anyway, scams are everywhere, this was a big one, but wth people?! why are so many so gullible?!"
enthralled_chicken,Look like some ai generated shit haha
NewAndlmproved,it's like AI generated art taking samples from everything else. seriously...can they not make one original promotional artpiece?
the_Dorkness,Must be being developed by an AI.
VADERtheSAIYAN,"Alright, look. Check who developer is. Russians often been claimed in plagiarism and stealing intellectual property. It happened a lot with music, movies industry and all other media. Most of the time they don‚Äôt care cause in some situations is impossible to charge them by certain laws while they do their business in russian federation. 
I found them living this way in many different life aspects. Logic is simple: if you can‚Äôt make your own, take it from others and adapt for your market. Sad but true"
SquishyWhite,It‚Äôs the war Z all over again
MATEeA,I have never played the last of us and genuinely thought this was a prequel when I saw a video with it.
paul-d9,You know they're scamming you when they don't release gameplay footage due to a copyright issue involving the **name** of the game.
Schkywalker,When your mate asks to copy your homework and swears he's gonna change it up so you don't get busted.
Grogosh,A mockbuster video game....huh.
pofshrimp,"Its funny. Its just going to be a Day Z clone, probably not very good. Day Z was a shit show in its own right so The Day Before might be a fairly faithful clone. Maybe even better, because come on Day Z was full of jank (I think I shot this guy 10 feet away with 9 bullets but he's still running arou... oh yeah he's down now). But it got attention with clever marketing and that propelled them above the 100 other clones you never hear of."
bigbabyjesus97,Release date April 1st?
BigMoFace,Russian game dev 101 right here.
1stRounder,"That recent extended gameplay video they put out, swear that girl character they were playing reminded me of a fortnite asset"
MrChibiterasu,This has to be infringing on copyright‚Ä¶like a lot of copyright.
smegmathor,"Fake it till you make it, but they never planned on actually making it did they?"
Hugokarenque,"Is it weird? I think its just a scam.

Honestly the weird part was that they didn't open up a kickstarter after that first trailer."
LostInMyADD,"I wish so bad it wasnt a scam, but thats exactly what what makes me know its a scam lmao"
Weird-Information-61,"Lmao I thought that scene looked an awful lot like a snowrunner knockoff, guess I was right"
PsychoDog_Music,I kinda wanna play devils advocate and say things are just too overused that ofc it happens to line up with a few things but *that is very very very similar too many times*
AtrioxLane,Bro they failed the plagiarism skill check no way
Mystic_Miser,They didn‚Äôt just steal those clips they straight up ran into the cinematic videogame trailer store with a fuckin garbage bag and started taking everything they can get their hands on
Informal-Method-5401,"Ya know. I don‚Äôt think this is going to end up being an actual game - I think this is a tech demo for an AI generated game.
I reckon the AI is scraping all the other games and piecing them together"
Uzakhaas32,Worlds first game created entirely by AI
GD_Nuzzlock,[The Division Mentioned ](https://youtu.be/sAXZbfLzJUg)
meirelle,"No, it's definitely real. George Santos confirmed it."
,[removed]
Joqjzxv,"Ellie looks over. ""Who's this guy?"""
amellt33,The game industry has been in a race to the bottom for the last 10years. No surprise new games are just copy and paste from other games. Originality is dead and the saddest part is new gamers have no idea and they just love it
Alfaale,the day before is going to be the biggest scam in gaming
ItsSpacePants,This is great üíñ
RedGhostOfTheNight,"Bet it's a study to see how much you can copy paste other popular games, with minimal effort  and see what the public would do in the end. I'm interested in just following what the result s this copy paste media yields."
IceKareemy,"This is the actual scam ppl think Star Citizen is, at least you see them slowly and time wise poorly developing it and you can play it. This is just a straight up case waiting to happen"
SirSephy,They gotta ban this developer from publishing before he (or she) scams everybody.
arkman132,There is a running theory that this game just is not real. No idea why they would take a game but something suspicious is definitely going on.
-TheBlackSwordsman-,It was a the last of us clone from the moment I saw the title cover art of the game
TehRiddles,Nothing weird about it. They just lack their own creativity and so copy other things that work beat for beat without any twist to it all.
GammaXL0,"It kinda looks like what you'd get if you let AI market a video game, just a generic amalgam of survival/ zombie/ shooters"
joezombie,A skeleton of a game with reused assets. Its a shame because a Division-type zombie game sounds awesome. Guess I'll just be waiting for Heartland to get my fix.
taxista_sorete,Can we just unlist this game from our wishlists already?
Easilycrazyhat,"While there's nothing particularly awful about cribbing other advertisements, it's generally a pretty bad sign on the quality of the product if they're not even creative enough to come up with their own marketing."
Illustrious_Joke4291,These big time games lately have been mostly CTRL + C > CTRL + V
HLef,Do you guys think it‚Äôs a some elaborate ad campaign for an HBO show?
NoahZittal,This game looks like ass.
-Clovenhorn-,No way man
dude35_,I thought it was a dlc thingy for tlou lmao üíÄ
frarrousih,I thought the game was a TLOU spinoff LUL
Flatland69,There's no way it's real. Just paying artists to make shit based on other games cinematics.
PoeReader,Well that is just straight up stolen.
pokemon_tits,100% believe this is straight up a scam
Ruby_241,"The Day Before, aka ‚ÄúThe Last Division: Cold War‚Äù"
Ohthehumanityofit,Maybe AI is developing videogames now.
-Megaflare-,It legit annoys me seeing companies do this. Imagine all the hard hours the original creators of these things put in to design and flesh out all of that art and design only for it to be ripped off by whatever loser developers are I'm charge of this project
Skreamie,"Not only that. It's biggest supporter and one of the community figureheads said within the game discord that no one has seen any evidence of gameplay yet.


Not to mention they delayed the gameplay trailer and had their title removed from Steam over a copyright issue. They said it was due to Steam maintenance but the data files showed it was removed prior to that time. They then stated they didn't know about said copyright either, so you can take that at face value and assume they're morons, or they purposely ignored the copyright issues to go on their favour.



The ""game"", if there even is one, won't even be called The Day Before anymore."
WickedSerpent,"Pff the investors deserve it. They've forced Bethesda into making fallout games they didn't enjoy like 74.
I hope this investment rugpull takes allot of money of them as ignorance, should, cost."
towertycoon93,Two days before the day after tomorrow
DxFrz,"Generic game is in fact generic. Wow, how surprising."
Hyper_red,NGL this is pretty funny
SwordfishUpbeat7774,When copying your classmates homework enters the real world.
foundmonster,I love this shit. Games goin down and it‚Äôs the most entertaining shit to watch them tumble and burn. What a bunch of fuckin morons.
burrito-nz,"This needs to be shared everywhere. Such an embarrassment to the game development community, I feel bad for the people working on the game. The only things I know about this game is that it either never existed and they just rushed something out the door to say ‚Äúlook, we have something for you!‚Äù (Which by the way looks boring as hell), and that it‚Äôs been in development hell with a developer who has bitten off way too much for them to chew. I don‚Äôt see how this will end well for the developer."
CoraxTechnica,Funding scam
SpikeRosered,"I presume they are defrauding investors. It's the only explanation.

They're producing work as they figure out how to dissappear with the money."
crypocalypse,The Day Before... Also known as Yesterday.
Newguyiswinning_,"Who actually thought this wasnt a scam? It you think it isnt, im sorry but that nigerian prince you gave money too will not be contacting you again"
shewy92,15k upvotes to 31k downvotes for the IGN gameplay vid lol.
DDBKAHUNA,"As Limmy would say ""it's a scyamm"""
Unf0cused,At this point I wouldn't be surprised if this game was being made by AI.
alex_dlc,It‚Äôs so blatant
C0NIN,"Looks like their Steam page has been taken down as of today, February 5th, 2023."
BisexualCactusNoises,I was under the impression that we were all quietly agreeing that this game is absolutely a copy of every other apocalypse title out there with the benefit of getting to explore it with friends.
Unwoundsteak1769,It doesn‚Äôt exist
Check-West,AI developed games is here
SergeantRogers,Wow thats a blatant scam.
The_Duude_Slayer,Most elaborate fake game
ShinigamiKiba,XD God this game is such a scam
