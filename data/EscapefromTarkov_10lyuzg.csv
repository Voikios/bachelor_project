Origin240sx,Today is a momentous day
B23vital,Fml man i break my arm fuck my nerves and BSG makes the best changes I’ve seen since i started playing.
SirKillsalot,We're eatin good today.
alolaloe,"This is it, this is the change that was so important. I tried multiple guns, from M4 to Val, AK74N, shitty modded, semi modded. It feels so fucking good."
Justaguyhilol,"Lol what the fuck BSG is on a tear.

Are they sober after New Year's or something? Still, either way, fucking based.

😶👍🏻"
Forrest02,INJECT ALL THE QOL BUFFS DIRECTLY INTO MY VEINS BSG.
DanskJeavlar,Going forward I will refer to this day as Nikitmas
BritishShoop,"yes! 

YES! 

**YEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!**"
Spirit117,Has anyone checked on Nikita lately to make sure he's OK?
XingaBoy,yo what the FUCK lmao
jakelewisreal,"Nikita: I’m sick of everyone bitching, just give them what they want

😂"
Cyser93,U mean after the change hours ago or in that?
KingfisherC,"BSG: *Makes the recoil better*

Some idiots on Reddit: C*omplain about the fixed recoil*

BSG: ***Fix the recoil even more >:)***"
Sufficient-Leading11,Remember to scream and shout praise with the same gusto as criticism
Galgenvogel1993,"Wait, they are fixing Tarkov? Am I fucking hallucinating?"
Sesleri,Mp7 and p90 nerfed in this update too.
Acetocy,"Fast forward a week: 

Reddit: ""I'm so tired of no recoil meta guns. I quit."""
ApeOfDiamondz,Fucking nice!
mightbebeaux,"i haven’t played in two years, and this patch just might be the one to lure me back in."
FlawlessRuby,"I didn't believe I was gonna say that, but those change actually makes me want to try the game again. The game still have many flaws, but at less I can just jump in and shot shit for fun!"
not1fuk,My god this one feature was 90% of the reason I am mediocre at this game compared to other shooters. It full on blinds me because I have astigmatism. If this was really reduced I can actually play the game again.
PalladinoBR,I guess the m1abrams are already working in our favor boys!!!
austnme,YESSSS
Alpha433,"OOTL, what does camera recoil mean and how does it translate into gameplay?"
aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,"It's great, if course it's great. I just wish it didn't take the 1% of the streamers with big views and a long lengthy video to have obvious changes made in over a year.

If they played their fucking game they'd probably have it fixed in a week when they noticed the recoil was complete and utter ass."
VNG_Wkey,"Nice, only 80% more to go."
eithrusor678,'Everyone liked this'
Gadsden_Rattler,I love this but also hate that it took one streamer making a video instead of listening to the entire community
SourceNo2702,Guys I think I’m not going to make it
GardenofSalvation,I want to sex the Russian man
Joeys2323,Let's fucking go dude
KeKinHell,"Come oooooon! We are so close to greatness!

Now just reduce first shot recoil and make burst/tap/single fire more viable! Please!"
NotRiceProfile,"Ok guys, how long until we will start complaining about lazer beam meta?"
NotARealDeveloper,-50% would have been the best value (as seen in various mo'dded tarkov clients). But I take it!
ThePatchelist,"HEY BSG

while you're at it, add tagging to backpacks and rigs please

thank you <3"
TheDeeMurk,Can’t wait to still miss my shots and get rolled the fuck over
MiguelCC1,The one piece is REAL!!
MrRainbowCow,Then they say sike and remove the changes
flubawub,Shit I was wondering why my ak's felt so sharp today
FroyoAgreeable,Wow looks like they finally listened after how many years lmao
c235k,Damn easiest update in tarkov makes players the happiest. Come on nikita
buckets-_-,"me: it'll be easier to kill pmcs :D  

also me: i'm a pmcs D:"
129912994,"Community cries for eternity = no dev cares

1 streamer makes video = instant reaction"
diimitra,"I've always been shit at this game, always played shit guns, I'm afraid I won't even see a difference.
This wype I'm only playing double barrel gun, let's see if I can spot the change lol"
phildunfyy,"So they create a problem, ignore it for a longggggg time, then are forced into fixing it, we praise them. Genius!"
Kibouhou,This subreddit should apologize lmao
mrshandanar,Wow player count must be that bad huh?
JGRIFF123,"Jesus Christ it’s happening. Take me back to the days where there was no weight limit, no FIR, and no worries. Game was in its prime then and these are great steps back in that direction

Also bring back armored rigs and body armor at the same time lol"
SwiftBetrayal,"Players highlight issue = ignore


Streamer highlight issue = hot fix."
kloti38,"Man I had 9 PMC kills in 40 raids, now I have 4 in like 3. Im landing one shot headshots suddenly with just base guns + bastion and some scope. I just killed two guys on customs in 10 seconds and I fired total like 4 bullets. Too bad I got third partied by someone soon after but I almost downed that one too"
Dapper_Beginning3591,Godbless Veritas
TECHNOV1K1NG_tv,REJOICE!!!
LeRenardS13,Hows about by 100%. Camera recoil is not a thing IRL.
mopeyy,"No but really, thank fucking god. 

Now just lower it by another 50% and I'll start crying."
hillbillydeluxe,And the audio?
thenkz,Best tarkov update maybe ever.
yomeroni,Holy
wallywot,AH FUUCKING GREAT
realreinjurings,Wait what no way
shredthesweetpow,It’s like when she says yes
SlappyFlapjack,They are taking feedback and making the game better.  Awesome!
aaronsisco,AS Val SQUAD GET IN HERE
Responsible-Problem5,"Imagine if they sctually did not do anything to recoil, and it is just pure placebo effect lmao"
ARB_COOL,I might actually try the game again
Gaziel1,Make that 50%!
Imaginary_Act5759,Has anyone tested? How does it feel? I’m at work for the rest of the day so Id like to kno
Spartan_8035,W
kashmoney59,"I gotta say, today was a good day."
gabymoka,Is this aside of the already mentioned changes around 7hrs ago? Or part of it?
Enchantedmango1993,Used a stock Fal and damn thing still kicks lime a donkey kill sanitar and his goons with it tho so cant complain
doodleBooty,Is this on top of the changes made yesterday??
acemac,Does it matter is anyone even playing this game without a aim bot anymore?
yp261,"so after 6 or 8 years of a game trying to be “realistic” they finally managed to make shooting more realistic

nice i guess."
Ocean_Cat,Is this another hotfix or the same one that BSG tweeted?
thenotoriousnatedogg,Shit I might actually come back to the game now
Disastrous-Reality61,time to pull out my SA58 and have a blast...
Unlikely_Air888,do i have to update my game to get this or does it automatically happen?
hsjdjdsjjs,"Couldnt test, first raid I looted a dead pmc with a modded 74u and an ak74, second raid I went in a raid with it, died to a guy camping a door, closed thegame and went on LoL lmao. Not a single shots fired"
Legitimate_Film1035,Is this real life?
YBHunted,There aren't any actual metrics we can see to show the player count before these changes are there?
FUCK_YEA_GLITTER,GIGANTIC W
roflwafflelawl,"Just need audio to be looked into to make this game feel good to play again. 

Not in general or anything, just personally (though I'm sure others feel the same)."
welter_skelter,Today is literally Christmas.
Sm0kebringer,"When I full auto with a M4 at 74 vertical recoil, it still going to the sky, is this normal ?  **Genuinely asking**"
unibomber24,Thank fucking god
Wingklip,Hopefully next they make semi auto weapons fire at their full rate again. Saiga-12k factory  spamclick is sorely missed
ProfetF9,"so, what patch are they doing now? :)))"
CHOOSEAUSERNAMEYAFT,Nice. 20% of the way there.
FACEIT-InfinityG,"for the love of all that is holy, keep the top tier ammo rare as fuck."
Arel203,"Fuck man I just recently started playing cities skylines again. Don't do this to me.

I really did not expect BSG to do fuck all considering they generally don't care about people's ideas or feelings if it goes against their design philosophy.

It'd still be nice to see more communication on these topics instead of just silent fixes, but I appreciate it very much regardless."
PetePedroPetey,I’m wanting to see slow mo video footage comparisons of guns before the hot fix and after the hot fix to see how it looks
Latenightlatex234,O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!
Ray_K5350,Man what a great timing  to be on a holiday
CeramicTilePudding,Lol thank you veritas
smackup4u,Wait what? I am on vacation. Damn you BSG! 😎😎
iLLolly,wait on top of the horizontal recoil or were they added at the same time?
fpsgamer2,I think this patch will be remembered and talked through EFT for many years lol.
Wulfik3D42O,"Man, it feels like we had a massive drop off of players with all these changes coming in, and yet I still don't feel like playing again after 2 weeks without it. It wasn't bad since wipe, and these changes are good, but I still can't find any drive."
338special,"So now when I shoot a guy as fast as I can fire from 5 feet away with SKS, I'm going to hit him? I might just come back in then."
smittyK,Nice. CoD kiddies can rejoice finally
r3itheinfinite,how is this THAT BIG of an issue at this point tho AN ENTIRE TWENTY PERCENT
Tankeverket,"""just"" as in much earlier today"
Fair-Astronaut-3025,Camera shouldn't have recoil
InLoveWithInternet,Already posted.
Ishaboo,Damn this actually makes me DEBATE on reinstalling the game after....3 wipes?
HZ4C,Can we also make so “noob” ammo types more viable? Feels bad to shoot some with a whole mag out of a 74u and they just walk away like it’s nothing
