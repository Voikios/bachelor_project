EdgeCrusher157,"Why do you own over $1,000 worth of Joy-Cons"
lienmarine86,"You can just send them in and get a free set from Nintendo. Of my three sets, only one had drift. Send them in and in a week had a brand new set for free."
PsycoticANUBIS,This seems like a ridiculous waste of money.
-churchmouse-,You should try the off brand controllers. No drift.
Sieze5,The Tokyo Drift is strong with the one.
samtrois,Fool me 11 times....
Fr-day,Instead of fixing them you just keep buying more ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
IntroductionCheap325,Get the Pro Controller instead
MajinBuuMan,"I'm still using my launch day Switch with original Joycons....

Bought new control sticks off Amazon earlier this year for like $20 or something and that's all I did was put in new sticks.  The kits they sell come with all the tools and picture instructions."
cheetocruises,I've never gotten joy con drift and typing this out feels like I'm jynxing myself but I had to put it out there
yourfrigginguide,They are literally free to repair from Nintendo. What are you even doing
DiscoJango,"1. Op showing how stupid they are
2. Nintendo going, see, easy money, we can literally make 7 x the profit from defective products!"
WhiteHawk77,"WTF, every one has joycon drift?  Damn you unlucky.  I‚Äôve got two pairs, and my partner has two pairs on here Switch, both had them for years and none of them has drift.  The only thing I have is the player 1 light on one of the two joycons on my original pair has stopped working recently."
BuckieJr,"Launch model Switch with BotW. Red and blue joycons still have no drift. Oled model bought on launch day, drifted day one lmao. My original joycons are champs."
,[deleted]
lasvegashomo,Did you buy new switches for the special edition controllers?
AviRei9,"I think I'm finally experienced this drift everyone keeps talking about It's not hindering to my ability to play my games.  sometimes it feels like my joycon will move my characters, Just randomly to the left but they don't keep going
 It's like they just they take a couple of steps and then stop.  I wonder if this is what people were talking about but it doesn't hinder my gameplay. I've never had my characters tilt to the left or move to the left when it was important, it's never got me killed or anything but I have noticed it. I just release the joycon slightly leans to the left or something. But it fixes itself after like a second."
Excellent_Intentions,"I have launch day joy cons that have seen a huge amount of use, including close to a year by a 4 year old. I have zero drift and I've no idea if I was seriously lucky or what the hell other people are doing to them."
ki700,Send them in for repair. It‚Äôs free.
TheBlunkus,Why would you buy a faulty product intentionally? What is the matter with you?
naab007,"Why give them that much money?..  
just open up and repair them, it's simple.  
[iFixit guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Joy-Con)"
Brillian83,"You know, Nintendo repairs drift for free‚Ä¶"
x16900,Probably how many ps4 controllers I've had. And they all drifted...
ConsistentAddress772,So much wasted wealth.
ffigu002,Why keep supporting shitty hardware?
Eh_C_Slater,"If you buy electrical contact cleaner and spray it into the joystick it gets rid of the drift. Done it on 2 joycons, 2 ps controllers and 1 Xbox one."
Noobphobia,But why?
LonkToTheFuture,"If all of them really have drift, then you either have extremely bad luck or there are external factors contributing to the stick drift, like misuse, dirty fingers, etc."
Kear_Bear_3747,It‚Äôs funny when people post their poor life decisions as a flex
BfMDevOuR,I've been using the same joycons I got with my switch in 2017 wtf are you guys doing to yours?
Galakordi_Urtis_Krat,"No offence hey, but this is fucking stupid. All those pieces of garbage managed to fuck up and what you do? Buy a different colour combination. Kudos. It's thanks to people like you we have cheap overpriced shit that's built to fail."
MacaroniEast,"Joycons are such weird controllers. They don‚Äôt do anything better than any other controller, they‚Äôll always drift, and they‚Äôre terribly designed in an ergonomic sense, yet some people (looking at you, OP) buy them like they‚Äôre being taken off the market. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Nintendo FOMO or what, but it‚Äôs crazy how much people will let slide."
Lumi_Rockets,That...is a lot of money in one picture. Wow.
RegionalTrench,Someone has $$$
chucksstuntman,Mine are original and don't drift. Maybe because I don't play switch that much compared to ps5. But I do have a few hundred animal crossing hours lol
O_o-22,"So I have a switch, I don‚Äôt play an excessive amount of time and am still on my original set of joycons. So I‚Äôm not really aware but these things will eventually be moving in the game even if my hands aren‚Äôt doing anything correct? 

I should also mention I have an original NES from the 80s with 20 games and the controllers still work and function as normal even with childhood me throwing them around when I got mad? Planned obsolescence is some straight up BS, get your shit together Nintendo."
jellyfishbbq,Jesus christ what a waste of money
Imminent_Extinction,"You know what *doesn't* drift? The Nyxi Wizard, the 8BitDo ~~Pro 2~~ *Ultimate* Controller, and the GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro Wireless Controller. They're drift-proof."
TH4T1B34N3R,My launch day joycons don't drift. I must be the luckiest person alive.
S1ayer74_Pez,If ‚Äòall‚Äô of those drift then your doing something wrong.
Kindly_Region,That's sad
MaddenJ222,I can show you just as many PS4 controllers I bought over the years that all have stick drift as well.
SteroidKecleon,"my pair has yet to start drifting , but you should get some third party hardware, or just switch to pc and use an emulator instead of supporting a company that purposely sells defective products"
ILostMyBananas,Idiot.
dododave23,What kind of a joycon collection would it be if they didn't have drift
Help_An_Irishman,Sell them for a Steam Deck and be happy already.
nu_nu_eden,"Look im just gonna say this now,  I've had a couple joy con pairs , and i play warface all the time , and b never had a problem w aiming w the gyroscope. So if 10 DIFFERENT joy cons fail , it's the program dude"
FFVIIVince10,"You can use contact cleaner to spray inside the joy stick and it helps remove the dirt/residue causing the drift issue. Works most of the time.

You can also try recalibrating it in the switch settings."
ToolPhish,Electronic Contact Cleaner. Magic in a can. 8 bucks off Amazon and fixes drift in seconds. You're welcome.
archerl892,Oof
_mister_pink_,"What makes me sad about the joy cons is that sort of puts a hard time limit on the lifespan of the switch.

I still have my DS and my GBC and I still pick them up and play them occasionally and they work as well as they day I bought them.

One day in 20 years time I‚Äôm gonna be nostalgic for my classic Switch and fire it up and the drift is going to make playing impossible and none drifting controllers are going to be so expensive online."
Unstupid,"How‚Äôs that saying go‚Ä¶ Fool me once shame on you, fool me 13 times, buy a pro controller ?  üòÇ"
Keldr,"I remember when game controllers lasted, dag nabbit."
DasJokar,I have had my joycons since 2017 and they haven't managed to drift yet. How in the hell have you managed to make your pokemon scarlet and violet joycons drift already?
kittentron247,"I have the same pair of joycons since 2019 with daily use still no drift
Wtf u doin?"
Elias_from_Nowhere,This cant be true
Biglemonsqueeze,I sent my 2 drifting pairs into nintendo for repair a couple years ago and have had no issues with them since
Stinsation18,"New title,  ""I spent hundreds of dollars buying the same product over and over even though they all kept presenting the same defects."""
SonofGondor32,What are you doing to them? How do you have this many that drift? Are you throwing them? I have had my switch since launch and only had to replace one pair.
Bashir639,You could have either fixed them yourself or sent them in to be fixed for free. This is just an insurmountable waste
ben1481,"/u/redlord990 muted the notifications for this post, make sure you mention him so he seems his stupidity"
Fober,I‚Äôve had one pair for 4 years without drift.
Arcturyte,"Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt have drift? üò¨

‚úäüèΩ ü™µ"
Due-Escape,The fact you didn't learn how to DIY replace the analogs on your 2nd or 3rd replacement astounds me.
Accomplished-Ad8458,Jeez.. i got only one pair that came with switch and it doesnt drift...
MenmaC,‚ÄúThey all drift‚Äù f*cking SENT me üòÇ
jordonmears,You'd think you'd stop wasting money on em and get a decent console
LaserArcher,Thanks Nintendo for making the best e-waste on the planet
kino6912,Contact cleaner. Check it out. It worked for my scuf
Emmy182,"Get yourself a can of WD40, super easy drift fix"
hurshy,I have 2 and none of mine drift.
Minitte,"Even though they drift, the colors are so good"
The_Taco_Enthusiast,A little bit of WD40 under the flap of the joystick itself and give it a good 5 minute wiggle. Worked like magic for me.
jjBeherit,"Drift is such an easy issue to fix yourself, idk why people are still banging on about it."
Sevekol,"You know that you can send them in to Nintendo and have them repaired for free, right? I did it myself"
Ambitious-Access7910,it hurts knowing you have atleast 4 switches
Overall_Sun5609,I‚Äôve had the same one since I‚Äôve gotten the switch and I have no stick drift so idk maybe I just don‚Äôt play my switch enough which would make sense
Think_Palpitation42,Place a warranty issue. I just received new replacements for free on a switch bought at toys r us. I don't remember the year bought...
WarmasterCain55,I got the pro controller when I got my switch.  No issues yet.
Sol-idSnake,"This strikes me as tragic. For some reason, you're sinking money into a product that doesn't even perform properly. What's the point? You're being scammed. Sell all this shit and move to a system that respects you as a customer."
shawnnotshaun,"Well that right there is why the Drift still happens, people just go buy more Joycons."
SleepyBoyFlex,I always just spend the $12ish and 20ish minutes to get replacement joysticks and swap them out
ejiggle,"How in god's name are you possibly playing enough switch that ALL of these drift? I have all of these, except the 3 special editions, and have never experienced drift in anything but my launch set lol"
Master_Freeze,"Send üëè them üëè to üëè Nintendo üëè 
Instead of buying new pairs over and over."
CritikillNick,What a waste of money for colored mediocre controllers that stop working properly quickly. Pro controllers are better in every way
discoshrimpo,Dude $20 will buy you a repair kit. It takes 15 mins to do 2 controllers
milkstrike,"Company sells overpriced defective product and refuses to fix it, LETS KEEP BUYING MORE OF THAT PRODUCT THATLL SHOW EM"
ZsaFreigh,How the hell is that possible? Which Nintendo games are you putting that many hours in to burn through so many controllers? I still have the joycons that came with my day 1 Switch and they don't have drift... But I've probably only played 500 hours total on the console since launch.
Rebresker,"So with those I would go here 

https://www.ign.com/videos/nintendo-switch-how-to-fix-joy-con-drift

It‚Äôs not too bad of a repair.

I‚Äôve been buying ‚Äúbroken‚Äù joy cons once in a while, fixing them, maybe customizing them with a skin or some paint if there was other damage, and selling them in addition to other side hustles‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve also had good luck just returning them to walmart for a new set and saying I don‚Äôt have my receipt‚Ä¶ ymmv

I say it‚Äôs easy but I‚Äôve been fixing my own consoles and controllers since I was a kid and my ps2 quit on me‚Ä¶ so easy might be relative. I get downvoted to hell anytime I suggest self repair as an option on here. Even more so in the nintendo subreddit lol. If my 12 year old self could bring his ps2 to life I‚Äôm sure most adults can do some simple repairs following youtube videos."
elibou440,Copium for your skill issue
Epic_DVB,"Do people not know how simple it is to fix the drift yourself? As long as you have the right tools, the right tutorial and a steady hand then you're good. Pretty sure it's cheaper than buying a new controller too."
krombeaupolis,Take better care of your controllers
Michallin,"one word

Steamedeck"
fudgeingcookies,I spent 12 dollars and 10 minutes to fix my controller drift
yukwot,The heck you guys do to controllers? I play on mine like daily for 2 years and no drift.
TechnicalOtaku,"""yes i have bought a defective product, don't only not  judge me for buying the same defective thing 13 in a row times after despite knowing the 2nd was shit or the 3rd was shit or the 4th was shit or the 5th was  shit... etc. etc.

please praise me for it. ""responsible consumer""

nintendo fanboys ""their hardware is amazing as long as you buy new controllers every month""

meanwhile i still use my 10+ year old 360 conroller.

I'm prepared for the downvotes, yes i know i bought 1 thing that lasts over a decade while he bought 13 things at the same price  A PIECE so 13x what i paid and is now posting his broken on purchases  items for sympathy.  


i think the proverb goes fool me once.. fool me twice... not fool me 13 times. nintendo isn't to blame, you are."
gogul1980,If this were xbox or playstation they‚Äôd have been raked across the coals so hard they‚Äôd have to issue new controllers to everyone. Nintendorks love the plinky plonky sounds of Mario so much they‚Äôd put up with anything.
bwj7,I honestly don‚Äôt know what some people do are they like fucking their joy cons and putting the away wet? I‚Äôve had a switch since day one and I‚Äôve only ever bought 2 sets of joy cons one because of drift and once because of the design.
Xadmon6,Over $1400 CAD in controllers. I'll never buy a switch lmao
IdealIdeas,"You could buy these [replacement sticks](https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/526505.html) and sell off a bunch of them.  
These sticks will never drift, as they are Hall Effect sticks."
Alucardmi,If you ain't out of control you ain't in control
JustJeyYeyplz,"This is the saddest thing I've seen today, besides my romantic life, that shit is deader than Jonathan at the end of PB"
Dud-of-Man,"so none of my controllers ever drift, ps4 and switch have never had a problem with any drift issues. I play games probably 10 hours a week, am i just lucky? Or are you guys just using them alot more?"
Justin2982,*Laughs in never has had drift
Daniseternal,First off why do you need so many and 2 I have never once had my joy con's drift and they are the ones that came with the system and I've had it for years. Store your controllers better and that won't happen.
God1is1love,"At some point you should ask yourself ""is it the controller or something that I am doing to them?"""
LadyLazaev,Am I the only person without joycons that drift? I've got the Monster Hunter: Rise ones.
brutallyhonestJT,"Still have the same controller since launch. No issues or no problems at all.

I think some people just need to NOT hold their controllers like an Ape."
AttorneyAdvice,OP is an idiot. a rich idiot but still an idiot
koningVDzee,Couldv bought a nice PC for that.
Nyuusankininryou,What a total waste of money.
Prideless0,This is some r/tomorrow shit right there bud
infamousmessiah,I actively dislike you as a person based on this alone
SiTwentyFour,What a waste of money on one of the worst consoles ever released!
liltwizzle,You are part of the reason Nintendo doesn't fix this you suck
Mysterious_Fennel459,TIL OP is really easy to grift.
ScripTorin_,"I see nothing wrong here, clearly OP is a collector and is willing to spend the money on the joycons (drift or not). It‚Äôs not ‚Äúwasting money‚Äù
It‚Äôs something they enjoy.."
redlord990,"Bros I‚Äôm gaggin, they don‚Äôt drift. Like two of them do. Calm down cats"
