RealLifeDeadpool,Due to the fact that the comments have spiraled into insults this post's comments will be locked for now.
Megustanuts,I killed him last wipe. He actually called that someone was camping the East to West skybridge in Shoreline (I was). As soon as he sprinted I peeked and one tapped him. Didn't even know he was a streamer but I assumed he was since he was level 52 at the time and I looked up his name on twitch. All I saw on his VODS were people saying I was cheating. Thankfully he didn't think I was cheating and wasn't going to ask BSG to ban me.
imdoublecheeckedup,That’s fucked
StandardScience1200,"Remember when a bunch of users got hardware ID banned for having a certain motherboard and BSG did nothing about it? In fact they removed posts about it in attempts to suppress it happening. It wasn’t until a streamer bought an account, showed it was clean, opened the game on a PC with the motherboard brand in question and it was instantly banned that BSG did anything"
ThatOneMartian,BSG is a fucking joke if they ban people based on video evidence on their 10 tickrate budget servers for things explained easily by desync.
StraightEggs,Upvoting for jmod smackdown
twoscoop,"Is this another one of those, its an admin/sherpa/streamer who gets a player randomly banned.   

This is so wrong.

/u/rengawrlol  his old account"
Fun_Measurement_767,"Maybe a BSG employee on here can shed some light? Apparently they lurk? 

To be honest, I'm not surprised they would do that. Did he suggest that now he thinks you weren't cheating, he'll use those same powers as he abused before to get you unbanned?"
Zaryxo,He doesn't know for a fact you are even cheating. There's no possible way he knows regardless if you are cheating or not. The fact he can get you banned for a suspicion is super cringe.
ejd37,Get this man his account back!
RiskItForTheBiscuit-,"You should blame him, he acted like a big streamer man baby and now you’re out of a tarkov account.  And based on your replies to others here, he didn’t even seem remorseful or wanted to fix it in any capacity, just hush up about it.  Fuck him and fuck any streamer that tried to abuse their status."

PaladinKinias,"This wasn't even a sus death? He got legged, stood in one spot to heal for 30 seconds and then got got? Why would anyone think this is suspicious?

&#x200B;

Like, if everything was head-eyes on full auto, in one second, sure, but 45+ seconds to kill a dude with leg shots? What a manchild."
AbovexBeyond,"Dude tbh, my boy (played thousands of hours with him, I promise he doesn’t cheat) killed Rengawr on Reserve last wipe with an MP9 and GT while strafing past a doorway and he immediately called him a cheater on stream. He’s always been kind of full of it (trying to be nice here).

Big_BossSnake,"Hahaha classic BSG at it again

How DARE you kill a streamer.

RIP OP."
WouterrDitt,Honestly that’s disgusting from both Rengawr and BSG. Just like others said; you literally cannot tell in these situations by your own vod if someone is cheating or not.
mayasux,"I know you said you don't blame him, which like, good for you man.

But we should absoloutely press the blame on this gross misuse of power that's used to take away a paid product from other players. It's shameful and a disgrace.

&#x200B;

edit: I'm pretty sure Rengawr was one of the people with Trey24k who bullied a smaller Youtuber to remove clips after the Youtubers viewers called them out for being crappy in them. 

Stains."
cjhoser,Just shows that even their internal anti cheat verification methods dont exist lol
michaelclimbs,inb4 mods delete this
Computermaster,Well now I'm convinced to never buy this game.
cool_fox,"why do companies/devs constantly make these kinds of mistakes.

rule. 1) dont fucking listen to streamers, EVER

doesnt matter how smart or aligned with your goals they are. They are not employees, they have biased perspectives, and for fucks sake it is such a bad look

&#x200B;

edit: I'm also all for mob rule and getting the streamer banned. Streamers that get players banned are bad for the community and, objectively speaking, should be stopped."
cumquistador6969,"> I don't blame him for the way he reacted



You should, nothing particularly suspicious happened in the clip, he was just being an entitled lil' bitch with a ""I lost mUsT bE cHeAtInG"" attitude.

This shit happens all the time in tarkov, because your information is very limited as a player, that's where a lot of the tension comes from.

Could be desync, a local graphical glitch, your own internet dropping packets, thinking you have a better idea of where shots are coming from than you do, the actual killing bullet coming from a new direction, etc.

This specific scenario absolutely screams typical tarkov netcode problems, rather than looking like potential cheating.

Aside from the fact that bugs are far more common causes, actual cheating would be unlikely to look this suspicious.

A real cheater could have just boosted their movement speed slightly without you being able to tell at any distance, put on no-recoil no-sway, and combined with wall hacks this would have been a trivially easy kill for them that looked nothing different from someone pushing you normally.

They're also not normally going to have trouble penetrating armor since they have constant easy access to the best FIR ammo/weapons.

Obviously he shouldn't have this power, but he also shouldn't be so entitled about it."
Regen89,"Seems he does this a lot too, watched him a fair bit during drops and this kind of thing happened a few times.  ""Don't worry he will be banned in 10 minutes.""  
  
Absolute state of tarkov"
,[removed]
ChubbyInvestor,"What hacks would you even be really accused of using here? You missed more than half your shots. Even the simplest answer is lag/desync. He died to leg, confirmed it himself, you missed a shit ton of shots, and he thinks you are what? Wall hacking/invis hacking but not auto aiming? What's the rationality here. If you're doing the first two, you're certainly doing the last. He thinks you just wall hack/invis for fun or something?

What an idiot."
SopranosBluRayBoxSet,"Wild how much streamers control the game, doesn't seem ethical"
Sylphfury,"Man child streamers like that piss me off and the chat is even worse. The power they have to ruin your account because they can't accept the fact they got clapped, infuriating."
jadenthesatanist,"> First off this is not meant to attack Rengawr in any way, I don’t blame him for the way he reacted

Nah dude, fuck that. Bro got you banned because he couldn’t handle getting killed, and despite being a streamer apparently still hasn’t put two-and-two together that desync and the like exists. Dude deserves to be called out loud and clear."
,[removed]
DabScience,"Rengawr is a loser. No life, horrible personality, accuses people of cheating while standing in the open nearly dead already. Fuck him and fuck BSG for backing him."
UmbraIntus,Small PP behavior from the streamer.
BOER777,"Seeing this kind of shit makes me so mad, and really highlights the state of the game and BSG’s complete inadequacy and mindset. Really hope you get your account back OP, and hope karma comes for Rengawr tenfold"
JamieLannispurr,Everyone talking about how shitty bsg is for this and thats obvious. But FUCK rengwar. Abusing power cause he had a suspicious death in a game he FULL WELL knows has desync and server issues constantly all because he has too big of an ego to accept he died to someone worse than him. What an entitled brat.
I_Delta_Seven_I,"Hope someone sees this and does the right thing. That’s fucked. Sorry, brother."
Pierr0x,So I have to ask people if they're a streamer before opening fire now? There's no way to know if they're a streamer as far as I know.
Shooter503,"Streamers like Rengawr are the worst type of people. What I mean by that is they are the type of douchey person that ABSOLUTELY HATES losing and will get unreasonably mad if he dies which will lead to doing shit like trying to get the person banned who killed him.

You can literally hear the cockiness in his voice when he says he can ""put his whole body back on before this guy even gets to me"" and then gets killed and goes into rage mode.

If you can't handle losing, then don't fucking play Tarkov. I am so tired of these people that can't just relax, take a breath, and move on with life, but instead have to turn into the most spiteful cunts on the planet if something doesn't go their way.

I'm gonna go hit the bong and die on Customs again.

/rant"
ohwhofuckincares,"Honestly, fuck that guy. He gets killed by someone while making as much noise as possible while healing IN HIS MENU standing with his back and whole right side to an open area and assumes cheater. Fuck him and anyone else like him."
DarkLeoDude,"This guy is fucking trash. Dudes just standing with his blacked out legs flapping in the wind next to a rock that doesn't even cover them and he's surprised he gets tagged from behind 'cover.'

I hope you get your account back but let's be real BSG is too incompetent to fix this shit."
PM_ME_BATTLETOADS,I’m getting real sick of BSGs shit.
StarboyGregg,Out of all streamers im not surprised its Rengawr who cries about dying and calls cheats on anyone. Hes the same guy who flexes getting max traders in 4 days cause hes got nothing better to do in life
kym111,"Its amazing how BSG give these streamers power to just ban players as they see fit. The amount of mental gymnastics to arrive to that decision is beyond me. 

I do hope you get your account back brother."
cuddlepwince,Get the pitch forks out this streamer is trash
Event82Horizon,"It's even more fucked that they are likely not going to unban you because it would prove even more how absolutely trash their anti-cheat system is and is enough that a streamer cries about it to get manually banned regardless of any actually cheating evidence.

Incredible professionalism."
SolitaryVictor,"Yet another reason to not play this fucking game. It doesn't matter if he will admit it, and even if you will get unbanned. You got REAL lucky you were able to deduce a guy might be streaming and actually got proof of it for him to admit he was just a salty bitch. And here I thought Rengawr was actually a worthwhile streamer for once. 

The fact that he can just go and ban you on ASSUMPTION of cheating, even if he didn't do it directly but just asked someone who could do it. 99% of other people who will just get randomly banned like this and won't have proof because they killed someone geared and went searching for fucking idiots on twitch to prove their innocence. 

There is no excuse to this. As if all the shit, bugs, cheaters weren't enough to already hate this game, now fucking randos with a stream can just go and get you banned because he didn't like the way he died. 

Fuck. This. Game."
whatsgoingontho,"This guys lvl 53 and a sherpa, clearly has thousands of hours in.  And just ""yep must be hacking, because this game is flawless and desync never happens and i always win""  So sick of these shit stain streamers.  The fact that he can ""personally get him banned"" is horseshit and BSG is a bunch of idiots."
KingfisherC,"Please Reddit, keep defending this company. Sorry OP."
robertodylant,"I watched your clip and part of his VOD. Man, I don't think I've ever hated a streamer so immediately lol. His voice, his dad excuse for a beard, his lack of personality, etc. All bad and clearly a home for his fellow peeps who would rather hide behind a computer screen than face any confrontation in real life. (The irony of posting this on Reddit is not lost on me lol) 

Not only did he get you banned, let his mindless dumbfucks of chat berate you the next day, instantly go to the report button(looked like muscle memory to me) but he wasn't even trying to find better cover. He was standing straight up while fixing his body. Idk about y'all but that just seems like a good way to get killed in raid."
BanditTheBamb00zler,"Dude didn't even play right. Should've had morphine binded in pockets or rig, could have ran to same cover he wasted so much time in, and then use grizzly to heal thorax and head. THEN he could have fought back. Even as a pleb I can still see so many things he did wrong. Then calls cheats. Woof."
imagepreview,Lmfao I remember just before the Christmas event another post was popular because a bsg employee banned a player for just blatantly out playing him. Nothing ever came of that I’m pretty sure sadly but the more shit I see from these people the more I ask myself why I play
Mirroredentity,And yet there are people who have max level flea market 2 days into a wipe selling 10 GPUs at once that don't get banned. What a fucking joke.
Elduroto,"Even hyper chads like Landmark and Pestily don't always scream cheater when killed, to think you're such hot shit that you think all your deaths are cheaters to the point where you can ""manually"" ban people like that is so shit"
PureRushPwneD,"Imagine if you didn't even record what happened from your side? You just kill a guy, go ""wow that was lucky, holy shit he's stacked with loot. dope."" then you go about your business, log on and see your account just banned out of the blue because some of these big streamers can apparently just do that?

The amount of shit I've seen over the years now of people getting banned for no valid reason, and then just being fucked forever.. Jesus christ, it genuinely scares me. 

Me, someone who got into the game and spent probably 150-200€ on the game as I upgraded several times instead of buying the biggest upgrade right away, played 1520 hours now.. and then BSG just goes ""nah we honestly don't care about you, just buy the game again if you want to play so badly"" (yikes if this happened to my WT account, 5500 hours and lots of money in the toilet)

...Just sad. And honestly almost seems illegal. 
What if I bought a car, then the dealership took it back and **kept** my money because I left it out of my garage one day, exposed to the elements? They would get sued .-."
Khazard42o,"Why does he say the last 2 shots that killed him are you thoraxing him? This guy has thousands of hours in tarkov and doesn't know how damage works? You're shooting blacked limbs which causes his other non-blacked body parts to take damage.

Not sure if streamers should have this kind of privilege, most of these guys are idiots who idiot viewers flock to."
TheBestGirlNaoto,">First off this is not meant to attack Rengawr in any way, I don't blame him for the way he reacted  


You should totally blame him this situation is partially his fault no streamer should be able to or try to do this."

SuperRektT,KEKW manual ban but then chinese people with 50karma selling 27 graphic cards not banned for wipes hAhA
Frig-Off-Randy,Hope you get it back if you really are legit. Reminds of the time Pestily complained about the mosin and they changed the cost of the ammo live while he was streaming
Cydocore,"Honestly, the most fair thing Twitch should do now is to ban Rengawr until OP is unbanned from Tarkov. Making someone lose a product they paid for and invested their time in because you’re a butthurt little bitch is literally ban worthy. Let’s see how he likes it when his time and money are taken from him."
mister_rection,"This is super messed up, but not surprising. BSG gives way too much power to streamers. In no world should a player/streamer be able to get someone's account manually banned. I hope you are able to get you account back soon.

I would hope Rengawr would be man enough to admit his mistake and help you out but honestly he doesn't seem type to admit he was in the wrong and take responsibility."
magooballs,Honestly if the stream goes around banning everyone who kills him in game then he should be banned.  Dudes clearly beyond toxic banning casual players who beat him because he's trash.
Greenmanssky,"When Rengawr first started coming up and getting big with the cycle beta, he wouldnt even give out the free fucking keys until more people subbed to him and stayed subbed on youtube. he's a whole ass bitch, and deserves no support"
DickeTitten69,"You should blame him. Fuck this guy. He is an arrogant fuck. He thinks he is above a shitty implementation of multiplayer over the internet? This fuck thinks his lag is -1 ms and could never be a victim to shit netcode or latency? 

Nah fuck that. Let this fucking piece of have it. Fuck BSG for defending these fucking streamers too and giving them this much power."
flatspotting,Why the fuck do you not blame Rengawr - what kind of absolute loser immediately cries and goes to get someone banned when they die in a game.  I 100% blame the giant man-baby.
Swag_MGee,Yeah thats crazy how a streamer can get someone manually banned in under 10 mins but he cant go and get the guy unbanned when he realized that it may have been desync. u/urengawrlol where you at.  Also how do streamers hold that much power to be able to get someone banned with a snap of their fingers.  BSG def caters to streamers
RJohn12,rengawr should be personally apologizing if you really didn't hack
DrDop4mine,Lmao what a shitbag Rengawr is for this wow
Lkj509,When the game’s netcode is so broken that a normal firefight looks like cheating to the point where the devs manually ban you
The_Coods,"So any casual gamer can lose their money and progression just because of shit servers- if they kill someone who essentially no-lifes the game. 

And BSG just takes the streamer at their word because they would rather ban one random rather than not take a streamer at their word in front of their community.

Seems like a pretty fucked balance, but there’s really not much of a better alternative at this very moment. BSG just really needs to take the time to implement a working anti cheat. Take a break from releasing the new content for the ADHD gamers who need something new every 2 months to keep their interest."
themobiusmargrave,"Absolutely pathetic act from a streamer, not surprised given who it is though"

GravelsNotAFood,"That doesn't surprise me in the slightest. This game was made for him, And his TTV butt buddies. Any game, where the developers will give this type of power to the streamers, is a scam disguised as a video game. 

Fuck BSG, And Fuck Rengwar"
nighteeeeey,"its absolutely insane to me that developers will give streamers with bean brains this much power over a game like what the fuck

fuck that guy and every streamer that says ""i will get you banned because you killed me therefore you must be cheating"" LOOK AT THE FUCKING GAME CODE YOU IDIOTS LOOK AT THE FUCKING DESYNC DAY IN DAY OUT HOW CAN YOU BE SUCH A VOLATILE LITTLE SHIT TO ASSUME EVERYONE THAT KILLS YOU MUST BE CHEATING im so fucking done with this game and these devs i swear to god

its the same thing pubg did a while ago where they gave whitelisted (OMEGALOL) streamers the power to report anyone for streamsniping and INSTANTLY GET BANNED LIKE WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING DEVS you are killing your game with this"
Hendeith,"Is anyone surprised? Streamers are only ones getting actual customer support in this game. Something wrong with your account? Lost items? Lost progress? No worries, BSG will manually fix it for you. Suspicious death? BSG will manually ban people based on dubious evidence, because BSG's goal #1 is to keep streamers happy. Getting wreckt by some ""non Chad gun""? No worries, give it a week or two and BSG will introduce nerf. Streamers advertise game and bring money. BSG gives them VIP treatment. BSG and streamers are locked in 69 position blowing each other ever since streamers caused Tarkov popularity to explode.

But if you are normal player and can't login cause you are not receiving code, lost access to mail then you are fucked. When their butthurt dev or mod manually bans you cause you killed him then you are double fucked."

,Yeah ima stop watching Rengawr now bc that was pathetic. “Cheating” Just bc he never saw you? The shot clearly came from his left side and he never once looked toward the shot so no shit

bobby10304," New meta is voip that you are streaming and if u kill me your banned. GG. Imma go try it.

Edit: Went to factory. Yelled at scavs. Died. Games broke."
Rankin37,Sure does say a lot about the state of the game that people are so quick to call cheater on anyone who kills them. Is this really the reputation BSG wants for their game?
ButterMakerMoth,"I watched some of his videos on YT and went to see a stream.  He's just a blatant d-Waffle. People will ask him honest ,new player questions and he will reply like they are literal children and berate people who talk about what he's doing.  Twitch timmy: *Why are you going to power?* ""I just said I was going to power to check for car, tf do you mean . Pay tf attention, damn"". 
 maybe they just hopped in and aren't sure what's going on .I watched him run over a knoll, stop. Whiff a shot. Then get shit on.  ""Yeah he wasn't hacking/s""  ...calling hacks bc you missed the shot. He saw you . His shot hit. That's tarkov. His YT videos are just click bait with b.s titles now too. He's gotta be the worst streamer iv watched lol. How he interacts with people and just constantly strokes his own ego is weird. He doesn't have a personality for streaming so I don't understand at all how he got traction."
sktwocan,"Rengawr is one of the cringiest tarkov streamers (and there’s a lot of them), all it takes is one look at him"
nukoservioss,Rengawr has always seemed like the ultimate asshole to me and a lot of others. There's a reason the whole guy is a meme in most of the other tarkov streamers chat.
KUhockey05,"Rengawr is the most cocky, arrogant, annoying streamer I have come across so far."
CaptainTortillas_,What a fucking prick. Lol. Fuck that streamer and fuck BSG for giving him this power
Dremlar,"No streamer should have the ability to influence bans. Too many just jump to cheating. I'm not even saying I believe OP. Just that the power should not be in hands of active players. They should report, it should be investigated, and determined by BSG what the right call is. If they want to fight against that, then sure argue for a tribunal system, replays, kill cams, etc. Don't give them this power as it is clear it is abused. Not just by this streamer, but we have seen others pull similar shit.

Hopefully Rengawr actually apologies for jumping to action like that, but my expectation is he doesn't give a shit and feels justified in what he did. Just inflating the ego and power and creating more issues without fixing root cause of desync and actually having a system to identify cheaters that works at the speed the community desires (such as a tribunal)."
Key_Enthusiasm_1757,"The fact that somebody who sits at home all day playing video games has any power anywhere at all is cringe.

Like the guy just plays the game and bsg is like yes because people WATCH you we will give you power in our company. That’s pretty sad and something only bsg would let happen. Could you imagine how many kids would be banned if Ubisoft or epic did this"
xdavidy,"Quote from the clip:
> He has to left-hand peek me ... so I have to see his whole body before he sees me

This is only true if the peeker is not farther away from the edge of the rock (by some margin) than himself. As he is close to the edge of the rock, it's entirely possible for him to be killed without seeing the peeker, regardless of netcode.

Although him not seeing you after some movement looks like netcode problems, he still shows little understanding of how angles work in shooter games. That a BSG dev banned you for this clip, in a game where desync of **multiple seconds** is allowed to occur, is in my opinion completely ridiculous."
tyler_the_noob,"It's not a witch hunt or a call out to address him personally, as he was the one that personally got OP banned. So /u/Rengawrlol what is up? why are you such a little crybaby?

Zer0Cyber_YT,"Killed hodsyy once and she accused me of using aimbot because I shot her in the face three times with a low recoil AK while she had a face shield, can't remember the name but it was on this black helmet with gold furnish. I think it was called ops core or something? I only have about a hundred... Maybe two hundred hours and have never been geared before, best I ever got to was trader level 2."
allbusiness512,"Between BSG admin banning another guy and now it looks like BSG just taking Rengawr at their word and just flat out banning this guy, seems like we really need to start questioning whether BSG is just manually banning out of the blue for no reason."
Sesameg,I hope the bsg employees in here see this and can shed more light on the situation.
ampleenan,This is really fucked up
RfL222,Ooof this is so cringe man. Best of luck OP.
Y0cub,"I was once banned and then unbanned in this game, it fucking sucks and its a joke. No streamer should have that kind of power, i had a desync on labs where he thought i was flying but in reality i just desynced until i ended up right in front of the streamer. I showed my clipped pov and was able to fight for my 3k hour account back."
FEIKMAN,"You know, I would expect a guy who plays the game 8h/day to be more consistent with the accusations, what is possible and what is not.

Say what you want, but just the fact that he jumped to the ""ITS A HACKER"" in a split of a second after getting killed in one of the most bugged games out there, is just either an EGO thing or plain stupidity."
Beneficial-Room5129,"All the real cheaters get a pass. Meanwhile, this guy.."
jaxne1337,"This fucking sucks, I hope BSG can resolve this for you soon. No streamer should have such power with such little evidence and there should be due process or research into the suspect's 
game behavior or account for bans like this. Scary stuff. Rengawr trying to run away from it and ignore it is fucking awful of a sherpa to do too, some accountability would be nice. Dude has a giant ego. 


It kinda sucks, I've been perma-banned from Rengawrs chat because I disagreed with one of his moderators in a different stream over the inertia changes, I didn't even say anything inflammatory lmao."
LookIts_Rain,Average stim inject cod runner streamer mad that holding down left click and w key didnt win them a fight so it has to be a cheater clearly.
lil_ureshii,Yeah I’m never touching this game again. Haven’t played in over a week this basically confirms my uninstall lol
WinstonBabar,"I hate all the special privileges and shit that big streamers get. Maybe it's bc I don't find watching streamers fun or interesting in the slightest but it's completely undeserved and I don't think they should be getting early access or special treatment or anything like that. 

Especially not personal contact with a dev to get someone banned. What a cry baby that guy is."
Exionus,Wow that’s fucked up mate. Hopefully you get your account back soon.
TheLizardSage,Lmao I just got banned from his discord for having a pretty civil discussion about the ban. I’m not advertising brigading whatsoever but feel free to take a look at his discord and the dick riders over there bickering over the immature nature of the guy they themselves subscribe to. Even some of his followers agreed he shouldn’t have reacted that quickly.
AccomplishedRip4871,"This game is fucked.
Perma bans based on strange clips on servers with 10 tickrate, people with 50+ flea rep in 2 weeks after the wipe are not getting auto banned, labs are unplayable because of Chinese cheaters and sounds are even worse than they were before, and I'm not even discussing their item removals from traders which is very subjective.
Sadly Tarkov is the only FPS game I'm currently interested in, if there was a real alternative I would 100% switch to a new game but early wipe experience is the reason why I'm stil playing this permanent beta cheap Russian code made on Unity."
drunkpunk138,"This is still happening, eh? Not surprised, but still disappointed"
Thatoneirish,"Pfft you missed a bunch of shots, dudes a bitch for doing that to you Idc"
attomsk,I’ve been on the receiving end of this type of massive desync and it does feel like a cheater killed you but damn that manual ban is lame
the_internets23,"He’s such a fucking dweeb, what a loser."
vdubbnmclvn,Literally just watched a YT stream and he was fucking annoying at that. Fuck him it sounds like 🤷🏼
DisGruntledDraftsman,"Slow clap as we watch BSG throw the lighter into the soon to be dumpster fire. 

Just when you think they can't be any dumber."
IngenuityThen2773,"Rengawr, what a fucking looser xD"
Ryzze_Up,what a fucking crybaby these streamers can't take dying in a video game
pustulioxd69,Tarkov twitch streamers are some of the most egoistic fucking people in the world I swear.
JKCinema,"yo that shit is so foul. Streamers are the worst. and BSG cares about what they think way to much. It's like they keep changing the game specifically for them and less and less so for casual players. i like how they make the game more popular, but real tarkov players don't really watch streamers like that anyway. Simply because their audio fucks with yours..."
Godunn17,Y’all are just starting to realize tarkov sheet?
TaigaOSU,"Playing this game right now scares me. I have spent tons of money for EoD, and now I hear that killing random guy in the map can make you lose account. Seriously?"
Critical_Quick,"Said it before, I'll say it again, escape from tarkov is 100% tailored to streamers."
Hairy_Helicopter3427,streamers are just entitled baby's whose parents didn't make them get a real job or go outside. Its super cringe that people give money to them
buttermilkbilly,Just don’t kill a streamer whose whole identity is being good at tarkov.
Tingtong_longJohnson,Streamers are such petulant twats.
Ritter18,Fuck that guy.

Jordandavis7,What a bitch
MrFrenchT0ast,"Dude looks like an IRL soyjak meme, what did you expect?"
JebstoneBoppman,"I dunno, in my opinion, you absolutely should blame him for the way he reacted - even if he went back on his initial opinion. He's ultimately cost you whatever you initially payed for Tarkov because he had a heated gamer moment :/  


I wish more games would implement what iRacing has with the ""Cool down period"" of two hours before you can finalize a report of another player."
WindianaJones,The biggest problem in all this is the game/servers being so absolutely awful you end up in situations like this that look suspicious but are in reality just awful desync.  When you can't distinguish desync from cheating you know the game is no longer worth playing. IMO of course.
Guinan_Domination,"thats bullshit they can just cry to the devs and fucking ban a dude with a .35 survival rating, ffs. I like the streamer in mention just fine actually, but to think he is sending clips to get people banned regularly freaks me out, because so many innocent are caught up."
Wise_Wolf,"I really hope you get your account back, it's beyond ridiculous that a streamer can just get you  manually banned without a further look just because they are upset. This should not be happening and should be looked into by someone with some power, whoever is pulling a trigger on someone because a streamer came and cried to them should not have the power they have."
Sheepy049,"Typical streamer mentality, what a bitch"
Numerous_Witness_345,"Ah, Tarkov was going to be the next game I pulled the trigger on getting.. this kind of stuff is convincing me otherwise."
flocker92,"""I reported him and moved on"" ok dude, except that's not what you did..."
dumnem,Wow what a dick. I hope he shits himself so hard he gets a rash
JiffTheJester,Streamers of this game are all man babies. That guy included lol
swafromsteam,"Everyone is acting very disrespectfully towards rengawr in this situation. “Fuck him, he’s childish”. But they are correct, he can’t just blame somebody for cheating when the game has an “apparently” bigger desync issue than the cheater pandemic. When he does end up blaming them he shouldn’t have the power or accessibility to any power and be able to manually ban someone. Then not expect to get blamed for unfairly banning someone because he thinks he’s so good that he cannot die. Pathetic, absolutely pathetic. I hope you get your account back and you can enjoy the game again."
DaHedgehog27,BSG are idiots.. Look at the recent changes :D
Mr_Schmo,"Ya, an EOD player shooting leg meta sounds like a cheater to me /s

Sorry this happened to you. That sucks."
Zavodskoy,"Leaving this post up but please remember any comments calling for people to go harass him on twitch / his social media breaks Reddits sitewide rules on brigading / witch hunts and aren't allowed. 

Rule 3 also applies, no personal attacks or insults."
smellow97,the shit streamers thinking all cheat but suck themself . f this guy ngl and a sherpa aswel dafuck man . let me shoot him with my 12ga sniper at 400m  see him react then ....
ReplicatedSun,"You can have my account if you don't want to rebuy the game, i have no intention of playing. not sure if i can change the information on it or not though"
UrAnacondaGirlfriend,Cringerarw
Socialsecurity0,Hope this gets fixed. Super fucked up that it’s this easy to get banned with no investigation.
spartan55503,"This reminds me of when I killed 3 streamers that were quite frankly very bad and then they called me a ""white name"" and used that as evidence that I was cheating."
Slyons89,Tangentially related; Sadly the reporting system for regular players is practically meaningless since so many times you can report someone for what legit looked like bullshit/hacks on your screen but it was desync. There's so many false reports of cheating that may have just been desync I can't imagine BSG can even review a fraction of them and make a correct decision on bans. And this game has worse desync issues than most others even on low ping connections so this probably happens a LOT.
Odin_Exodus,"While I don’t agree with the ban, it’s not unheard of for respectable players to have that kind of power. Jagex/RuneScape had player mods until a group of them began blatantly abusing the power to a much much more severe degree."
Jonas_Sp,"Honestly people that stream this game are just a different breed, yes there are some people that don't take it to seriously but good lord reading stuff like this just hurts to read"
Teftthebridgeman,"I hate that streamers exist and that games have become so dependent on these vain attention whores and what they think is good or not. 

This game is DOA anyway, Nikita can't even imagine this game being finished, why do we continue to sell new players on something we all know in the back of our heads is just a pile of garbage at this point"
DrZaiu5,A streamer using their position to get someone banned is beyond shitty behaviour. Streamers and everyone else should have to go through the same process for reporting players.
jrfaster,Fucked up
69ing_Giraffes,rengwar is so ugly
hammerfromsquad,This game a joke
Wgairborne,"I *really* want to look at the positives for how BSG is handling this game, but the negatives are seriously outweighing them at this point."
sockosis,"BSG, fix this dudes ban."
vzmike,This is absolute fucking bullshit.
RagingFluffyPanda,"He's outside of cover, gets shot in the legs multiple times (note: no headshots), then stands next to a rock for like 2 minutes that is *still* exposing his legs while talking to chat, then dies, and he's convinced that you're cheating based on that? What a joke. Very disappointed that BSG will do a streamer's bidding with actually zero evidence of cheating."
FastExchange0110,"This is terrible. BSG giving streamers so much power and such high priority and even lately it seems like they're developing the game based off of streamer input is totally fucked. Idk if I can support this company anymore 

Things seriously need to change."
WhyAmIEvenHereJesus,So i went over the vod and i hear when his buddy said “T minus how long until u think that guys gonna get banned” followed by someone saying 20 minutes and then next wipe and then rengawr saying ten. After that i recorded the vod for another 2 minutes and i never heard him say he was going to submit it for manual review. Do you know about how long afterwards he would have said that?
ItsPenguxn,"Escape from Tarkov?

More like Escape from Streamers."
killercake22,imma just say a cheater wouldn't use eko into the legs and cheaters fight further away unless they are selling items for money also they hit most if not all shots thats where streamers need to do their due diligent rather than anger reporting
Mk_Ultra20,"that's a shitty situation, hope you get your account back but with BSG's support history, I wouldn't be too hopeful."
,[deleted]
ConsuelaSaysNoNoNo,BSG needs to correct their obvious mistake.
DelugeFPS,"How tf does he even come to the conclusion you're cheating here? If you were cheating he'd have been dead before he made it to cover.. dude was being super passive taking mad risks trying to heal back up leaving himself wide open.  


What a little shitstain this dude seems to be.. lmfao. Sorry OP, this is wack af."
No_Industry6924,I was always terrified of running into shroud during the PUBG days cause he pretty much accused anyone who killed him of hacking
NICKSIMO2709,bruh the state this game is in bruh
alcoholicprogrammer,"This is honestly ridiculous, streamers have way to much influence on this game. Nobody should be able to just get someone banned on the fly like that, no matter how big they are on twitch, and yeah, I know you didn't post this to disparage Rengawr, but holy shit, this is so extremely petty of him and generally a bad look for him and BSG, and that's coming from a guy who used to follow him on twitch like crazy when I was still learning this game. This is basically the equivalent of a 10 year old in a COD lobby getting dunked on and telling other players ""my dad works for Activision and I'm going to get you banned"", but it actually happened here"
Stelcio,\*adds to mental list of why I don't play Tarkov anymore\*
motarded421,I'm not remotely surprised. I've lost an account to murdering a streamer. Had a Sherpa/Streamer call me a cheater on Customs a few weeks ago after I shot him in the face from Crack house while he was standing on top of the buildings at RUAF. After he had killed the 4 other dudes I was running with.
The_Na_Krul,It's exactly this behavior that has kept me from playing this game even remotely. Between actual cheaters and streamers who have their head so far up their ass they get free parking I honestly don't know how you guys do it.
Scarity,holy shit what a piece of shit
Arkaedy,"Streamers ruined this fucking game. Sure, they popularized it, but holy shit is it a cesspool.

Reng, buddy. C'mon."
banmeplscantstop,This is lame af and on his part just fkn assume ur gettin cheated all the time weak mentality coping
spamdatm4,"the fact that people still buy this dog shit game, when some random fucking nobody streamer who is a literal WHO? is allowed to ban people. but for 7  years these dumb idiots at BSG cant seem to make modern network / servers so their game is not so dogshit that ppl ban ppl because they died with no visual to how garbage their code is.  Maybe STOP promoting a dog shit game. and hire some competent non highschool lowest bid coder you can find.  any1 defending bsg needs to get the D out of their mouth and brush their teeth they have more than enough money to fix this. But of course they wont."
devils__avacado,Stands behind a rock upright to heal then dies while being pushed lol and instantly calls hacks what a moron.
pushernogirl,Rengawr you better fix this what a bitch
attenzionee,"This really makes me wonder, if any person really believes in PvP in this game.

As long as this game has server with a tickrate of 20, there is NO WAY any real competition could take place. Its just not possible from the technical side, and it will never be. Looking forward to the arena and the shitstorm they will receive, regarding rubberbanding and de-sync death on mass.

&#x200B;

Also, this case reminds me of the early ESL days with chat bans via ""report"" sheet and manual ban from an admin who did play in the MR12 FW ladder on rank 520.

Sorry for you, but i think youll get your account back. If not, dont be to sad."
Evening-Tax-9945,"This game will continue to be ass till BSG balls drop and push a kernel anti-cheat + admin observers for the extreme cases where character stats just don't line up being legal. Fuck this nuanced banning method system, Let all the idiots complain about privacy in 2023 imagine the death spiral their UK company would take with any evidence of malous done with the data anyways"
Einlanzer_Atanius,"I dont watch most Tarkov streamers because of this. Pestily seems like good shit overall, I have never noticed him report a sus death before. Anyone who goes through that much effort for losing, without having indosputable proof, is too childish to wield that kind of power. Sorry to hear this"
Hot-Specialist9228,"Manual bans are the only way the cheaters are getting banned and this is the exact reason why you got banned.

The problem is there are so many undetected cheats available and BSG does not know how to handle it so the only thing that they can do is manually ban based on VOD submissions.

This is just more proof on how bad the cheating problem actually is and the fact that BSG has no solution to stopping it.

And here's the real kicker. Cheaters already know that this is a thing and they already have streamers account s locked into their Radars so they can avoid killing them. So now legit players are getting banned and the cheaters are still not getting banned because they know to avoid streamers and Sherpas."
MaskedHeroman,Got it won’t watch him then.
aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,"How does BSG not realize how shit their game is? If you were hacking it would be a bullet in his jaw, there would be no fight. That's so fucking gross that they just simp a streamer and ban a legitimate player just based on one clip.

Secondly, Rengawr is a baby for trying to get you manually banned. That fight was pathetic he just slaps 5 stims into himself and basically heals up, but walks like 12ft and stands in the exact same spot. Any average player is going to pursue, flank and move to engage the player they just damaged. Everyone takes damage in the legs, so if you know you landed shots, you'd be an idiot not to follow up. Any player would be an idiot to just stand there behind a rock in a field."
Gigglen2,Commenting so numbers go up and BSG has to unban or we riot
scrubLord24,"I feel like I've noticed recently from this games streamers that they either seem really great and quite nice, or are absolute bitches that fit all the stereotypes.

This guy clearly falls into the latter category."
Fgw_wolf,"Wow almost like we should have some way of being able to review matches because the game is so fucking broke professionals can't tell if their deaths are legit. Shame theres no possible way to tell.   


Also after watching the video he played like shit lmao. Who the fuck runs their stamina bar to 0 on fucking woods, the map with next to 0 cover and then he tries to fucking surgery himself instead of popping painkillers and getting to actual cover rofl."
Mr_robasaurus,"Streamers do not deserve a direct line to the devs, full-stop. It will be abused like this and it just looks bad - how many bugs/cheaters/exploits get posted daily here that nothing gets done about?"
danjackmom,Can he be reported to twitch for harassment for this behavior? Because if he can you should report him
b_fnk,"They really don't deserve their playerbase - constantly catering to streamers, meanwhile zero support for anyone else, and legitimate cheaters are always having the time of their life in this game. Vote with your time, spend it on another game..."
YogurtclosetNeat9200,Was planning on getting this game but won’t anymore. Devs are losers.
Ok_Shop_3418,BSG cucks confirmed?
kultureisrandy,"Cool, never gonna buy the game due to this"
ABrowseinthePast,Damn bro that sucks. Hopefully someone at BSG will see this but it’s unlikely.
longshot,This awesome game is so fucked
StatutoryApee,"Landmark has calledhacks many times and been proven incorrect too. But it's fucked that BSG will ban because they get told to ban, without checking - fucking pathetic."
Separate-Advance-453,"Have you highlighted this on twitter? Not to flame him but to ask if he can help you get your account back, I mean your post is well thought out and put together in here"
LeButtSmasher,I mean he's always been like this even when he used to play league.
eshelon123,Sad to see this. It really sucks how badly devs just do whatever the top streamers tell them.
VitalityAS,"With the state of cheaters right now I don't even blame the report. I blame the bsg employee who saw your stats and thought that is hacker tier, and I blame rengawr for not doing everything to make up for his mistake."
mandatory5,"It is absolutely mind boggling that they haven't solved this desync problem in 6 years. It is almost impossible to tell the difference between getting hacked on and desync, unless they're rage hacking.

Right on the edge of uninstalling this piece of shit game."
overwatchlap,This needs attention. Streamers and their mods cannot go ahead and influence unjustified bans. Did anyone tag him on twitter yet?
ekohzzz,Happens every time. It's okay. Take it as a sense of accomplishment that you killed a sweaty Tarkov loser who refuses to shower
AddyDarkbabe,"EFT has genuinely gone to shit with this wipe.  Don't even wanna play.  So many cheaters are running around that desync like this just makes you assume it's cheating.  Fix the cheating problem, and you'd know this was just desync."
stelkurtainTM,"BSG is so fucking despicable it's amazing people still play this game.  Streamers must feel so scummy that ordinary people are struggling to get unbanned just because they happen to get in the same game as them.

Perma banned for a suspicion from a VOD LOL"
ken_theman,"Idk, I watched the clip and it really didn't look like you were cheating even from his perspective. I hate to put it this way but had this happened to a streamer like pest I feel like he would've just sucked it up and complained about it in chat but definitely NOT messaged a dev about it. Jesus. I'm sorry dude. I kinda respected rengwar before this but fuck this petty mongrel. Sorry for your loss bruv."
CaptG33ch,"If streamers have any power at all, don't play the game. I boggles my mind that some games will punish someone for stream sniping. You don't want to get found, stay the fuck off your stream."
SRT8JGC,What a tool. Fuck streamers and the people who donate thousands of dollars to let them play video games for a profession
realogsalt,"That's is entirely fucked from start to finish. I don't want to witch hunt or anything, but that being my only take of that streamer makes me massively dislike them. The fact that he reported you, got you banned and after rewatching the clip realized he was wrong is fucking reckless. The dudes job is to play tarkov and he should know what is absolutely cheating and he should know what's possibly not cheating. Never in a million years should someone with that much knowledge, make that accusation so recklessly and then even have the ability to act on it. Fuck that"
voxyvoxy,"Honestly, the only streamer that I support having this kind of undue power is AquaFPS.

Seriously though OP, you aren't the first person this has happened to, and you won't the last either.

Keep in mind that, above all, BSG is an extremely stubborn organization filled with extremely stubborn people, you'd have to move heaven and earth to get them to admit that they are at fault.

TBH, the outlook is not great for getting ANY sort of justice out of this, least of all access to your account, it may just be worth it to bite the bullet and get a new account if you're so inclined."
Dull-Comparison8146,"Please don't be too hard on Rengawr, he already has fetal alcohol syndrome 😔"
ImSunborne,"Typical streamer stuff, their egos have become so massive and can't handle the fact that someone can be better than them or that they're wrong so they immediately assume someone is cheating or ""stream sniping"". 

Honestly streamers should never get benefits or preferable favor like this because it causes a whole slew of problems when their ego gets hurt."
FckDisJustSignUp,"Bro you buy a game, you invest some time in it and they ban you just because you killed a streamer ? No way, keep the clips and send everything to devs, make this move. This is bullshit, I love tarkov but this just can't happen. You need at least a refund or another free version of what you paid for"
m3atpants,"Man, that sucks big time."
tacobellisdank,"Well that's a huge bummer, dude."
Uncle_Bobby_B_,Awful game worse company
bodash,"Wow, an unbelievably devious pk delay. Also, sorry OP. Atleast he helped you escape from tarkov."
sashisashih,this is both super fucked and incredibly unsuprising..
Gabaloo,"Imagine giving streamers this kind of power, what a fucking joke"
matthew_py,Here before the ban lol
Hendo_AU,"The amount of times I've seen this shis happen in Tarkov, glad I gave up playing this game like a year ago."
4onsheep,wth. thats so stupid that you can get banned so easily
EnglishRevenger,It’s like Tarkov is doing everything in its power to make people hate it
Lazerhawk_x,"I mean they are letting streamers make most of the development decisions at this point so why not let them make the call on who gets banned or not lmfao, what a pathetic company."
MomhatezWowDesktop,I bet this guy is hung af
ANTIDAD,The fact that they outsource banning to people other than internal BSG and their automated system is just proof they have no confidence in it.
WayneZer0,yeah this game gets worser and worser. not only from weird changed with out announcement weirdly only after streamers and other nolifers have already overcommed that thing. to weird scav and loot changed. to these weird banns that happend in the last time and the really cheater rmt problem. i really want to play alot this wipe but well after 3 years and seening this game gets worser so much that 3 people did even want to start. yeah this game needs some competion and need to be more transaprent.
SilentReavus,Cool game bsg
ShaddyDaShadow,Nikita pls
AbovexBeyond,The amount of direct and indirect influence that streamers have on this game is fucking stupid. Excuse the language.
Dominus_Dom,"FWIW, I believe you when you say you were not cheating, and rengawr is a tool.

But you posted all this stuff and no actual proof that you weren't cheating. If you were cheating and trying to get unbanned, this post you just made would look no different, no? From his point of view with the (lack of) audio and visual, plus the general state of the game right now, it does seem pretty sus. If the game functioned how it is supposed to most people would say that what happened there was strange. Combined with the fact your ammo can only really kill him with leg shots here, and after doinking his helmet and gzhel you start doinking his legs over and over, I dont blame the guy for suspecting you are cheating, and also, he doesn't change his mind and decide that you aren't cheating like you say he does. It is outrageous that just based on his suspicion and him messaging an admin you can get banned with no actual proof. I hope you get unbanned and completely agree with your point that streamers and sherpas shouldnt have this amount of power. But I think most people here would have a similar reaction..."
Unborkable,Game is run by fucking clowns who only cater to other clowns
bigred1978,"I only started playing about midway through the last wipe and had high hopes.  Watched a bunch of videos and it seemed like the kind of game that was up my alley and fun.

However, as I subbed to this subreddit and read thread after thread about cheaters, bugs, slow, never-ending beta development and now this, it is disappointing. 

I don't have an answer but I would really hope they'd call it quits and just sell the IP and code to a real publisher/developer that could get it done."
TrigoTrihard,Not sure if I would even play after this. Even if my account was unbanned. I wouldn't come back. Fuck the little goblin.
EqulixV2,I’ve seen him do this a few times but normally is very blatant stuff like 9 headshots with pst gzh or floating PMCs. Pretty shitty thing to do to someone when it’s pretty clear what happened after watching the vod
maizelizard,"man, that is royally fucked.

&#x200B;

Tarkov will die soon."
cheeky_scrubzz,"This is why we need a demos system in this game, probably would be super buggy though BECAUSE of all the desync lmao"
SunBrosRus,"That sucks man sorry about that. The opportunity arose and you struck the game is the way it is, built around steamers"
GoTheFuckToBed,shitgame
One_Entrepreneur_181,"Dude I watch this happen live. I did think it was a weird clip but definitely didn't think it was enough evidence to say it was a cheater. 

I can't believe you actually got banned though. If Rengawr has that much power he needs to be more careful"
Kebabs_And_Tits,"The issue is not only with streamers.  


Devs also banned people that killed them in EFT.  
Devs also banned people that just bought the game, in the same second their account was suspended. When such people asked why, support said they did something ""bad"" in the game and all bans are manual issued by operators. Well, this screen proves devs of EFT are liars. Here is the proof: [https://i.imgur.com/O8TVwAO.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/O8TVwAO.jpeg)  
Any discussion about such bans for literally buying the game will be instantly removed from their forums or from Reddit too, probably. They never decided to talk about it and everything about it is censored.  
Some people prove that EFT devs are lying all the time about ""bans issued by OPs"" and that you need to have character in game to be banned. That's proof you can simply buy the game and get banned 1 sec later just because... they want to.

And now they got smashed by Twitch for breaking Terms of Service of this platform."
ArtiChannel,"After all, streamers are god-like personalities, you can't help but please them."
BetFit2122,What a baby
freshlyborn34,I'd probably get banned if I ever kill a streamer since my name is streamsniper but I don't stream snipe I just do it for the lulz
No-Sandwich-729,"WTF, I feel for you OP... 5 days ago on the ""Cheating meta aladdin"" clip on reddit there was a dude in the comments saying that basically wtf that obvious cheater is still playing and not banned, and I responded ""ofc not, OP doesn't have whatsapp contact to BSG""   ... here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1063toi/comment/j3fos0a/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1063toi/comment/j3fos0a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Kinda lowkey hilarious this is the truth we see here. I really feel for you OP and I am sorry.

I have 1000 hours into this game since 2019, and I can't play this wipe on EU because all maps are infested with actual cheaters BSG doesn't wanna solve the issue towards. I quit earlier this week and I will not be back in a while, and I took a year off tarkov previously because of the ACTUAL cheaters and desync.

 I know Zavodskoy is 100% a BSG employee, stop trying to wash this problem out.  
I know you are a BSG employee, give this damn dude his account back. This sub is and the moderation is absolutely peak dogshit, just like the state of this game."
ShearAhr,This is insane if this is true. Getting really out of hand.
