mynamesyow19,"^ REPUBLICANS forced an end to this program. Let's be clear and give credit where credit is due. 


2022: Then the pandemic hit. In 2020, the government took several extraordinary measures to keep Americans financially afloat, from stimulus checks to enhanced unemployment benefits. Included in that were waivers making school lunch free for every K-12 student.

The waivers meant that kids weren't going into school lunch debt, or dealing with the shame of being on free or reduced-price lunch — and that lunch providers could expand what food they were offering to their students.

But Republicans are blocking the renewal of the waivers, spelling a potential end for the program on June 30.

Federal government funding expires on Friday. The full-year spending package, which House Democrats plan to unveil as soon as Tuesday, could allow the waivers to continue for the 2022-23 school year.

>But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is blocking the extension of the waivers, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. So the provision is not in the spending package, as of now.

>Asked about the extension, a GOP leadership aide said that the waivers initially were designated as “temporary” Covid-19 measures and that the Biden administration did not include the extension in its most recent $22.5 billion request for coronavirus-related assistance. Also, many of the waivers are designed to assist when schools are forced to close, which is no longer a focus."

cheysuli,"Posting the story, because this shitty ""journalist"" never mentions it was **Republicans** that killed it, and they don't deserve the clicks:

>As schools around the country reopen after winter break, their students are being reminded of the lunch debt they've racked up this school year – an ugly reality that follows the end of federal assistance that paid for school meals for more than 50 million students during the pandemic. 
Congress ended the free-lunch-for-all program in June, reverting to a system in which low-income families had to fill out paperwork to qualify for aid based on their income. But some families have been left behind because they do not understand the application process, and others are rejected because they do not qualify. A family of four must earn about $36,000 a year or less to qualify for free lunch. 

>Schools often feed these students, requiring them to pay later and creating a debt many families cannot pay down. For some children, the debt can get so big that schools stop giving them a full meal. 
Community organizations, social media influencers and national nonprofits are trying to help fill the void with donations to cover the more than $19 million in debt students have accrued just halfway into the school year. 
It doesn’t seem to be enough: Plenty of kids face going without school lunches or getting smaller, alternative school meals when they return to school this winter because of their negative balances. This is happening at a time of historic inflation, when school meal prices are rising and many families are struggling to pay rent and feed their children. 

>Results from a national survey by the School Nutrition Association, published Wednesday, shows 847 schools had amassed $19.2 million in lunch debt.
Debt varies across the country. Across North Carolina, lunch debt exceeded $1 million as of Nov. 1. One Wisconsin school district surpassed $14,000 in school lunch debt by October. And in Georgia, a nonprofit called All For Lunch paid $130,000 to wipe the debt of several schools across several metro area counties in December. 

>Why does it matter?
>Universal school meals can promote academic achievement, keep kids healthier and reduce ""lunch shaming"" of students who have unpaid meal debt and can't afford their lunch, said Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokeswoman for the national School Nutrition Association. 
According to the national campaign No Kid Hungry, run by the nonprofit Share Our Strength, ""students who eat school breakfast have been shown to achieve 17.5% higher scores on standardized math tests and attend 1.5 more days of school per year"" on average. 

>Who is trying to help?
>Several community groups and even social media influencers are donating to help schools cover students' debt and supporting initiatives that could lead to policy change.
The nonprofit Tusk Philanthropies' Solving Hunger is funding four organizations focused on promoting policy change related to universal free healthy school meals. The organization is funding campaigns in Connecticut, New York, North Carolina and Vermont.
In another, Sarah Stusek recorded herself calling Mount Vernon Community School in a viral TikTok video to pay off the Virginia school’s nearly $1,700 lunch debt. 

>“It’s wonderful (Sarah) is doing that, and that so many community organizations have stepped up to help address this,"" the School Nutrition Association's Pratt-Heavner said. ""But it’s unfortunately a short-term solution and one of the reasons Congress should provide school lunches.”
In recent years, new state legislation has emerged to ban lunch-shaming – preventing schools from feeding kids who can't pay or have with debt smaller alternative meals, thereby broadcasting that they haven't paid up.

>Which states offer free meals to kids?

>Some states opted to continue free-lunch-for-all programs, including Massachusetts, Nevada, Vermont and Pennsylvania.
California, Maine and now Colorado are the only states with laws ensuring permanent universal meal programs for all children, regardless of parents' income. 
A few districts, including in Chicago and New York City, also offer free meals to kids. 
Kids are accruing debt in part because schools are having a hard time getting kids to sign up for the federal free and reduced-price school lunch program. Some children don't qualify but still can't afford meals.
A survey by the National Center for Education Statistics shows student participation in school meal programs is down from last school year by 23% nationally. The largest drop is in the Midwest at 31%.
The October survey shows that of the 88% of schools that operate USDA school lunch and breakfast meal programs, 1 in 4 reported ""it was much more or a little more difficult for their school to operate meal programs"" this school year compared with last.

>Schools told the School Nutrition Association increasing costs, staff shortages, menu item shortages, menu items being discontinued and unpaid meal debt are some of their top challenges. "

ccasey,Plenty of money to feed the MIC
EmDeeAech70,Isn’t that the point? I mean…the poors gotta learn their place as early as possible. What better battleground to start that than school lunches? 🙄🤬🖕🏻

ApolloXLII,“Free” is a naughty word in US politics.
Fat_Lard765,Really wish this would have stayed. It helps a lot of people and kids don’t deserve to be used as political pawns. Whatever happened to just helping people out because it was the right thing to do. It’s so annoying that everything has to have a motive or be tied to something else.  Tax funds should go to free lunches at public schools.
BarryMcCocknerrr,"This will hurt some of the GOP voters own kids, I hope they proud they voted for these guys."
Gurisumonki,"At least all those Californian kids in the thumbnail have food. 

There’s a reason you see more California flag apparel than American flag apparel here…"
meeplewirp,"I can’t imagine knowing that there is a kid that got to eat with everybody else the day before that doesn’t get to eat today, and knowing it was my decision. What kind of worthless dingus can sleep at night after passing this"
RockieK,It's fine as long as it's not an embryo.
fahkoffkunt,Republicans hate children once they’re born.
BelCantoTenor,"We can fund the largest military industrial complex in the world with our tax dollars, but cannot afford to feed children lunch at school. This is bullshit greed."
joe_bald,Fuck this country doing this to kids… take money from the ever-growing budget of the military to fix things for the nation’s citizens.
qtuner,Driving the nail through the concept we’re a Christian nation
Katnamedeaster,"I'm very thankful my district doesn't penalize poor children with starvation. Although those of us who are teachers will usually pick up the tab so a child won't go hungry. Same as we buy snacks and drinks for our classrooms because parents often can't or won't send them in.

This country is ass backwards in so many ways."
StrongChemical,This breaks my heart.
loopie_lou,"Best way to teach kids is to distract them with hunger, right?"
Plane_Safe_1408, Bad title.
jeeaudley,"But.... But... I thought the GOP was the party of ""life""?"
HerringWaffle,The greatest country in the history of the planet 🙄 refuses to ensure its youngest citizens come to a healthy adulthood. Real great country there.
CitizenPain00,"The school I teach at provides free breakfast, free lunch, a snack 6th hour, and free dinner before the students leave and it’s for 100% all students."
biznash,"This cost so little money and did so much good

The cruelty IS the point. Republicans are doing generational damage to their brand with their dumb choices."
PrudentDamage600,It must be the fault of the pagan libertads because Jesus said to care for the poor so the conservatives must have fought hard to keep the program.
pinkandnot,that would have been me in highschool without free school lunches. I WANT my taxes going to feed kids.
chaliemon,This is a crime.  We are in a full dystopian existence

font9a,As long as republicans can stay fat is really all that matters. America first and all that.
Alt-One-More,How do they literally do everything wrong
Torden5410,Reminder that the only way to get pulled up by your bootstraps is with assistance. You can't simply pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
opalll,"This is really upsetting. I can remember back in high school when I had a job, I used my money to pay for my other siblings lunches because we were poor.."
CableVannotFBI,"If someone is forced to be somewhere for 7-9 hours a day, meals should be provided. 

And yes, I include students, the workforce (public & private) and anyone with this requirement."
Destinlegends,This is just evil.
Pretty_Advantage_700,Heartbreaking! As a teacher who retired this year one memory I have of a former student who was being picked up early by the parent was asking to go to the lunchroom before leaving to pick up their lunch to eat at home. They needed it.
lensman3a, Colorado in the last election passed a law that anybody making over about $300k will be taxed extra for paying for school lunches.
kdubsonfire,And what do hungry children do?  Lie cheat and steal to survive.  Wowwww.  The amount of shooting yourself in the foot that comes from the right is absurd.  Logic is not present.
sonoma4life,"go to school get education and lunch? Bad  
  
go to military, get education, lunch, and salary? Good"
SlinkyTail,"I survived on free school lunches, typically that's what I had for the whole day!  ~~what is wrong with these people~~  oh that's right, old and hateful and out of touch and it hurts their poor wittle wallets."
iskyoork,Is getting older becoming more and more disappointed with your country?
,"Yes, but everybody in congress has access to food, so why in the fuck would they care?"
That_Storage_9614,"OK first they got to stop this misinformation Remember the house is only 1/2 of 1/3 of the government you have the executive branch the legislative branch and the judicial branch? the Senate hasn’t pass  anything and the executive isn’t going to sign it  then it ain’t happening yet, Captain"
POOP-Naked,"Last years school district taxes: $4800. No free lunch program. Asked at the school board meeting why. 

“It’s up to parents to take care of their children”

Ok then, we don’t have kids but would like to sponsor a lunch program and raise funds with other area businesses. 

“No you can’t do that” 

Area businesses proceed to offer free meals to kids all year anytime. School district : we need to raise takes for the free lunch program to be reinstated."
Mace_Du,"I specifically remember a Republican congressman saying the reason they didn't believe in this program was because it ""spoils"" kids. Yeah...free food for impoverished kids really ruins things, helping them stay alive and all."
bluenami2018,*Republican Congress
Jp8istasty,Why do Republicans want hungry children?
nicholasgnames,Hope they eat the voters who eliminated it
spicy_sauceman_,"Bring back the Black Panthers Party for the love of god! 

They’re the only ones who gave a shit about kids 😤"
hangryandanxious,"If you haven’t started already, time to start dressing down your local Republicans for voting these fucks into office."
Mall3usMaleficarum,This country has a fetus fetish. We could give a shit about kids once they are born.
SeraphsBlade,This is shameful school lunches should be provided for everyone.
BoosterRead78,GOP: “stop giving handouts they can feed themselves.”
jkuhl,Why is it such a fight to provide lunch to public school students?  I don't get it.
scooby_doo_shaggy,"I'm a senior in high school, my lunches cost 2.80 a day for 5 days a week. If I can't get to school on time and get a free breakfast (typically consisting of a pastry and a milk, so about 400 calories) I go hungry the entire day and have nothing to eat at lunch. Almost every school day of 7:40AM-2:40PM, I find it hard to concentrate on work due to a combination of ADHD, Autism, and hunger."
B0b_a_feet,$850 billion for defense spending and no money for hungry children. We should all be ashamed.
-Dillad-,it’s depressing that people at my school are so deep in lunch debt that we joke about it and compare amounts
ThatWhiteKid08,Man republicans REALLY want school kids to die. Whether it’s starving or getting shot.
leeny1018,How Christian of them
smokeeater150,Weren’t school lunches commonplace back when America was originally great?
the-hottest-of-damns,"Erm, “Congress” in this title means Republicans, thanks."
Jay_Dub_daddy,Free market win! /s
HumpSlackWails,"Reminder:  


Red states make up 8/10 of our most DC-dollar dependent states while - nationwide - revenues flow OUT from cities to rural areas.  


Right-wing taker hypocrisy is mind boggling."
favnh2011,We should be funding this.
AmadeusK482,"Why is the phrase ""school lunch debt"" even in our vocabulary as Americans?"
Obizues,Who wants to to bet Congress is still spending millions on their food without a hint of irony?
ninthtale,">A family of four must earn about $36,000 a year or less to qualify for free lunch.

Elibrius,There’s literally 0 good reasons to restrict lunch for kids. None
Historical-Map7788,They are dismantling every program the people who elected them require to survive
Evanje53,Another reason it's terrible to be a teacher.
Longjumping-Most-320,"Sadly, in our school, the end of the subsidy means lower quality food as the school tries to keep it affordable"
BostonSamurai,PrO LiFe!
default-0985,I legit cannot think of anything more evil. Kids did not choose to be born. It is not their fault if their parent can provide for them or not. Getting breakfast and lunch Monday through Friday during the school year is literally the bare minimum we can do as a country. This is insane
nucumber,FUN FACT:  the school lunch program was started shortly after WWII because so many military draftees were ineligible to serve due to malnutrition and malnutrition related issues.
drearylanemuffin,"GOP - Not giving handouts unless you can afford them. Also, unborn children have rights. Born children, not so much."
Emergency-Salamander,Republicans
GhostChainSmoker,"Those stupid fuck heads! Kids going hungry is one of those things that makes me genuinely angry. You force them to be there all day, but you can’t provide them food? 

You take away the rights to abortion and try to block contraceptives so the poor people you hate so much have even more kids they can’t provide for and more kids who did nothing wrong other than be born suffer.

Those lunches were some of the only food these kids got!

We’ve got all the fuckin money in the world to throw at Israel and the military industrial complex. But kid? Our future? Nah nah fuck them!"
Mxysptlik,"Of course they did.

Sometimes the one sure meal a day some kids get!"
MalumOptimatium,Conservatives aren't happy unless they are causing suffering.
4alittleRnR_2057,"This is the absolute proof that Republicans have zero empathy for anyone; not even hungry children....except for an unborn fetus, of course. I'd like to see them go without food for just one day."
iRadinVerse,The child tax credit that was introduced early during the covid-19 pandemic cut childhood poverty in America in half. And we stopped doing it because?
lovehearts127,"I'm so terrified of how the GOP asshats keep going and going and going and they STILL have so much support. Openly racist and hateful to anyone other than a white Christian male. They force unwanted pregnancies upon women and LITTLE GIRLS. They then refuse to provide ANYTHING for these unwanted babies. if they even make it to adulthood without being slaughtered in their school, climate change caused by the fossil fuels they love to profit off of will quite possibly irreversibly destroy the Earth by the time I'm 35.

I don't even know if I want to live to be 35 anymore. I'm sure this is what ""God"" wanted. for all creation to suffer."
operationtasty,They’ve shown they want public school kids to die w school shootings. Why is this surprising
PlaidDad146,"Imagine being the type of person upset about their tax dollars feeding children, while also not being the person upset about their tax dollars feeding billionaires."
JadedIdealist,Punishing the innocent (in this case children) to hurt others (in this case adult carers) is textbook evil in my book.
gravywayne,Revoke benefits for representatives
TikiTacos_,It really sounds like our government just doesn’t have enough money? Maybe we should increase the corporate tax rate that Donald cut 12%
fomites4sale,Most of the heartless shitstains who voted for this haven’t gone hungry a day in their lives.
EffieDrinksTea,USA is its own greatest enemy.
JohnnyGFX,"Republicans... Republicans in congress blocked a free lunch for all program.

**Republicans.**"
Prestigious_End_1385,Sadistic assholes. I hope if hell is real they’ll suffer all the things they do to people 10 fold
Ill-Organization-719,The cruelty is the point. The thought of low income children suffering is exciting to them. This is why they do it.
Azer1287,"So the super rich people and corporations can pay no taxes, but we can’t afford meals for our students?  Explain to me how that isn’t screwed up."
Zealousideal_Sea_527,"Republican majority got rid of....
Fixed that headline for you."
RedGenie87,"As a parent of 3, this seriously pisses me off. The quality of the food has gone down since we started paying again. It’s such bullshit"
englishcrumpit,Do congress get free lunch?
voyagertoo,Wtf is wrong with you all smdh
stompintwigs,We the tax payers pay for these fat lazy slobs free food while they are working and they do less work then fucking school children.

Now about our future workforce..."
AnxietyTsunami,"I’m sure all the rural, poor republican voters in Kentucky and Texas and Alabama will blame commie, ultra super lib, radical leftists when their kids stop getting lunches"
AnonAmbientLight,Republicans literally swiping the food out of hungry kid’s mouths.
Interesting_Reach_29, Congress didn’t. GOP Congress did.
Jelqing_for_Jesus,It's embarrassing to be an American at this point.
