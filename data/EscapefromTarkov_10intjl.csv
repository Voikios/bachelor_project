chiaros,Back in the day we used to fall into holes like this and keep running for rhe entire raid for ludicrous strength xp
Annonimbus,"Congratulations, you escaped Tarkov"
DocTooDope,Not gonna lie I was hoping for the survived screen at the end.
TheGreatWalk,"Too bad you can't abuse it for max str, endurance, covert stealth, and health anymore.

Those were the days."
HelloJapan,"Oh so that's what happened to me here. I just chalked it up to lag.

KaiZeeYT,"How are you getting 90+ fps on streets?? This wipe my pc cant even handle the main menu and if the servers allow me to enter streets i get max 15 frames, no gunshot audio and of course the usual rubberbanding."
Jeolmangx,ive fallen through the ground three times while i was rubberbanding this wipe and when i see that color now i immediately take my hands off the wheel
Ren11234,"Streets is such a sick map, very impressed with it I can't wait to see how they expand on it."
chaken193,Fell through this 10 minutes into wipe on our first streets raid. Definitely set the mood for the wipe lol
Sad__Kirby,It's platform  9 3/4
No_Grocery_9757,I scav streets and have been guiding people into the wall and making funny clips outta it lol
krys_krog,"There was about 7 videos about this, its not secret"
KOB0LT,The only way to escape Tarkov is to venture into the back rooms.
aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,:| but the map and design team is all we really have to praise.
cetineru,"The fact that they still didn't fix this shit worries me so much about the future of this game. It has been weeks bro like, put a fucking box or metal sheet or something there even if fixing the issue with the collision is not that easy."
Keysarr,So sloppy to forget to add collisions there lmao
murrkpls,"BSG is so incompetent that it's stopped being annoying and looped around to being funny. I can't believe there's actually people that take this broken piece of shit seriously and grind it every wipe. I'll give streamers a pass, since they somehow get money for it. The rest of you are 100% confirmed braindead, though."
Kaieron,"""secret"""
AdNew6926,"we know, we all know this has been reposted so many times"
MattyB-02,What is that overlay he is using for temps and fps??
biglygreens,"Yep, died just like you did today XD Fortunately all my gear was insured"
MathematicianNext345,It's extract right to Archangels gate?
rootedoak,"There was a full loot mmo that I played, and there was a glitch in a wall like this. You could just jump in the hole if you heard someone coming and save all your loot. RMT farmers eventually took over the area lol."
Doogie-Howser,"The raider suddenly opens his eyes to find himself in the back of a horse cart with other individuals. 

""Hey it's you...you're finally awake."""
TopCheddar27,Ive fallen into this recently. Have video proof.
Wellmybad,Ah yes new hole to drop backpacks
MusicAndMunchys,My dumb ass really thought you were gonna extract when you started to fall ðŸ˜‚
DashingDangerously,"Finally, a way to escape tarkov"
IrregularrAF,"the way he was shooting randomly was reminding me of those stupid videos where people say ""this is how you unlock the raygun in cod multiplayer"" ðŸ¤£"
eithrusor678,My friend did the exact same thing a few days ago
AetherBytes,THATS WHERE THAT FUCKING SCAV WENT
chuckdankst,So it's still a thing?
Penziplays,Can't wait for the streets hogwarts expansion
MrPoppaCap,Fell through the map in that location a few days ago
Jakebasswatson,"Oh shit we speed running tarkov?  


*new tech just dropped*"
whale-trees,Backrooms Extract
DisguisedHorse222,"It's because they literally forgot to put a collider there. Or rather the stairs don't extend the mesh to that section (see pics) This isn't a nuanced issue with exact angles causing a glitch, they just modelled the building poorly

The corridor for reference

The Collider geometry BSG uses for collision (obviously)

Extract with highlighted stairs section which for some reason they call ""indoor ladder walls"" because ESL is a thing I guess

Colour coded each piece of geometry for people to see it easier.

Lannister2280,I just found a ledx in the barrel near an exit on Interchange as a scav. It's price pleasantly surprised me :)
Iteroparous,Skill issue
nukoservioss,"It's not secret, it's already been posted on here."
SPO0KY_MULDER_,Same here
PureRushPwneD,hahaha nice
dlp2828,That's just platform 9 and 3 quarters
gnashered,No loot or gear extract
Ollemeister_,"""How to escape Tarkov with this one neat trick"""
akaBrucee,"Ah yes, the classic Combat Arms run into the edge of a wall glitch if anyone remembers that."
DuckInCup,This clip reminded me to use RTSS instead of the ingame overlay. Thanks boss.
HazeusView47,"Dude, this happened to me 3rd day of wipe, i found a usb and laughed at my friends, after that run against that wall and fell down..."
iam_mr_meeseeks,Oh thank God. I thought I was the only person whom this void claimed. I back into it while in the middle of a firefight.
