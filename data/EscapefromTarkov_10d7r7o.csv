Nedgeh,As someone who used to play Siege I always chuckle a bit when people reference Operation Health considering it didn't really fix anything and actually just revealed that Ubisoft lied about how well their servers were running.
whogivesafuck4321,".. but we added 2 more shotguns, 10 ammo types and 5 new useless variants of rigs to the game! pls come back!"
thermostato42,"The game is in such a bad state right now that i've dropped it after 2300 hours.

Desync is worse than ever and audio it's completely messed up. Literally the two key things to make this game playable are absolutely broken. 

If you feel frustrated by playing the game, just don't go ahead playing it and wait for the next wipe, hoping something gets fixed."
gudzgudz,"Klean is absolutely delusional saying everyone's wrong and tarkov is in it's best state this wipe....

\- Cheating situation is horrible, despite all the measures taken that only hurt the player base's quality of life

\- Sounds in their worst state

\- Optimisations non-existent - despite ppl begging for optimisations, they release more content/map that runs horribly both in terms of FPS and server performance

\- Terrible memory leaks again

\- Bugs/stability - BSG brings in more new bugs than they fix.. as well as reverting/bringing back previously fixed issues again....as Lirik said: ""monkey-ass devs""

\- Comms have become non-existent.... silent updates/changes, removing Christmas tree in the middle of the day with no warning.

People have been asking for Operation Health for years already, as well as important features like loadout presets and other QOL changes, loot balancing........ only to be completely ignored and get more unoptimized content.. or a useless gym that you need to build so you don't have debuffs....

BSG really needs 1) to be in touch with the players and 2) an actual game designer"
StealthCatUK,"Still dieing routinely to sound issues, in customs people walking around upstairs sounds as if they are on exactly the same floor as me (ground). Dieing to incorrect sound queues pisses me off. It's why I play Woods cause you dont have to deal with shit sound direction as much."
DeQuan7291,"I haven't played Tarkov near its release, the earliest was probably either 2019 or 2020 and I don't remember much. I'm sure desync has gotten better since release to an extent.

However, what I don't understand is how could someone think that a game is good to go from alpha to beta with desync present. I don't even think Contract Wars or Hired Ops had as much desync as this game."
Pleasant-Chemical-71,"the quality of the game is bad very bad optimization

all wipes are the same.

Game audio is broken

Gun lights go through the walls it's a mess"
niceBobJobShowVagene,"I really wish this game had competition too, would be the best thing to ever happen to Tarkov."
Just_Session_3847,"I'd honestly be fine with them pulling a DayZ Standalone and just shutting the game down for like a year and gutting all their tech debt and rebuilding, removing all the issues that are plaguing them. It's only going to help them in the future. Refresh the game and bring back some hype when it's eventually re-releases. At the moment the majority of the playerbase is burn't out and won't admit it and having to deal with the same shit bugs for years.

They could even look at re-writing their client server code and getting unity to actually help make a threadhandler that can ultilise more than one bloody core. The game would bounce back better and stronger than ever.

&#x200B;

And before someone says ""What about the streamers"", fuck the streamers. I like some of the tarkov guys but they'd need to adapt. The games potential is massive and BSG are currently in a hole they can't climb out of. It's time to just go behind closed doors and work on something in peace."
MOR187,I'm pretty sure that nobody would complain about lacking content on a major patch / wipe if they fix audio and desync. I still don't understand why they released streets or weapons.. I still don't understand why they even released light house with a broken game and broken core mechanics.. wrong priorities imo
Seenot77,sneaking is literally broken and they don't even fix that core mechanic. Game is dead.
dbvbtm,"BSG got the bag, they do not give a shit."
PugstaBoi,"I’m relatively new. This is my second wipe and  I am really starting to feel and understand the tragedy of how this game just cant seem to fix so many long-standing issues and just continues to turn seasoned players away. It seems like most people really only get three wipes worth of fun before the constant unfixed issues (performance, slow content addition, cheaters etc.) turns the game stale and unplayable.

My controversial opinions are that if they added a 2 factor authentication with a phone number, it would largely fix the banned cheater problem. 

If they could somehow allocate more funding toward the performance and content improvement, it could also help. I think a sad truth about the best games nowadays, is that without micro transactions or a monthly subscription, there is just a limitation in the amount of funding to keep a large team of devs pumping out a great game. 

The game loop for this game is unmatched, and so many players are able to shrug some of the issues off for a limited period of time. But in the end, it always becomes stale and unplayable when problems just seem to repeat every wipe."
Majorllama66,"6k hours and I walked away from the game before this latest wipe. Love the game. Got my moneys worth (and then some), but I'm not putting any more time into a game that isn't actually improving. Audio is still shit. They keep taking things away from normal people to ""stop cheaters"". 

Nakita and his team at BSG have created something beautiful but flawed. 

This game never should have been built in unity. 
They need to have any amount of consistent communication with their customers. 
Patch notes are rare and often don't actually include all the changes. They don't follow through with half the things they promise. 

I hope one day they can execute everything they dreamed of and make the game we all hope it can be, but I am not holding my breath."
SigmaMale101,Next wipe is going to need Operation Resuscitate.
Mangustii,Memory leak all day long
Samwise_the_Tall,"Yeah I hate to tell you but I tapped out this wipe. It's all too much. My breaking point was having two consecutive deaths from scope ADS lag. How can I compete in a game when everytime I use a scope I get frame dips down to 15-30 fps?? This on top of all the other problems, which at this point is just too long a list to list again in another post. It's honestly just sad, they had a product they can't get to run right and cheaters are everywhere. And on top of it all they don't even talk to the community. A big fucking middle finger."
Dont_Be_Mad_Please,"The start of this wipe was like being hit by a truck of problems. I LOVED the end of wipe last wipe, it was smooth as butter, the AI wasn't literally broken and the audio was reliable albeit a little bad. But all that turned on its head the second the wipe dropped and it has never felt worse in the 3 wipes I've participated in.

Immediately every aspect of the game was on fire and I was having significantly less fun than the last wipe. Not even just in terms of the core gameplay loop, progression felt worse too. I don't know if that's just me, but I had a lot of fun last wipe questing and grinding, but the scav changes made the start of this wipe so frustrating it has tainted my perception of the wipe going forward.

Scav's are fixed as well as a lot of the other 'on release' issues, but  to me the damage is done. Something continues to feel wrong and I am not enjoying this wipe even half as much as other wipes; and I'm finding it hard to want to come back.
$0.02"
OpportunityNo1318,"I fully agree and been only playing for 1 year now. 
Yet, they probably will release just another 9x18mm ammo type. Or another shotgun variant. Or another shit map that runs shit. Or increase desync. Or fuck up the audio even more. And so on and on…

For whoever gets frustrated about the game, only 1 advice: stop playing and advice anybody asking you if they should buy it, to say no. 

If feedback from the community isn’t being taken seriously then we need to vote with our wallet."
nuttz0r,Wipes without new content are almost universally slammed by the majority and end up dead after a month or two.
SxyBud,Try to switch that one beige Scope from 1x to 8x... shits taking longer to click than me to eat a Cheesburger
No-Phase2131,"Yes, performance and sound should be the focus now"
00000000000000000099,"Dude, even if there was competition it wouldn't make BSG any good at programming games. 

It's amazing this thing works at all with how obviously unskilled these hacks are."
RJohn12,sound really fucka me off here
SuperRektT,They cant fix it and they dont care so it doesnt need anything. They will just do someshit in 6 months for next wipe and thats it. nEw CoNtEnT bY nikIta and some words to hype for fanboys in some podcast
Justaguyhilol,"Yeah. It does.

Fix recoil, fix audio, fix lighting, fix your fixes because it's BSG and we know they'll fuck something up along the way, fix AI, fix global stock limits existing, fix limiting the flea market like lol, fix FIR status by deleting it, repeat fixing your fixes because it's BSG, and... We might be getting somewhere."
Electrical-Wedding87,"i was having fun this wipe despite issues, but the audio is so bad this wipe i eventually couldn't take it anymore and quit. hope they fix it soon"
SubjectToReview,"Most of my gear loss this wipe has been caused by disconnects, crashes and other stability issues. I know I suck at the game but at least let me die to a scav or PMC and not a tech issue."
rea557,"The one thing that really pisses me off is how bad the main menu can chug. I don’t know anything about game development but I’m a web dev a know you run a simple html web app for menus in unity. 

So why the fuck can it take minutes to load back into the menu after a raid. Even if their dbs are shit and completely overloaded your stash and load out is already downloaded onto your computer from after your raid. Just load the fucking screen and let me interact with it. Any web dev worth anything knows how to do this and I cannot for the life of me figure out why loading the menu can take so long. 

I get in a raid the server needs to be the source of truth to keep everything in sync but you can easily use optimistic updates in the menu screen to make it feel snappy when using it while behind the scene the client is waiting for the server response without the user noticing at all."
sicknander,"When people say desync, does that mean players experience things happening in the server at slightly different times? Is that why it sometimes feels like people shoot me the INSTANT i come into their view, even if they shouldn’t have known I was there? Or am I just that bad hahah"
Chadgiggs,"Except operation heath did FUCK ALL for anything, the Ubisoft devs literally enjoyed a seasons long vacation and nothing changed for the better. BSG does not deserve a vacation or credit for shit."
Rezhyn,"> Nobody will care about new content updates if none of it works...

This is why every winter update with a new map has record players? You're not getting an operation health, it doesn't make money and sell copies. Stop with the daily posts on it."
VALORBANTS,Isnt it pretty much always like this when they release a new map? As someone whos hit 1k hours and quit when all we had were paca and fort armor but has been following development this is par for the course. Just like these threads.
No_Interaction_4925,"For your frame issues and stuttering, turn off ‘Binaural Audio”"
imdcrazy1,"Bro, do a search by ""Operation Health"" on this sub, just to get a feel on how pointless your post is."
shittyrivets,Im playing fucking atlas over tarkov because of this shit
R0ZV0,Restart the game after 2-3 raids. it helps little bit
The_Juzzo,Thats me in the garage thinking the chad in Techlight is right around the corner preparing to push me.
IXCenturion,every single streets raid i play has been stutter hell. I’m not playing that map anymore no matter how many times my buddies ask. its so bad
Whole_Ad5154,Operation “slujeewee”
_baundiesel_,Siege got that because it was the financial backbone for a AAA publisher with long term aspirations. EFT is not in that situation. Nikita will move on as soon as he's able.
xRageNugget,At least youcan olay the game. I get constant server connection loss since the hotfix. Literally unplayable. Don't even get into a match anymore
SanduskySleepover,"So true, waited a few years for Streets of Tarkov and I have played it a whole 2 times this wipe… I’m staying longer because of the changes to mid wipe for sure but the main reason I didn’t take a break this wipe to check out streets and we can’t even play it."
Mind-TheGap,"They felt like they had to get Streets out before year end so they pushed it to ""get it done"". IMO BSG needs to spend a little less money placing random objects around (which I agree look amazing and add to the attention to detail, but can easily be added later) and start working on servers and audio. The game is unbearable to play in it's current state unless you just run Customs."
guthixgork,I really dislike the extended black screen after the end of a raid. That's starting to grind my gears.
Xantaraxy0,The hideout delay sounds like a you issue
praisedtimon,"They won't do it. They will milk this game, slap 1.0 when sale plummet and move on."
Kyle700,i think its funny that people think bsg basically hasnt already been doing this for the past year.  theres been like one major patch the whole of last year and it was on the last day of the year lol.  the problem is the game is not fixable
Jannies_are_whores,LOL Battlestate is incompetent.
rodigo1,Not gonna happen
BukLauFinancial,"lol, if I had a dollar for every ""operation health"" suggestion post on this sub I'd be a rich man"
Big-Cheeese,Operation Health hurt siege more than it helped it
TrumpieDumpie,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. I played R6 during Operation Health and it was hell on earth. Server had never been that bad!
hiddenintheleavess,"bsg both dont care and don't have the ability to do so.  

sorry"
magooballs,To fix the memory leaks and clear your clogged up ram just restart your game after a raid or two.  Not a big deal bud.
DilWig,"hey look its only the 10th wipe this had been asked for :o

I bought this game in 2018, this shit has been a topic since then.

copium from you people is hardcore, the devs have shown their intent if you don't like stop feeding it."
SlumberFumble,"Can I ask what your computer specs are OP? I play in a large group and only the peeps with very low end hardware are seeing constant stutters, I have a good rig and only see issues in streets, which is expected at this point to be honest"
DabScience,"I want to play Streets so bad. But the few times I have it's just been a dreadful experience. When I do load in, its terrible FPS, rubber banding, packet loss, desync. Getting shot by/dying to scavs when literally no one is around. Have multiple recorded instances of this. 

This wipe is the worst I've seen in my 4 years of playing this game. I'm usually having so much fun playing this game at this point. But between the lighting issues, MAJOR sound issues, ammo changes, gun recoil, hackers, desync, and just overall shit optimization... Fuck man this might be my last wipe for awhile. 

Also love how you can't drop weapon piece for Gunsmith quests to your friends, but you CAN drop the entire gun already built for them. EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THAT IS PREVENTING RMT???? Does BSG have one working brain at the company?"
whiteteepoison2,Just be smart like me and upgrade to 32gb of ram in order to run the game without stutters! 🥴
omegapenta,"to ppl complaining about streets running like shit when reserve came out wasn't it more of the same?


i do hate the switch from steam audio tho."
Scooter_S_Dandy,"I made a post with this sentiment last wipe and brought up all the issues that are being brought up here, all I did was get flamed by people lulling over how bad operation health was for siege. We have the same thing happening here now, except this wipe is significantly worse.

All of my friends have jumped ship, I've jumped ship, I don't really care what BSG nut huggers have to say, this game needs some support like a year ago, because this game is quickly turning to shit.

Just an idea, if you like the game and care about the development, quit blowing smoke up new players asses and stop praising BSG for bare minimum work, and just say the game needs health patches.

Tarkov won't be installed on my PC again until they fix the existing issues and add quality of life improvements because this game seriously isn't fun in its current state"
Sneaky_Rhin0,if anything what we need is a valve spring cleaning.
ApeOfDiamondz,"Literally only just seen operator Drewskis video on tarkov. He’s one of a handful of YouTubers, who have actually put out a video, saying this is the worst wipe ever, and criticising the game. 

Every other YouTuber has said the optimisation is getting better, and it will be fixed soon."
LightningBlehz,I’ve been thinking this the whole time but didn’t want to say it just because Operation Health was kind of a dumpster fire for a year and a half.
Didki_,"As someone else pointed out, Health was a bandaid, they took 3 months to fix some bugs and glitches, then more popped up even in the same style as the ones ""fixed"" because their core design decision making never changed.  


It's like a diet, what is 3 months of a good diet and exercise  going to accomplish when after it's over you'll be going back to a sedimentary lifestyle and junkfood?  


The same thing can be applied to BSG and Tarkov, they don't consider repercussions, they don't test, they don't listen and take ages to fix anything because they are always caught by surprise. BSG and Ubisoft in a nutshell."
MolotovFromHell,I literally couldn't care less about streets because there are so many issues. I would happy if they stopped working on any new content for 6-12 months and just works on fixed and QoL. That would get me more excited than any new map.
fifthg3n,Every other day we get a post like this. Every wipe it doesn't change.
Chris_Cobi,"I love it all, just wish this game would crash and burn. Dont get me wrong, BSG came out with a great idea but fuck their ""we will do what the fuck we want with our game"" mentality aka ""fuck listening to the fan base, we'll give them a pacifier by pretending to listen to the things they get up in arms in like the Rengarr thing"". Worse part is people still eat it all up all this shit up"
stuckonthecrux,"De-sync is worse than ever, connection issues are worse than ever, Asia servers are plagued with more cheaters than I've ever ran into. I got 6 PMC raids deep this wipe and I just can't put myself through the punishment anymore. It was ""janky"" in a charming way when I started playing 6-7 wipes ago, now it's just borderline unplayable. I'll watch people playing Streets and get the craving to jump on, but when I do it's just tread-milling, de-sync, hackers, and disconnects. The connection issues are just the tip of the iceberg but I can at least tolerate the other issues."
MaxPayne-7,"Does OP even what even happened during ""Operation Health"", it's simple and it sounded like they were fixing all the stuff during that time, but they weren't, instead the whole game went through a chaotic updates that renders the game more unplayable, and at the end the whole ""Operation Health"" thing ended up as a joke (literally, if you open youtube most of the stuff are just memes that mocks the namesake of the patch)"
crpiecho,Operation health- lock all of the great ammo behind 130 pointless therapist quests
PharmAttack,"The stutter when loading screens has always been a thing. And in pretty sure will always be a thing due to loading. 

They really should add a delay or something between the click sound and the transition. I think that'd fix it haha"
CeoOfLighthouse,"This wipe should not have happened. It should have happened in March or April when it would most likely have actually been ready and optimized. I agree. Operation Health would be great. But transparency leading up to this wipe and the problems we will experience would have been better than what happened. Imagine if we all got an honest warning of what the wipe would be like. 

I feel like that alone would bring down a lot of the anger and controversy."

ravenousglory,"R5 5600X, 3070 and 16gbs of 3600CL14 RAM here. played a whole weekend without such issues. The problems appeared on newer maps on old PC with 8 gigs of RAM, Reserve and Lighthouse were almost unplayable, other maps worked better. Now my only concern is framerate, which was pretty good at start of the wipe but seems like now I have a bit lower on average. Other games run the same. Check your hardware."
BigShrekDaddy69,"THAT'S NOT THE GAME LMAO THATS UR TRASH PC

p4nnus,"Anyone who thinks that EFT needs ""Operation Health"" should see what Nikita and that senior unity dev that did an AMA here two weeks a go have said about the spaghetti code of EFT."
KevinsLunchbox,"I'm okay with Audio but only because it's so shit for everyone that I somewhat feel safe because not even the super Chad's can pinpoint my location. 

I was doing Bunker part 2 and a player scav blacked my chest but because of the audio and the fact that the buildings on Reserve are like 6 stories, even more with the bunker, the 5 or so players around me who could hear me coughing couldn't actually find me. I was able to run out of Black Pawn, sprint to White Pawn and get that door and extract at sewer with Bunker part 2 finished all while the entire time coughing. 

So for now. I'm neutral about the shit audio. It's benefitted me a little. Still trash tho"
Usual_Photograph_983,Also cut out the tumors cancer known as a certain privileged streamer flexing the to hard!

MatrixBunny,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/wgp2un/bsg\_need\_a\_major\_health\_patch/
ShadowZpeak,Tarkov could use the R6 treatment where they recoded everything from scratch to fix all those bugs that came from patching patches on patches.
Stonie_Plays,Ya that didn't go very well for ubisoft so idk what's gonna be different here
Jackal_Oddie,"Now forgive and correct me if I’m wrong, didn’t OP-H in siege bring about a new wave of cheaters?"
Faesarn,"Nobody will care about new content updates if none of it works... 100%.

Streets is a fantastic map that half my friends can't load or have less than 40fps... the other half won't play it because we usually spend 10 minutes waiting for the servers to stop rubberbanding... 

If the game brings nothing new until 2024 but we get a working audio, better recoil and better fps on Streets and Lighthouse I would be more than happy."
Alterragen,Memory leaks are not a new thing in tarkov I have had to restart the game every few raids or so since I bought tarkov. As for the sound issue I totally agree. I’m glad you can hear people on other levels but it is a bit much. However this wipe I have been killed over a dozen times by people who literally make no sound. I would have preferred QoL fixes over the streets of tarkov but that’s not going to happen.
Chud2212,"I'm still absolutely shocked that considering it's popularity no AAA studio has even come close to making something like this. But to be fair they'd probably want to add fucking battle passes and an  in game store to it, seems there not interested unless they can do that anymore sadly."
Newguyiswinning_,This game is fucked. Not even close to release and already needs a health patch
Splitdifferences,I would be totally okay with absolutely no new content until they optimize the game. 100% would be worth.
jabralta,"Guess what people will still play, even bought a ""nioce"" (after the lip smack sound) laptop to play on the road in my sleeper berth, so you chumps cant out level me. Supply and demand, you cant get this kind of hit anywhere else. Its cool find the new items added to the game, new muzzle suppressor combos, new mounting systems, new armor. 5.45 is new meta, its been my meta since i started last wipe. Give BSG a break, they gave me a reason to get back into pc gaming, giving me great entertainment while in the midst of wartime. Ungrateful, entitled, lobby fodder."
