8to24,"Trump's campaign manager, financial manager, personal lawyer, and National Security Advisor were all prosecuted for felons in association with Trump's 2016 campaign. During the primaries Cruz, Graham, and Rubio all repeatedly called Trump a conman. Yet today the whole Republican party kneels before MAGA. 

It should surprise no one that Jr Republicans learned from Trump's example."

BabyMFBear,"Well, GOP, you opened the fucking flood gates for this shit and now we all suffer for it. Fucking assholes."
shed1,Does Ryan have a book to sell or is he getting ready to run for something?
409024072546630,It looks like Koch has activated Paul Ryan for a presidential run.
Prismane_62,"From what Ive read, Republicans wont let him resign because he actually won a Dem favored area. So to resign would mean a reelection & possibly losing the seat, which the Republicans can’t afford given their very small margin in the House. So it seems they will tolerate a bonafide fraud rather than risk a seat."
BlotchComics,"I can pretty much guarantee that Paul Ryan would be defending Santos, just like McCarthy, if he was still Speaker.

The republican majority is slim as is and he wouldn't risk giving a seat back to the dems."
ryebrye,"Paul Ryan famously made up marathon PRs, so he knows a thing or two about embellishing."
AlertThinker,I've said it before and I'll say it again: Where did Santos get $750K? Who is funding him? I think it's a foreign government. He's a plant to do the bidding of a foreign government. He's a fraud and a traitor. He should be investigated for national security risks.
dauerad,"While no laws may have actually been broken by any of his alleged lies, this should be the catalyst for new legislation then that does make it illegal."
splycedaddy,"Always former, never current. Repubs need the vote even if it comes from the devil himsef"
BrownEggs93,Oh paul!  You laid the groundwork for him!  You and the rest of the GOP aided the rise of assholes like him and embraced the voters that put him there!  You all created this guy.
SenorBurns,"It's sad when Republicans who used to represent the ultimate of Republican scumbaggery, like Paul Ryan, are now the principled voices of ethics and reason in comparison to the current crop."
Epicassion,Retired or retiring GOP politician calling out the dregs of the GOP. This should come from current leadership to address and sadly will not happen.
hour_of_the_rat,"For the few GOP calling on Santos to resign, it's performance theater--he won't do it, McCarthy keeps his vote, and they look good for calling on Santos to resign. ""We asked him to resign, what more do you want from us?""

It's not a serious ask unless Ryan, the few NY GOP US House members, and some from the NY State GOP delegation call for the US House to have a vote to expel Santos as a member--which would take 2/3 of the membership."
Anotherusername777,A fraudulent candidacy born of a fraudulent leader born of a fraudulent political movement. Yup. It all checks out. He’s not exceptional; he’s representative of the natural direction of Ryan and his ilk. He’s all yours buddy. You and YOUR entire movements fraudulence. Enjoy.
Mr_Ballyhoo,"Remember when Al Franken resigned over a photograph.  I do.  This seems like a way bigger deal than a photograph of a guy hovering his hands over a woman's breasts(yeah it's sleazy, and he rightfully removed himself).  This dude is an an outright fraud and should be removed."
weezer-hash-pipe,"Paul Ryan is hardly one to be criticizing someone for being fraudulent.

Ryan is the poster child for being a partisan hack.

He literally went straight from college to being a congressional aide, to being a congressman, to suddenly controlling the budget of the most powerful country in the world.

He literally had zero work experience running anything of size, while determining its budget, operations, etc.

He was a waiter and he drove the Oscar Meyer weiner mobile. That's it."
was_and_wasnt,Mr Ryan seems to be making the case put forward by the majority of Americans.  From Trump is a loser to Santos is a fraud.  Amazing.  Amazing that once out of office Mr Ryan finds his spine.  He endorsed Trump in 2016.  Then enthusiastically ran cover for Trump after he was elected.  He apparently did all that without a spine......
muffledvoice,Yet many of the people on r/conservative are saying he shouldn’t resign because they need his vote to push their regressive agenda and “the Dems do the same thing.”  Astounding display of cynicism and selfishness.
Moctezuma1,"It's frustrating how rules don't apply to politicians.


 If I apply for a high paying job and get hired based on my qualifications....then found out I lied about it all...I would be fired on the spot. 


Where else can you become a House of Representative and earn $174k a year with no experience and only a GED. I had to have a 4 year degree, 2 years of experience just to earn 50k annually. 


Where else can a politician tell lies in public and incite violence at work and get full support from her colleagues... Now if I'm not honest with a client or incite a fight at work, I'm definitely getting fired. But not these politicians.


We have to have some high standards and requirements to apply for a position in the House, Senate and WH. Just being over 25 and citizenship is not good enough."
artvandalay84,Suddenly the GOP takes being a serial liar seriously. Lol.
ZealousWolverine,"Name one job or career that doesn't immediately fire & blacklist the person who lied to get the job.

There is only one. It's politician."
MeetingKey4598,"No doubt Ryan was given the green light to push this out. McCarthy and other high ranking current House GOP do not want to be the ones with the statement.

If they can pressure Santos to resign with former forces then it washes their hands clean. If he does resign, expect there to be a statement from McCarthy respecting the decision, and then proceed to list ticky tacky things on prominent Dems' 'resumes' or interviews where there may have been slight embellishment.

They will 100% weaponize a Santos resignation against Dems, and they just want/ed to buy time to prepare their narrative. 'Why isn't this person resigning because when they were running they said that they got a 4.11 GPA at college when really it was revised to 4.09 because one course didn't apply to their GPA?'. And they won't cite a freshman Dem -- they'll target established, well credentialed boogeywomen like Pelosi, AOC, or Omar."
InevitableAvalanche,Amazing how these people I used to think were terrible are miles above the current GOP.
carrja99,"The modern Republican Party HATES Paul Ryan, FYI."
mikeysce,That moment when Paul Ryan has the moral high ground. :\
whatistheformat,"He's an albatross and they are slowly realizing it. Politicians act primarily in self-interest, Republicans especially so; so problems that affect the whole group don't make it through the ego bubbles without significant hammering.

And, clearly, some want Santos to succeed, so fraudulent credentials become normalized for the base, euphemized as  ""that makes him smart."""
apenature,Thanks...I guess?
MrPootie,Embellishment is fraudulent too.
HairTop23,"Omg this country's system is insane


Stop calling for resignation and REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE. he lied. Several times. He has broken several laws. He is not qualified to herd sheep, let alone steal more money from the people who stupidly elected him. Remove him from office already ffs this is dumb"
plynthy,Paul Ryan endorsed Trump after calling him a racist
frodosbitch,"Why is the GOP turning on him?  They have stomached a lot worse without a word.  Their logic seems to be - as long as he votes the way we want, we don’t care.   So what’s different here?

Edit - after thinking about it, it’s probably because he consistently voted for McCarthy as Speaker. His margin was so slim he’s not willing to risk making it slimmer."
Sohgin,Been seeing Ryan's name pop up a bit lately. I wonder if he's getting his name back out there for a presidential push.
AmericanWonton,How brave of Paul Ryan. I'm sure not having to worry about the fragile house makeup like McCarthy made Ryan grow at least a quarter inch of a a spine. /s
Rupaulsdragrace420,"If this is fair game left candidates should start posing as far right candidates in deeply red districts, then flip their vote after they're elected.

Santos can not stay in office."
colbyjackrat222,Fraudulent candidacy for a fraudulent party.
Pake1000,Isn't it weird how Republicans discover ethics only after they retire.
Ok_You_3316,That’s hilarious. The current GOP cabinet is founded on lies. They love liars (fat orange baby). They lie about everything (peaceful organized tour). They elect liars (Supreme court douchbags).
psychoticdream,Paul Ryan can't claim the moral high ground.  He helped create this.
caffeine314,I love how all these retired Republican politicians magically grow some ethics after they leave politics.
QuintinStone,"Today's GOP is even too far gone for Paul Ryan.  There's a reason he quit after Trump's win.

Republicans consider Paul Ryan a RINO."
No_Discount7919,"The GOP was playing with fire for too long. Paul Ryan is part of the group that knew and understood that a lot of their party’s actions was just theater.  Unfortunately this new group is part of the audience that watched the show and they thought it was real. So they’re continuing the tradition, only this time around, they aren’t acting."
Sasselhoff,"Always the ""former"" folks that come out and denounce shit.  *Never* the ""current""."
taylormadevideos,"Beau of the fifth column had a good breakdown: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_qtHMVI0Yng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qtHMVI0Yng)

Fundraising was the problem for the GOP. It had nothing to do with his other lies."
muffledvoice,The GOP has slipped pretty far when Paul Ryan has to lecture them about ethics and the importance of being honest.
Individual_Mousse_42,"Paul Ryan can fuck right the hell off, and he can take Santos along with him."
NariandColds,"Santos is the perfect example of the Republican cult. He had an R next to his name so the cult voted for him, qualifications and reality be damned."
eaglekineagle,"How I interpreted that tells me that he's alright with embellishment regarding candidates. Also, most GOP aren't upset that he lied, they're upset that Santos didn't get away with it. If people like Ryan are ok with embellishing, how can we know for sure he and others don't/won't do the same? With all that said, part of me appreciates that Santos did this, because it has the potential to undermine the rest of the GOP. After all, GOP supporters only like the digestible, bais confirming lies."
CarrieFisherStevens,"It’s a bit nutty how Paul Ryan, a man who was very much a part of the problem, is now a few shades removed from his party.

Same with Boener."
HEHENSON,"Regardless of his motivations, Paul Ryan is right about this."
dudewithahumanhead,"Every time I see a story about a Republican saying something reasonable or obviously true, inevitably it is about a ""former"" elected official. That sums up the problem right there. In order to be elected and remain in office, Republicans have to pander to their insane base voters."
Sea_Dawgz,"how can they care about this dude, he's no different than trump or mccarthy or any of the liars that are their entire party."
fencerman,But he won't.
borndovahkiin,He won’t resign. He’s going to wait until he gets away with it or is forcibly removed by Congress.
Guywith2dogs,I miss when Paul Ryan was considered a POS compared everyone else. Now I'd say Paul Ryan looks pretty good next to most of these clowns now
bubbaeinstein,Santos’ opponent was a f’ing idiot who didn’t bother to investigate him.
Captain_CatDad,"He looks like the kid who’s mom brought him to the water park for a classmates birthday, but he just sits by the concession stand and complains the whole time because nobody wants him there."
,"I will never stop thrilling to, and publicly lauding, the absolute heroism of those on the right who call out the batshit insanity in their party... as soon as they have nothing to lose."
Legendary_Lamb2020,If you lie on your resume you are fired. This person lied and their job is running the country
RDO_Desmond,He's right. If the GOP doesn't cause him to resign their abject indifference to the truth will get velcroed to the GOP writ large. They have enough credibility problems from years of silence to massive quantities of lies out of Trump's mouth.
Smrleda,The fact that McCarthy has not demanded Santos resign speaks volumes. Be reminded he is now speaker of the house. The Republican Party has no morals - no standards.  It is no surprise republicans embrace the fraud Santos is knowing they still are under the rule of Trump. The party has no backbone- they are a disgrace.
kezow,"Let's be honest, being a fraud and a liar clearly isn't a deal breaker for Republicans. They don't care if their candidates lies, cheats, steals, is involved in human trafficking, rapes minors, defrauds the government, or starts/supports a coup. All they need is an R behind their name and they are in!"
mdins1980,"Any one who had been following politics during the Obama years knows that Ryan is only saying this because he is no longer in Government.  He is as much a weasel as the current Republicans, its just now he has no skin in the game so he can actually be honest.  Otherwise he would be covering for this weasel like the rest."
Efficient_Island1818,"I hope absolutely no one thinks, for even a fraction of a nanosecond, that ryan would be saying this if he was in mccarth’s same position, needing every gqp vote he could count on."
ebdixbd,"Gotta grifter better bruh, no clout lmao"
ChildhoodLeft6925,"I feel like after the absolute disaster of the Bush Jr Administration the republicans were challenged to change some parts of their ideology but instead they doubled down especially with characters like Sarah Palin. And then the tripled down with trump. They’ve been on a downward spiral for the better part of 20 years and their answer is to stubbornly cling to anything that gives them any semblance of power. To spite their face. 

I just hope they don’t also bring down democracy in their quick decent into insanity"
taez555,"But he's not really.   He's just saying it so he can pretend to take the high road.    Everyone knows that if Santos resigns it'll cause a special election where a democrat will probably win and it'll drop the house GOP #'s down to only 3 votes in the majority.   

There are 435 members of the House.   Odds are a few will resign, be removed or even die while in office over the course of the next two years.  On average 5 members of congress leave mid term for one reason or another.   No one usually notices since the #'s are so high and the balance is usually off that it doesn't matter.  However now the #'s are so low and close, the house could easily flip back to the democrats controlling it in the next 2 years.     The GOP will NEVER risk that. 

Regardless of the lip service the GOP is currently giving for him to resign, Santos is here to stay."
Dimitri3p0,"To me, Santos seems like an almost perfect reflection of the current Republican party. Zero substance, 100% bullshit."
suffertunity,It's amazing how principled Republicans can be once they're out of office.
thebabes2,"He’s a shameless grifter who’s about to pull in $175k/year plus bennies, he’s not going anywhere."
BlueCollarBeagle,How dare anyone criticize a man who is a direct descendent of Amelia Earhart!
silent_buttviolent,I just don’t understand why he can’t be removed. We already know he is a complete fraud through and through. Why is he just allowed to continue? He won’t resign on his own.
ItisyouwhosaythatIam,"Tfg is fading, and Paul Ryan wants to return to politics, I'm guessing. Maybe a run for president in 2024? Or Senate?"
DivinePotatoe,"He forgot to add

""And if anyone knows anything about frauds, it's me, Paul Ryan."""
Jmacdekalb,Pinocchio Paul finally says something smart.
davekingofrock,"Welp, looks like republicans will now demonize Paul Ryan.  What a weird timeline."
undeniablysarah,This is why every candidate for Congress and the presidency should have a federal background investigation done on them before being allowed on the ticket. A fed investigator would have found out all of these lies easily. It should be the standard that elected leaders have a background check on their credentials and finances.  Why this doesn’t happen is beyond me.
monkfishjoe,"Jeez, I can't believe the day has come that I agree with Paul Ryan. How far things have changed in such a short period of time..."
OrbeaSeven,"Apparently there is no one to check on age, residency, citizenship requirements for Congressional members. Nice, huh? Seems our forefathers thought integrity would be enough."
pseudosympathy,Republicans suddenly care about their people lying?
Qubeye,"There is not a single job in the world where you could get away with this.

Congress should definitely not be the exception."
davesreddit123,"I wonder what media organizations were uncritically boosting or reporting on Santos during the election cycle. 
It looks like on local paper, The North Shore Leader, did discover Santos was a fraud in September of 2022 but it wasn't reported on anywhere else. 

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/small-local-paper-uncovered-and-reported-george-santos-scandal-before-november-election

https://www.theleaderonline.com/single-post/endorsement-robert-zimmerman-for-us-congress-ny3

This is probably a great opportunity to make the Federal Election Commission functional again. Santos didn't break any laws by lying about his qualifications, but it looks like he broke several campaign finance laws that can result in prison time. We need a working FEC to prevent more Santos's in the future."
TheAlbacor,I hope he stays simply to be a stain on the party. I want the GOP name to look more and more absurd so more independents wake up to it.
niceandsane,Santos reminds me of the Verizon “Can you hear me now” guy.
FinalRhyme_76,All I can think of is Al Franklin
,"He won’t. And nothing will happen. 

Remind me in 1.5 years, when he’s up for re-election and gets re-elected."
StumpVanDerHuge,"This is your legacy, Paul Ryan! Enjoy watching it burn down from the cheap seats with the rest of us!"
Battystearsinrain,Santos-  so NOW you care about lying?
Monimute,A basic background check on candidates seems appropriate these days. Any applicant to a white collar job would have to undergo one.
yumri,"As George Santos didn't stretch the truth but out right lied about what he has done and what happened to his family. Most of them embellish their accomplishments and exaggerate what they have done. That would be normal while outright lying about it is not. So I agree with Pual Ryan on that point that George Santoes should resign but I would change it to and let him run again on his actual record not made up stuff that makes him look good. 

It is the USA and he has the right to run for office. He also sadly has the right to lie to his own voters during campaign season. As outright lies normally comes out during while running for pollical office most do not lie but exaggerate the truth. As there is no law against him running for office like this in the USA he broke no law so he cannot be charged. The house has a mechanism to remove one of their own. [The way to do so is written into the US constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S5-C2-2-1/ALDE_00013580/) so the people who make up government cannot change it without a overly burdensome process. Good luck getting 2/3rd of the house to agree to it. As it is to overturn the vote of the people it is made to be a high bar to clear. It will then go back to the people to vote for a house representative for his replacement. It will depend on the state if he can run in that election. As it is New York he can run in it as most states allow for it.

The much easier way to remove him to convince him to resign. Congressmen and Congresswomen can at any point resign for whatever reason they want. Even if it is right after sworn into office. The rules for it are pretty loose."
empathica1,Who the fuck is Paul Ryan to tell former speaker George Santos to resign?
NunsNunchuck,"Current GOP Leadership isn’t calling for him to resign because:
1. It would flip to Democrat as he won in an upset
2. It would lower the already tiny GOP cushion in the House"
Can_Haz_Cheezburger,oh so *now* Paul Ryan grows a fuckin spine
fthotmixgerald,"On one hand, he's right. On the other, Paul Ryan is like the second dumbest person in Wisconsin. Gonna stuff that pencil necked little doofus into a locker."
jjs_east,"If McCarthy doesn’t kick him out, will the reps who are calling for Santos to resign vote to remove McCarthy or are they more concerned with having a body in a chair that can raise their hand when told to like McCarthy is?"
FrnakRowbers,Impeach.
My_Work_Accoount,"Honestly, if he came out and said he only did it for the health insurance I'd be like ""you know what, that's fair, I ain't even mad""."
bruhnions,"Levels of irony so deep, it is an earth resource"
longshot,"An embellished candidacy is also a fraudulent candidace.

Embellished taxes are fraudulent taxes.

Embellished credentials are fraudulent credentials."
xXPussyPounder9000Xx,This is truly an astonishing moment in post-Trump politics: Paul Ryan says something reasonable.
redmasc,"All I know is that if I ""embellished"" like Santos did on my work resume, I'd be shit canned and blacklisted pretty quick."
TheBigPhilbowski,"Yes AND.... fuck paul ryan as the ""voice of reason"" in any conversation. He's plenty responsible for the conditions that eventually lead to a george santos as a viable political candidate in the first place.

**Stop rewarding republicans for doing the bare minimum.** Now ryan, tell us about mcconnel, cruz, graham, hawley, marge greene trump and the rest of them - what should happen with them, in detail, you complicit fucking coward? And don't just say it, put down your walkman and your 3 pound dumbbells and work to fix what you helped to break.

*""Man who poured gasoline over everything and left warns about danger of one particular thing that catches fire, story at 11.""*"
5141121,"lol, that would require a shred of integrity, and we know that's far more than Santos has.

Also lol at Paul Ryan high-roading about anything."
spook30,Only the bottom feeder will work with this guy.
itsthisausername,A plant
wordsonascreen,Notice that they made no objection UNTIL Santos was sworn in. It was more appropriate that they claim the seat as being Republican than being ethical about the man.
KillerPussyToo,GOP will do nothing to get rid of this fraud because he’s one of their useful idiots.
Masterlessamurai,"He’s not going to resign and thankfully so because he will be the epitome of why America despises the GOP, party of inherent frauds."
AnalSoapOpera,Lmao. Why would anyone listen to Paul Ryan?
IndependenceLegal746,"Yea cause he’s going to listen to him. If there is anything republicans in congress have taught me, it is that they do not resign unless they’re voted out or die. Ryan sure loved helping get the train off the tracks and is now shocked pikachu about the fact that it is actually a runaway train on course for a collision. Enjoy the spoils of your work buddy."
Alice-Grant,The election should be nullified - do they really not have some other reprehensible Republican (who doesn’t lie about it) they can replace him with?
BoromirWasInnocent,Paul Ryan was instrumental in the dismantling of our civil rights. He is a key pin to what’s happening to us today. Fuck him.
pants363,Paul Ryan disappeared at the perfect time to save his career. He went into hiding grew a beard and kept himself “clean” and now he will emerge to try and salvage whatever there’s left of the Republican Party and looking like an angel while doing it.
Ill-Hope-4752,Santos is the new Trump. Accurately represents the new party.
cipherSoreEyes,Remember when I said McDonalds has more meaningful qualifications for their applicants than any public office? Guess what types of ppl are attracted to jobs that require zero qualifications?
MammothSufficient601,The problem with Paul is that he NEVER  would had said these words when he was House Speaker.
PlantainCreative8404,So what. Until they put pressure on McCarthy this turd won't get flushed.
The_Captain_LIGMA,When one of the shittiest people you know makes a good point.
