VyrPlan,"well, somebody spent a lot of money to get this clown stuffed into the Right's clown car 

if you tried to pitch this guy as a character in a fictional story you'd get laughed out of the room"
was_and_wasnt,It's amazing just how many republicans can be linked to Russians.
carolinapanthagurl,"McCarthy was so desperate to be Speaker that he didn't want to look into Santos.  Now, we're finding out that Santos is a Russian plant of a sanctioned oligarch who wanted McCarthy to be Speaker.  I hope this leads to more revelations of money laundering and other financial crimes.  It's time to clean House."
semaphore-1842,"This is a gift link with no paywalls, but here's the meat of it:

> Taken together, the evidence suggests Santos may have had a business relationship with Intrater as Santos was first entering politics in 2020. It also shows, according to the SEC filing, that Intrater put hundreds of thousands of dollars into Santos’ onetime employer, Harbor City, which was accused by regulators of running a Ponzi scheme. Neither Santos nor Intrater responded to requests for comment. Attorneys who have represented Intrater also did not respond.

#

> While Intrater is a U.S. citizen, his company, the investment firm Columbus Nova, has historically had extensive ties to the business interests of his Russian cousin, billionaire Viktor Vekselberg. As recently as 2018, when Vekselberg was sanctioned by the Treasury Department for his role in the Russian energy industry, his conglomerate was Columbus Nova’s largest client, the company confirmed to The Post that year.

> Intrater’s interactions in 2016 and 2017 with Michael Cohen, who at the time was working as a lawyer for Donald Trump, were probed during special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible links between Trump and the Kremlin.

> Intrater’s company paid the lawyer and self-described Trump fixer to identify deals for his business, and court records show they exchanged hundreds of texts and phone calls."
mjoav,The GOP is a Russian asset.
new-6reddit9,Treason runs deep with Republicans
jeeepblack,Russia has been involved with his entire campaign.  This guy is a Russian asset.  Nobody gets 700k without expectations.

Vekselberg Meets With Cohen

In Michael Cohen’s Trump Tower office, he and Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg discuss a mutual desire to strengthen Russia’s relations with the United States under President Trump. Also in attendance is Vekselberg’s cousin, Andrew Intrater, chief executive of an American investment firm — Columbus Nova — whose biggest client is Vekselberg’s Renova Group. The three men agree to see each other at Trump’s  inauguration. A week later, they are together at a dinner celebrating the inauguration.

**Jan. 20, 2017**

Vekselberg, Veselnitskaya, Akhmetshin and Butina Attend Trump Inauguration Festivities; Cohen Gets Big Contract
The FBI is concerned that key Russian elites and others associated with Putin’s government are attending Trump inauguration events. Among them is Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who attends a Trump inauguration dinner as a guest of Andrew Intrater, chief executive of investment firm Columbus Nova. Intrater is Vekselberg’s cousin, and Vekselberg’s firm — Renova Group — is Columbus Nova’s largest client. Days after the inauguration, Columbus Nova awards Michael Cohen a $1 million consulting contract."
daclampzx2,"GOP just selling America to Russian oligarchs. They can't even be deluding themselves at this point, can they?"
hecate37,"In late November, the Daily Beast reported that Andrew Intrater — a cousin of and money manager for sanctioned Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg — gave more than $56,000 to political committees supporting Santos, who defeated Democrat Robert Zimmerman Nov. 8.

Some background: 

Viktor Vekselberg is a Ukrainian-born oligarch with links to donations to both the Clinton Foundation and the Trump inaugural fund. Vekselberg, who has ties with Putin and has publicly advocated for lifting U.S. Sanctions on Russia, previously served on the board of the sanctioned Russian oil company Rosnef and reportedly holds “signicant interest” in Oleg Deripaska’s company, Rusal. Vekselberg was part of the financial conglomerate Alfa-Access-Renova Consortium alongside fellow oligarchs Mikhail Fridman, German Khan, and Len Blavatnik. He also owns the diversfied holding company Renova Group. 

Andrew Intrater, the CEO of Columbus Nova, which has been described as “the U.S. investment vehicle for the Renova Group,” donated $250,000 to Trump’s inauguration fund. Prior to this donation, the Trump campaign had criticized Hillary Clinton after it was revealed that the Clinton Foundation had accepted large donations from Renova Group. Vekselberg has come in contact with several individuals linked to the Trump Campaign. He attended the December 2015 RT anniversary gala alongside both Michael Flynn and Putin. He also attended a 2014 fundraising event for the Moscow Jewish Museum, which was attended by both Jared and Ivanka Trump. Vekselberg also has ties to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross due to a 2014 partnership with Renova Group involving the Bank of Cyprus; Renova Group is currently the largest shareholder in Bank of Cyprus, while Wilbur Ross served on the bank’s Board for several years before becoming Secretary of Commerce."
Motor_Somewhere7565,"Boy, does Russia love its useful idiots"
Icy-Morning-4896,"Now it becomes clear where GOP leaders get their marching orders from. Russian sympathizers, and a steroid-taking troll doll. I'm starting to think QAnon was created by the Kremlin."
Searchlights,"You have to assume that others had their campaigns funded by Russia.  Maybe you can't prove it, but you know these things are happening and it would explain a lot.  With all the money that was funneled in through the NRA, and the ability to mask everything through SuperPACs there's no way of knowing how much of Congress has been infiltrated."
GDPisnotsustainable,"Woah… this is a huge revelation considering the proxy war we are sinking hundreds of millions of dollars a day into.

- AND the GOP will road block anything from happening *again* to own the libs (like any other national security threat)"
subliver,I have yet to see a photo of George Santos without that same shit eating grin. What gives?
mvw2,"There's a LOT of Russian sympathy in the right.  When we think of spies and operatives, this is not Russia planting Russian people.  It's turning US citizens by leveraging them or catering towards their interests.  Well, we have a lot of people who's sole interest in politics is to get rich, and Russia is all too happy to oblige.  It may start with campaign funding, but it quickly turns into political favors.  Pretty soon you're no longer working for the US.  Congratulations, you have now become a foreign agent and spy.  This it's a position a lot of Republicans are putting themselves into, or already have.  Numerous media entities have also placed themselves into this position."
oftendreamoftrains,"About 20 years ago I heard a program on NPR that played a voice recording that, at that time, was itself about 20 years old. So, the original recording was from the 1960's.  If I remember correctly, it was either an interview or a speech by Kruschev. It might have even been his shoe banging speech from the U.N.  

He said something like this: We will wait, and as we are waiting, we will slowly infiltrate the U.S. We have patience and can wait a long time, but we will be successful. 

I know it's not exactly what he said, but that's the gist of it. That Russia would continue to steadily work to influence, change, harm and possess the U.S., no matter how long it would take. 

And we are now at that moment.

Edit: original recording was from the 60's,  not 20 years old at the time I heard it. More like 40. Math isn't my strong suit."
,"Uh yeah, the GOP is compromised. Just look at all their propaganda outlets. Why are we supporting Ukraine? Why is Russia so bad? Trying to condition their base.

Melodic-Chemist-381,"Great, another Trump."
-Economist-,"I will keep beating this drum:

There is something here. This dude was in poverty and then magically had $300k to lend himself? Changes his name?

He was plucked by dark money to do some dirty work. They were just careless with his backstory. They won’t be as careless next time.

Our current form of government is about two election cycles from being over. There is a much larger story we are missing. This goes far beyond power and greed. You don’t need politicians like this to perpetuate power and greed. This is a coup from within. But why? 
What are we missing?"
phillbert0,"How is this guy not at least a foreign asset, at most a full blown spy?"
ShakesbeerMe,The entirety of the GOP appears to be compromised Russian assets.
Firepower01,I wonder how compromised our government actually is. We genuinely have a fifth column in this country representing Russian interests. Russian propaganda networks literally show clips of Tucker Carlson to justify their actions.
iWORKBRiEFLY,National. Security. Risk. That's exactly what he is. He needs to be removed ASAP.
Victor_van_Heerden,Is Santos a Russian agent?
NotOSIsdormmole,And there it is!
spaitken,"“After a through investigation of these claims, our new and improved Ethics committee did indeed discover h the R next to his name and concluded that he did nothing wrong.” - Kevin McCarthy, very soon."
laughsatdadjokes,How much of this nonsense must the people endure until this sad lying person is removed from office.   C’mon
fleurgirl123,And there you go.
schillsboro,"Where there’s smoke, I mean a shit load of smoke, there might be, just might be ………wait for it……..a fire?  Or a piece of human garbage who needs to be removed from office?"
Kantsas,"Don't be alarmed.  I'm sure he cozied up to Russia to give them a stern warning.

That's why my senator flew to Russia on July 4 so you know he meant business."
PoopulistPoolitician,Weird how there is no alarm in our government with how easily a foreign power is able to get a pawn elected within the same major political party.
lrpfftt,"Every headline about this guy should just read ""George Santos: It keeps getting worse"""
disasterbot,No proof of collusion!!! /s
ribald_jester,Thank you Justice Roberts once again for *Citizens United* the worst fucking thing ever!
Charyou-Tree,"Is this better or worse than Rand Paul hand delivering a letter to putin on Independence Day?

The whole GOP are russian assets, they want to be oligarchs in the corporate-state petrochemical enterprise like putin is."
cervidaetech,Russia is waging an incredibly successful war to destroy America from within and noone is doing anything to stop it
trent58,"Republicans are owned by Russia. Period. They are elected foreign agents working to sabotage the United States. And they are not hiding it, and nobody can do anything."
Atheios569,Of course there’s a Russian connection. This shit is getting old.
cwn01,The Republican Party is still endorsing con-men. sigh..
Sanctimonius,"I wish news articles would stop using the name George Santos, as we aren't even sure if that's who this person is. Which when you think about it is fucking ludicrous."
OmegaXesis,"Holy fucking shit, this is the kind of guy TREASON laws need to be applied to."
PullinUpBootstraps,"What Russia proved with Trump and doubled down on Santos with is with the right amount of money they can get whoever they fucking want elected into office in this country, and because our system is so broken, we can't do a single thing about it. We're absolutely fucked, folks."
Gerald-Duke,"You know normally at a job they suspend you until the investigation of a crime is complete, and you either get fired with no pay for that time or you come back with pay for the time gone"
TimeTravelingChris,Why can't we openly talk about the GOPs Russia problem? How is this not a bigger deal?
needs-more-metronome,Still can’t believe this guy tried to play it off like he said he was “Jew-ish” 😂
Woodshadow,Normally I would say that might a coincidence but with the rest of this guy's life idk. Honestly I'm a little worried this guy might just be a legit spy
Mattrbts,"Turns out Santos is really a Melissa McCarthy character in her new Russian spy comedy. 

Playing live on news networks nightly."
Boo_R4dley,I’m starting to feel like Santos is a red herring. He’s just such a blatantly obvious Russian plant. If we came across communications tomorrow that showed his only purpose is to distract from bigger and more powerful Russian assets I would not be surprised at all.
ooouroboros,This guy had the stink of Russia all over him when you saw McCarthy protecting him.
pottman,I suspect George Santos is really three kids wearing a suit.
jedre,"But yeah, the GOP isn’t riddled with Russian assets. Nothing to see here folks, move along."
Anarchris427,"This guy is clearly a massive queef, but how can there be this much dirt on one person?"
pennyhustlers,Lock him up
J_Keezey,The GOP is owned by Putin.

Why is the GOP up to their ears in Russians?"
ParticleShine,"These people are literally traitors by definition, how much more are we willing to take?"
obrazovanshchina,Well now we know the source of the dark money. That's useful.
Eatit6560154,The Deep State in action.
mild-hot-fire,Republicans are Russian assets
WarmanHopple,Been waiting for the Russian link. No wonder republicans wanted him on the intel committee
Morgan-Explosion,"This guy has Russian plant written all over him. 

The Russians always see Americans as ridiculously gullible, all you have to do is lie spend money and you can subvert any level of America. 

They practice this to extremes with people so over the top that if you wrote them into a movie no one would believe it. Yavanovich, Manafort, this clown.

Its insane that it still fucking works. Every single time."
Pashoomba,Russpublicans!!
palmpoop,Dude is a standard Republican.
Locith,"In the past few years, several Russian spies have been caught using Brazilian passports. I’m not saying that Santos is a Russian spy, but it’s hardly shocking that a sleaze-bag from Brazil has nefarious connections to Russia.

Is he even gay?"
The_Pandalorian,Excellent. I look forward to nothing to continue to happen to hold anyone accountable.
Stormcrow6666,The entire Republican party is rife with Russian assets.
Dentalfloss_cowboy,Whenever I read this level of republican hijinx I think of Al Franken.
Connect_Stretch9476,There seems to be more and more coming out on this guy. I think we have a poster child for the republican party.
_Mister_Shake_,What a strange coincidence.. it seems like a lot of republicans have personal and financial ties to Russia.
essaitchthrowaway,"This entire Santos saga is a testament to how *awful* our news media is in reporting on the history of Republican candidates.  

Just like with candidate Trump, who had decades worth of corruption and crooked business dealings they could have reoorted on.  Tons of lawsuits, accusations left and right.  There was a clear history of corruption that took almost no digging to find.  And yet the mainstream news media chose not to.  Same with this Santos character."
,"George Santos is a conventionally unattractive, overweight, deeply insecure gay man who has turned to lying to give his life value because he doesn’t get it from the people he desires it from. Ultimately, he absolutely loathes who he is deep down."

heman81,"This guy is going to be fine, unless he votes democrat."
wirefox1,"Newsflash:  Santos to announce later today that he is, in fact, the Second Coming.

Good Grief.  Open the doors to the psychiatric hospitals!  Free them because therein lies the new world leaders!

The freakin' guy is mentally ill, and so very, very dumb that he's too stupid to even cover his tracks with all the lies he tells.

Crazy as a road lizard, dumb as a rock.  Truly Republican Presidential Material."
Hellinar,"“Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.""
""It's just a role. ""George Santos"", see, it's not real."""
DigitallyExhausted,And republicans will applaud him for it and make him chair of the ethics committee probably.
fuckzwift,Republicans will never get rid of him then. He's truly one of them.
Rojorurba,He’s an operative for political chaos
politirob,At what point can we shame and direct our ire to his stupid ass voters that put him into power 😩😩
Trix_Are_4_90Kids,"It always leads back to the Russians, doesn't it?"
TityTroi,"Imagine being responsible for voting in this clown

It’s time we publically shame the people who vote for politicians like Santos/Boebert and ostracize them from society. They are the people fucking over this country, without them we wouldn’t have these clowns in office."
mynamejulian,"He’s been installed as a chaos agent. Now that Speaker Marjorie Taylor Greene has to act as normal as possible to continue playing the game, he will be the new distraction for all their anti-democracy legislation and actions."

chalkoutlin3,damn.. this just keeps getting better
imonassid,Knew he was an operative
Error_404_403,"Russia connection… who could have thought.. /s
The set is complete."
mettiusfufettius,Who the fuck knows who this guy is and what masters he actually serves. The only thing we know for sure is that his entire candidacy was fraudulent and he absolutely cannot serve in public office.
Tyndael87,Of course.
CockCozies,"He is clearly a foreign asset and should be removed from the House for national security purposes, then investigated to the nth degree."
JohnDunstable,Is Santos going to get window cancer?
Moony2433,Jfc
bluelifesacrifice,"Hey Republicans, this is your shadow government crap you keep thinking democrats are. Right here."
MoveItSpunkmire,"Fucking Domestic terrorist shithead. 
He should be removed"
This_is_McCarth,This. Fucking. Guy.
PhD_Pwnology,Average Republican these days.
MistakeNice1466,Republican = russian. No wonder the national party is insisting on keeping him.
LastVisitorFromEarth,That explains where his money comes from
tyriancomyn,So that’s how he suddenly got all this money and support. He’s a Russian plant to fuck with our politics… and republicans are there to eat it up like a cat licking up it’s own vomit.
LaVidaYokel,I’m starting to feel like I am one of the few people that doesn’t have some kind of ties to Russian oil men.
Spare-Chest7695,"Wait, what!? Another republican linked to Russian money?  Can we just finally admit that the US doesn’t exist anymore because clearly we’re owned by Russia."
ToucanFarthing,This should say: *George Santos linked to Russian oligarch.* Drop the cousin nonsense.
EforieNord,why is it always the GOP with ties to Russian oligarchs? why is it always them?
Udbdhsjgnsjan,"A Republican with tenuous ties to Russia?!? 

[surprised pikachu face]"
DaBaTaKa,"Instead of revealing new damning information about this sociopath every day, why isn't he getting removed from office?"
Quirky_Independence2,"I posted somewhere that he was probably a Russian asset.

As a joke.

Suppose they got all the others, so they figured they didn’t have to worry about anyone noticing. Getting sloppy after so much success.

How many of them went to Moscow on 4 July?"
robertevans343,It’s a colossal security f*ck up that this man is allowed to walk the halls of Congress.
LowDownSkankyDude,"This is exactly what I meant when I said it was odd they let someone so obviously compromised, take office. He's literally a wanted criminal, with Russian ties, and the gop, staying completely on brand, was like ""this is our guy"". It's fucking insane."
Significant-Reward-8,.....and it all comes back to Russia and the republican party
koshgeo,"Sigh.  I always hope the worst isn't true, but, come on.  That's a coincidence worthy of investigating further.

At least he picked a better company name than ""Fraud Guarantee""."
god_Boi,Republicans are way too gullible—my gawd…
Boring-Scar1580,"I was wondering how long it would for someone to link him somehow to ""Russia""   and to an Oligarch , no less."
shamalonight,I’m beginning to wonder why none of this deep investigative journalism wasn’t done when a Democrat could have benefited from it.
Thisam,"There appear to be several Russian-financed nut jobs in our Congress.  If only we had a committee to investigate ethical problems and a separate department to also investigate and then prosecute.

I realize much of this info is anecdotal but there is too much of it to ignore, given that Russian interference to help the GOP has already been proven."
Tony_Stark_0,Do we even know for sure this jackasses' name is really 'George Santos'?
BonIsDead,"So now surely Republicans will toss him out, right? Nah. They probably like him even more now. Fucking fascists"
dino_miami,I get Jared from Subway vibes from Santos.
Physical_Bobcat_2066,Something tells me a lot of republicans are linked to Russian oligarchs. They certainly don’t have to be qualified or honorable.
Anotherdumbawaythrow,Chances Santos “commits suicide” in the not so distant future?
pickles4521,Just dump this guy already. He shouldn't be in congress. What a shame.
makashiII_93,They replaced Tulsi with “George” or “Anthony”.
Jerk182,Yet another example of laundered Russian campaign contributions by the GOP.
Caymonki,"If you follow the Ukraine/Russia (totally not a) War. You will see a lot of similar talking points and excuses/hypocrisy as the GOP. Russian money is deep in American politics and you have to pretend very hard to argue against that fact. 

Not shocked, probably don’t have to look too hard to find more links. The GOP has no intention to look though."
Neilthemick,Why do we put up with treason?
greenso,Not gonna lie - if nothing else this man lives an interesting life lol
T8ert0t,At what point are we just going to have Santos pull off his mask to reveal it's been Maria Butina this entire time?

Curious_Working5706,The United States of America is currently under a new type of “cold war” attack by the Russians and it is extremely pathetic that about half of the American public is fine with it (because the Russians discovered their drug of choice: hate).
