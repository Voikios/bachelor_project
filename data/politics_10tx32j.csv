Salty_Letterhead,This guy has stumbled onto the Trump method of being in the news literally every single day
OppositeDifference,">Mr. Myers said in the letter that he was alone with Mr. Santos in his office on Jan. 25 when the congressman asked him whether he had a profile on Grindr, a popular gay dating app. Then, he said, Mr. Santos invited him to karaoke and touched his groin, assuring him that his husband was out of town.

Guess we find out just how bad McCarthy wants that house seat"
BriSnyScienceGuy,"How dare you accuse an astronaut, elf, and professor of patent law of such things? He didn't die on the shores of Tripoli to be slandered! An 11 time US Open (combined golf and tennis) champion deserves better!"
dancingmeadow,"This is your party now, Republicans."
BarbellsandBurritos,He just got there and he’s GOP’ing at a 3rd term level.
beckerrrrrrrr,Are we sure this is true? Wasn’t he flying that F-22 shooting down the balloon when this happened?
exiledfromreality,"Already? How stupid IS this guy? He is under investigation for many, many, things and he does something like this in his first few weeks in office? How quickly the Democrats would have removed him from office if he happened to be in the other party? He'd be out already!"
Yitram,I'm am starting to believe he was grown in a lab to be the perfect Republican.
kmurph72,We are entering complete psychopath territory now. Wait until the GOP finds out that it's not a girl. They will be so disappointed.
internetbrowser23,"It takes a bold and or stupid man to sexually harass someone in your office, while actively being investigated for dozens of other crimes."
Jammyhobgoblin,"This is off topic, but has he aged significantly in the past few weeks or are they using increasingly unflattering photos?"
antigop2020,Between this guy and Matt Gaetz and the other GOP crazies idk how anyone can call themselves a Republican nowadays.
bmwlocoAirCooled,"15 minutes is up.

Someone get rid of this lying scum."
-praetorr-,Republican Speed Run.
DramaticallyOxygen,"After all the news that has come out about this guy, honestly this is the least surprising headline to read about him"
defiCosmos,That didn't take long...
djchanclaface,"The next step is democrats running as republicans. It’d be super easy to just cosplay as a complete piece of shit at this point and get elected. Lie about everything. AI generated Trump endorsements. Insane campaign promises. Be pro-genocide. Complete fiction. You could then vote in line with democrats all the time and just start screeching “fake news” if anyone asks you about it. Double down. Triple down. Deny and lie. Get a friend to accuse you of sexual assault every once in a while and make sure to break as many laws as possible while stuffing your pockets full of bribes to stay visibly republican. Vote like Che Guevara. A lot of actual helpful policy could get passed.

The system needs to be broken to bring back accountability. Republicans want to destroy reality? Want a completely gullible constituency? That’s ripe for exploitation. Grifters making a shitty buck is a waste of this gift."
LegDayDE,"In the UK any one of the things he has been accused of would be enough for him to be forced to resign... Because the political parties would not want to be associated with it. Why do the GOP want to be associated with it? They're the party of ""power at all costs"" and that's how we ended up with Trump, a broken supreme court, and now this conman in Congress."
ZookeepergameOk8231,What took him so long?
realhighstonerguy,"Everytime something comes out I say to myself ""surely this will be the straw that breaks the camels back"" and then there's another thing"
Nopants_Jedi,"If this is true, I am completely unsurprised."
TalboGold,Sounds like American Presidential Material
ihateredditmodzz,The Republican Party is cartoonishly corrupt
El_mochilero,"Poor guy just can’t catch a break!

Ghost2Eleven,Dude was sworn in last month. He’s really wasted no time.
PoopStickler69,"The George Santos Bingo Card is 80 feet high and 80 feet wide. 

The same size as the toxic dildo he must have stuck in his ass."
dullship,"It won't matter. Nothing matters anymore. We're through the looking glass here, people."
conditerite,I’m expecting that eventually it will be revealed that George Santos was banned for life from Sephora for making excessive returns.
MrKomiya,"The best part is that even when this is denied (validly or otherwise) by Santos his track record with the truth should automatically make anything he says suspect at best, an outright lie at worst. 

I say “should” because of the party of “I can’t hear you because my fingers are in my ears but if you don’t do what I want I’ll p*ss & sh*t all over the room”"
EggplantGlittering90,This dude is a gleaming example of todays perfect republican candidate.
Gogogo9,"[https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/leaked-audio-george-santos](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/leaked-audio-george-santos)

Amazingly, the staffer is even crazier than Santos.

They sound like they're all cosplaying Batman villains."
wrested_development,"There is no way this will go anywhere, regardless of the facts. Myers releasing secretly recorded audio of Santos before this complaint came to light will taint any investigation and the House Ethics Committee will side with Santos and claim Myers is trying to set him up"
Cellophane7,">Mr. Myers claimed that the alleged harassment occurred five days before he secretly recorded Mr. Santos. In that conversation, audio of which was published by Talking Points Memo, Mr. Myers declared his fealty to Mr. Santos, telling him, “We’re all George, this is how we got here. We’re just masters of the game.”

>At another point, Mr. Myers says on the recording, “I will never lie to you guys. I have no reason to. But I will lie for you.”

Yeah, this just sounds like he was upset he didn't get hired. I'll reserve my judgement until the investigation happens and any evidence turns up, but until then, I'm pretty skeptical. This guy has every reason to make shit up to spite the person who spurned him.

I'll totally buy that Santos sexually harassed this person, as it seems to be second nature to him. But it leaves a bad taste in my mouth trusting the word of a former sycophant who sat on this until he had nothing to gain from speaking up."
catdracula17,Wow. That didn’t take long
Boodikii,So what you're saying is that he's a model picture perfect Republican?
Gullible_Bar_284,He will fit in just fine with the GOP
rafits,Republican President speedrun
GenXUser,"At least he isn't Muslim, they would kick him off Congressional Committees for that."
DubyaWolf,I bet this why he stepped away from his committee assignments this week
Estoye,Is there a single redeeming quality about this corrupt motherfucker?
EfficiencyMajestic52,hes been there like a month lol
firesoul377,Not surprised in the slightest
Ivotedforher,"Leave this hero alone, he just got done shooting down that balloon."
akotlya1,"Honestly, keep him in. I want to see how far this goes. This guy is batting negative a thousand and it's fascinating to watch. As someone originally from long Island I can say with absolute certainty that this is absolutely on brand. Burn brightly you magnificent garbage fire."
Oldmanred79,Is this a fuckin Advent calendar or something for him? I swear tomorrow he gets in the news for eating a baby.
grumpyfrench,he is  distraction
ArmadilloDays,"Awwww.

Anyway, how much bacon can you put on a BLT before it’s “too much”???"
Cream253Team,This fucker hasn't even been in office for two months.
issamaysinalah,"He's just filling all the requirements for the republican party, next step is pedophilia"
TheKeyMaster1874,"I will sound like a boomer here but I'm not actually one I swear!

I remember a time when a politician this disgraced would quit because he knew he was bringing the role into disrupte. How is this walking bunion still in the news?!"
Dm-me-a-gyro,His accuser is a genius.  Who would believe Santos for a minute? I’m embarrassed I didn’t accuse him first
Ed_Derick_,"And still nothing’s gonna happen to him , he will just keep “working” and gaining thousands and thousands of dollars. Meanwhile if a black guy looks the wrong way to a cop he’s fucking executed in front of everyone. 

Fuck this world man."
CaptFluffyBunny,"Let's be real, they could find a dead body in his office and Santos holding the murder weapon, and it wouldn't make a difference. As long as he promises to vote the way he is supposed to, he will stay in office. The republican party only wants to win at all costs regardless of what is best for the nation, it's a suicide pack and they're taking the country with them. This is 60 years of planning and scheming, and sadly it works."
Artichoke_dip3,I just wish he would go the fuck away. Go fall in an imaginary well or something
JahEthBur,"Bro, should run for President at this point.  He is the embodiment of the principles of the GOP."
legitmadman82,This guy is a train wreck.
PMUrAnus,"Classic misdirection. 

Now instead of talking about all the frauds and felonies, we are talking about his sexual harassment.  

Don’t let that distract you from the fact that there is no low republicans won’t go to just to hang on to power. Imagine republican pearl clutching if santos was a democrat"
seanightowl,At this rate he will be the GOP presidential candidate for 2024.
MechanicalTurkish,Gotta hand it to this guy for checking all the boxes in the conservative scumbag playbook in record time. Jesus Christ
bilvester,Man the republicans are giving him the Madison cawthorn treatment

Allegedly."
Dad2DnA,"That didn't take long, unsurprisingly"
WontArnett,That was quick!
Gordon_Goosegonorth,It wouldn't surprise if this were all true. It also wouldn't surprise me if the staffer is full of shit. Thus it is always when dealing with Republicans.
HulaViking,Is there anything he hasn't done?
gravitywaveshello,The only thing that would make me stop and think “maybe he didn’t do it” is if he confessed.
TheFrederalGovt,It almost seems like he is doubling down Trump style at this point rather than putting his head down and focusing on the job he was elected to do.
SirLawrenceCCLXX,Well that was fast.
teenagesadist,"Hah, speed running congress."
VirgoDog,Already. It's not even a full month yet.
chillipowder01,"This dude is the worst of the worst. How has he not been excised by his own party or resigned by now?

Oh right… he’s Republican. And is suitably morally bankrupt."
prodigy1367,Yet another mark on my GOP politician bingo card
Aliceable,He’s really doing the republican speed run

Electronic_Permit300,"I think at this point Santos is doing everything in his psychopathic mindset to see if McCarthy and GOP will kick him out.  I'm betting on, they won't."

nosotros_road_sodium,"Santos, the living Crooked Politician Bingo Card."
KR1735,"If I didn't believe it before, I'd say we're officially in the twilight zone if Republicans turn a blind eye to a sitting politician having a homosexual affair."

bunnieollie,"No, no, he was just sexual harassment-ish…"
quesadilla79,"as confident as someone who like all of us saw trumps accountant get 5 months for decades of crimes, and trump's still free."
wildcarde815,That didn't take long....
jake_edwards01,How is this fucker even real?  This has to be a glitch in the damn matrix. 😳
1ofZuulsMinions,"Someone commented once that George Santos was a real-life version of Roger from American Dad. 

So now my husband and I only refer to him as:

*Ricky Spanish*"
NiteShdw, Well that was fast. It’s only been a a month.
nodeicenada,Even if it isn’t true (reading only the headline first before commenting ) who in their right mind would believe him first?
Ventiny,"I am officially endorsing George Santos for Senate in 2024.  He is a man for all seasons, and the senator NY needs and deserves."

GraceJoans,">George Santos Is **Accused of Sexual Harassment** in His Capitol Office

>The complaint was made by a man seeking work as a House aide, whose bid for a job was rejected because he **faced criminal wiretapping charges** in Ohio.


Do republicans ever fucking rest? Are they always up to no good? 

That aside, I’m sorry the victim endured this. Santos is a con artist and danger to national security. We do not know who this man is, where his finding actually is from, and to whom are his allegiances. It’s not comical it’s dangerous."
davefive,Dude. I keep telling people he is just a filler trying to pivot how bad trump was. Just so trump can run again. Santos eats glue but trump wants to keep your guns. This is a dirty parlay.
CaptainDildobrain,"Well, that didn't take long!"
Leslesser,Man am I ever sick of seeing this guy and his ugly puss…I can’t wait for his news cycle to be over.
Bozzo2526,Always the ones you expect huh
moschles,"> Santos's sexuality has remained unclear to the public. Despite having previously come out as gay,[174] Santos was married to a woman from 2012 to 2019.

This rabbithole has no bottom to land on."
Fit-Firefighter-329,"And yet he got an AR-15 lapel pins too, and the GOP was saying on Twitter yesterday that all Republicans should follow and support him. He's not going to resign, even if he winds up in prison; and Republicans will still love him."
toddles822,He's only been in office for about a month and he's already one of the most universally despised people in the country. Impressive
Rumbananas,Tin foil hat time. George Santos is a test to see how much Republicans can get away with.
one2buckle,Is this guy going to be the next president?
Twice_Knightley,He's the dangerous drag queen his party warned us about.
13thJen,It almost feels like he made a bet with somebody that he can get himself elected & then kicked out of Congress within six months and now he's getting desperate he's going to lose.
Kind-Detective1774,I'm surprised it took this long for accusations of this kind to come out.
Soundslikeamelody420,Trump: „Look at this amateur!“

ifallsmn218,"Thing is, as much as I think this guy is a sniveling rat in the bottom of a barrel of dead roaches (and apparently has the personality & pulse of a cold fish), I’m not sure what else people can do to remove him. 

And all these unverified allegations could do one of two things to someone with this kind of personality disorder: either he becomes more oppositional/defiant or he turns inward and self-harms. Then the right-wing will say the media killed him. This man is a 35-year-old with clearly no adult coping skills whatsoever, and by 35 he’ll never change. 

It’d be interesting to learn the truth about his parents & family to see how all this started. He reminds me a lot of serial killer Andrew Cunanan; the man who killed Versace."
Eijishinrow,Sounds like a normal day for a republican
jjo826,"How exciting is it to live in a country where we get to pay for his pension and healthcare for the rest of his life? I mean how lucky are we to have the privilege to watch the entertainment of his media circus while he simultaneously votes to deny Americans the benefits he enjoys on our dime? 

What an amazing time to be American!  Greatest country on earth.  We are truly blessed."
