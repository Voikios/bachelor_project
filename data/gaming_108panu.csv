wickedweather,And Sony's first electrical device was a rice cooker.  And Toyota used to only weave fabric.
RoboticXCavalier,The anime movie 'Summer Wars' is a great shout out to the story of Nintendo - it has as essential plot devices (pun intended) the use of both the 3ds and the traditional KoiKoi/Hanafuda card game. Good movie

sharrrper,"My favorite ""trick"" trivia question:

Nintendo released rhe GameBoy on a major anniversary of their founding. Which anniversary?

If I want to give an extra hint I'll mention it ends in a zero.

With the hint most people will guess 10th or *maybe* 20th. The correct answer is the 100th."

You see, there are just too many words, and I am very busy, so if someone could just highlight the important ones here, I‚Äôd be greatly appreciative."
Darkchyylde,"Yeah, this is well known"
FILTHMcNASTY,Thank god for that red circle I had no idea what we were talking about

adamyhv,"Nintendo was founded in a very interesting year.

Nintendo was founded when Brazil was still an Empire, roughly two months before the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic in november 15th and the year Brazil adopted the modern flag (with 21 stars at the time) and the imperial family were forced to exile in Paris. 1889 was also the year of the Meiji Constitution. The Dakota was separated into two Dakotas, Montana and Washington were also about to became states, signed by President Glover. Hitler, Ant√≥nio Salazar (spanish dictator) and Charles Chaplin were born in 1889. The first report of the influeza flu in the 1889 - 1890 pandemic, also know as Russian Flu or Asian Flu. The year Van Gogh painted Starry Night and the invention of the Margherita (pizza) by Raffaele Esposito."

NiNj4_C0W5L4Pr,"Jack the Ripper (aka: Carles Allen Lechmere (Cross)) struck in the Autumn of 1888...not 1889.

He was a car man (meat deliverer from the butchers). He was found with Polly Nichols just minutes after her murder, gave the police a false last name, had an upbringing similar to modern day serial killers and all the killings were on the route to and from his home/work during the morning hours of his walks.
