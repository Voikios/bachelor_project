mastinon,It is only shocking if you slept through the past decade
PaleBlueDave,"The 'truth' he posted on his Twitter knock off:

>Remember in Helsinki when a 3rd rate reporter asked me, essentially, who I trusted more, President Putin of Russia, or our “Intelligence” lowlifes. My instinct at the time was that we had really bad people in the form of James Comey, McCabe (whose wife was being helped out by Crooked Hillary while Crooked was under investigation!), Brennan, Peter Strzok (whose wife is at the SEC) & his lover, Lisa Page. Now add McGonigal & other slime to the list. Who would you choose, Putin or these Misfits?

He is relitigating something from 4 years ago because he is still butt hurt about having to walk back his comments."
trongzoon,He’s a traitor. Give him a media blackout until the DOJ charges the bastard
-November15th-,I can’t believe we’re going to have to listen to this dumbass until he dies.
DashCat9,Hey Republicans!  Perfect opportunity to finally ditch this guy!  Oh.....you're also owned by Moscow.  That's sad.
Mo0kish,"He's a putin sucking traitor.

Not so shocking."
doowgad1,"Shocking to who?

He disrespected POWs and veterans in general dozens of times.

He's always loved his Russian bankers over any American."
AtomicBlastCandy,I wonder how many international assets have died because of this fuck
ObligatoryOption,Russian asset trusts Russia over America.
MarketingFilms,This isn't shocking to anyone who paid *any* attention to his tenure.
muddlehead,"Imho his comment about trusting Putes over FBI in Helsinki was the most shocking thing he did - until of course leading a coup attempt. But, oh well, no one cares about either."
Tribalbob,"I feel like at this point, Trump could say ""If elected, I will literally hand the country over to Putin"" and GOP be all: ""Got my vote, #AnythingButBiden, #RidinWithTrump, #BidenIsaTraitor"""
rbremer50,I keep saying that the real danger to our constitution and our country comes from Trump’s supporters.  He is merely a focus agent for them - if he disappeared tomorrow they would find another one.  The entire Republican Party has become an organized force for treason.  If our nation is going to survive as a constitutional democracy the Republican Party must be rooted out and tossed in the garbage heap of history.
Wings81,Didn't he say that like five years ago?
Korgoth420,How can people NOT see that he is a Russian pawn?
sharingsilently,"So, even the Russians confirm Trump is a Russian Asset. He is a Traitor. Stop broadcasting stories about him. It only supports his and Putin’s interests.

Edit: spelling"
sugar_addict002,He is a criminal and a traitor.  Yet he walks around free.
raysma,He's a Putin supporter as was quite obvious during his horrible tenure in the Oval Office.  The gods forbid he should ever gain the highest office again - he'd find ways to stop supporting Ukraine and to give us over to Vlad.
oldcreaker,Trump has incessantly made it clear he won't tolerate intelligence.
Milozdad,We still haven’t learnt what Trump said to Putin in his two hour closed meeting in Helsinki. Probably promised to pull US out of NATO.
spuddy-mcporkchop,"The US ‘intelligence lowlifes’ wouldn't support his coup but putin would, that's the difference 😂 he's a despot wannabe, putin fanboy, man child dreaming of dictatorship"
TintedApostle,"wasn't this obvious...

edukated4lyfe,"Not shocking at all. This guy was going to pull us out of NATO across Eastern Europe. 

He is Putin’s lap dog"
Alternative-Flan2869,Sure sounds like a russian asset doesn’t it.
DropaDuced,Donald Trump hates The United States.
kayak_enjoyer,"Putin's not going to sleep with you, Donald."
FreakerzBall,He is so in Putin's pocket. What a treasonous fraud.
Screen-Of-Green,The only time Trump is capable of standing up to Putin is right after he gets off his knees.
NeoPrimitiveOasis,"Is anything ""shocking"" with this cretin?"
maddenmcfadden,Russian puppet loves Russia. I'm shocked  SHOCKED!
Seraphynas,"*checks source,…. just in case

Nope. Not The Onion.

🤦‍♀️"
cogitoergopwn,Can i post F merrick garland for every 2023 trump article that gets posted? This derelict stooge has let this cancer fester in our politics. It’s infuriating
piles_of_anger,"Go to jail already, shit loaf."
bluemew1234,"> (whose wife was being helped out by Crooked Hillary while Crooked was under investigation!)

$1 says Trump has gaslight himself into thinking Crooked is her real first name!

Any takers?"
Frankenmuppet,"Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the former President of the United States"
Special_FX_B,Shocking? Perhaps to someone stranded on a desert island for over 6 years. He made it unequivocally clear many times that he is on Team Putin. Silly headline.
guntherbumpass,70 million people like this moron.
TheBigPhilbowski,"""You see,"" my colleague went on, ""one doesn’t see exactly where or how to move. Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.

""Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, ‘everyone’ is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, ‘It’s not so bad’ or ‘You’re seeing things’ or ‘You’re an alarmist.’

""And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.

""But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.

""But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.

""And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.

IveChosenANameAgain,Fat traitor treasons again.  Amazing!
ZumaThaShiba,He loves his Daddy
Raging-Bool,"Just a reminder of who is the largest shareholder in the once-respectable Independent - Evgeny Lebedev - member of UK's House of Lords for whatever reason (Thanks Boris, not suspicious at all), and son of sanctioned former KGB officer Alexander Lebedev."
nubyplays,This is only shocking if you haven't been paying attention. Trump and most of the GOP are at the stage of flaunting how compromised they are on Russia.
houstonyoureaproblem,"Shocking?

Only if you haven't paid any attention at all for the last 7+ years.

The man is a traitor."
pattydickens,Does anyone besides Trump trust Putin? Honest question.
postman925,He literally owes his entire fortune and sham of a political career to Putin. Not shocking at all.
SCMtnGuy,Why is this shocking? He's been saying similar for years.
Healthy_Jackfruit_88,This isn’t shocking if you remember what he said about Putin while he was in office. He basically said they were “friends with benefits”
BeneficEvil,Only shocking if you haven't been paying attention for the last 6 years
Thetimmybaby,Not *that* shocking if you've been paying attention
DemiMini,That's not shocking. That's just monday. He's just getting rolling
Specialist-Lion-8135,How many ways does this libelous creep have to tell us he’s a traitor before someone puts him in prison for sedition and his thousand other egregious crimes against humanity?
tashurcam,"It amazes me that treasonous Trump, the biggest enemy & traitor to the United States in its history is still able to walk about us and trash talk this country. What will it take to end this reign of terror brought on by such a jackass. He was correct when he said he could gun down someone in the middle of Fifth Ave & get away with it cause it's more or less what he's doing now. Anyone else would be in jail right now. The longer you let him get away with these terrorist acts, the more brazen he becomes. All government officials take an oath to protect this country from all enemies foreign and domestic. Well you've all failed your oath by allowing this domestic enemy run free."
around_the_catch,"Trump's supporters could not care less that he is a lying, criminal, hypocrite with no backbone.

They only care that he would insure a white, Christian America where white people have the best jobs and come first in society."
liv2kik,He is a Russian agent
RationalTranscendent,"Even if I thought that, say, Comey was incompetent and lacking in judgment, if it came down to whether to trust him or Vladimir Fucking Putin, I’m on team Comey."
outer_fucking_space,What percentage of trump supporters do you guys think wouldn’t abandon him even if he killed and ate a baby? 25%? 30%?
Bagz402,Lmao he literally didn't need to say this but here we are I guess. It was one of the bigger shitshows of his presidency too.
new-6reddit9,We are now getting report that FBI in New York had connections to Russia during Trump running for president and Miss formation report May cost Hillary the presidency - if this is not treason by FBI Trump sympatizer then we have a huge problem

Looks like the best investment Russia can buy. 

When will the US be the next Russian federal territory?"
JosephStrider,"Republicans: “well…I guess I’m pro Russia, anti America now….”"
Floss_tycoon,"Simple, Putin helped him and the others hurt him therefore Putin's truthful and the others are liars. Narcissist logic. Trump thinks like a 2 year old."
Poococktail,Hilary was so right
cyber_billy45899,He's an enemy of the United States and every religious wacko right wing kook Republican wants him in charge of the US military.
Tristain7,"It's slightly less shocking than the other 40 times he's said he trusts Russia more than America... and less shocking still than the fact that millions of people can look at this man and think ""Yup, he's the one I want to follow""."
BlotchComics,"Whoever says the nicest things about him is the one telling the truth.

Any criticism of him is obviously a lie."
spillinator,It's not shocking.
Remarkable_Map_5111,The Russian asset acting like a Russian asset isn't shocking.

TimeVersusSpace,Yeah he said that in like 2017 too
Accurate_Zombie_121,Trump works for Putin. What else could he say?
cavalier_54,Is it shocking though? Did he not do this when he was president too? Is he not a traitorous piece of shit?
HolyErr0r,They forgot the quotes. “Shocking”
Skastrik,"I think this may actually be the thing that sinks him. People have very much established that Russia led by Putin are ""the bad guys"". Trump going against that trying to change the narrative is going to turn a lot of his supporters and donors away from him."
DerekStu,"If you still think this guy is presidential material, you need your head examined."
pomod,Someone ELI5 how this clown hasn’t been charged for any of his out in the open felonies yet?
Canuckpunk,Trump is at odds with intelligence in any capacity.

AnohtosAmerikanos,"Donald Trump is a stupid bigoted narcissistic scourge on our country, and as such, should never get a single moment of media coverage except for one of his several upcoming criminal or civil trials. I wish nothing but ill for him."
TempleDev,"If I ever wanted to know what Putin’s dick tastes like, I know exactly who to ask"
Shaqtothefuture,This should be shocking to zero people with an exception of anyone living under a rock for the last decade. Trump’s oligarchical ties date back to at least the 80’s and they have been written and documented extensively from countless sources.
lasttosseroni,"Follow the money. He’s not doing this for free.

Lock him up. Do not make another Nixon mistake.

And don’t forget about Kushner."
honeybadger3920,"Him and the GOP are corrupt agents of Putin, they need to be silenced, charged and put in chains forever."
Athlete_Cautious,"Genuine question: I'm european and for decades it looked like to me USA was massively anti-russian. How and when did the conservatives managed to do a 180° and now seems to be really supportive of Russia ? When did it begin, was is done in a span of months, years ?

I know, Trump is far from speaking for all conservatives out there but he doesn't seems to be alone in this boat."
Horror_Ad_1587,Definitely he is a traitor to this country. We should force him to leave
StanDaMan1,"This is Shocking?

We know he’s bought and paid for. We know he tried to extort Zelenskyy for falsified evidence against Joe and Hunter Biden. We know even the Republicans have said that he’s owned by Russia.

This isn’t shocking. It’s just exhausting that people continue to pretend that he didn’t ignore the barrel and start digging from the getgo."
pops_boozer24,How he is allowed to put in another bid for the presidency is still a total mind blow.
mettiusfufettius,"I mean, of course. His own intelligence agencies tell him what they believe to be the truth and Putin, a foreign intelligence agent, tells him everything he wants to hear true or not."
Particular-Ad-3411,"Honestly the more dumb shit like this he spews, the more likely is the GOP and other Politicians are going to willing to support (which is great). Literally majority of the DC Politicans and American Citizens (Global Allies) support Ukraine and see Putin’s error. 

He’s really not going to get any votes that will help him gain the majority to win. I mean granted he has a cult of millions of ignorant and belligerently racist followers, but  those numbers are in the low millions, most republicans are likely to vote for a sane GOP candidate backed by the party and not some fucker who at every turn is ready to give Putin a rim job and willingly bend over to get fucked in the ass by Putin. 

Honestly politicians have started to use fear mongering, hate rhetoric, and inaccurate views and reasons towards issues; along with name calling thier opponents. They don’t even provide reasonable methods towards action, it’s just them riling people up to have animosity towards the opposition… 

These fucker don’t do shit in office all they know how to do is make ignorant comments and spread lies towards important issues… Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert, Marjorie Taylor Greene, George Santos… (along with others). They only have their positions in office due to getting votes by lying their ass off, nor do they understand policies and bill they tweet about…

It’s funny as hell to see them misinterpret shit on twitter thinking themselves as saviors, when in reality the can’t even comprehend what they’re reading, until are corrected…."
The_Blendernaut,The only thing shocking here is the fact that my fellow Americans are still willing to support this traitor.
GoLightLady,Yep. Nope. Not taking advice from a lifelong grifter. Not once.
escargeaux,He's always been a Russian asset and we've said it from the beginning. The GOP worships Russia.
captaincanada84,Not really shocking if you understand he's a Russian asset.
Caledonian_kid,"He bigs up Putin because he wants to be the American version of him.

He's a narcissistic lunatic."
ShitStainWilly,"How does anyone, despite how stupid they may be, worship this traitor and consider themselves a patriot?"
InevitableAvalanche,"In any sane society, this would disqualify him. Not for conservatives though. Completely brainwashed at almost a North Korean level."
JMeers0170,"tRump is the worst example of a president the US has ever had. I’m truly embarrassed that he earned that title. He’s the biggest sack of shit in a bad suit walking the land. He deserves zero respect, zero trust, and zero air time. 

He absolutely does deserve is a change of outfit. An orange onesie with a number on it…..and not 45, either.  Additionally, a new living accommodation is in order with dimensions somewhere around 6ft x 10ft."
TonyWrocks,"How is it shocking that Trump panders to Russian propaganda?

Trump has been a Russian asset from the moment Trump Tower Moscow was first discussed in 2013"
AceVetoKing,He is a traitor. And people who support him are unamerican
LandosMustache,"I don’t see how this is shocking in any way, shape, or form.

Trump has REPEATEDLY sided with Putin against the United States, even/especially when he, Trump, was IN FUCKING CHARGE of the United States. Trump has been screaming from the rooftops his admiration for Putin for a long long time.

It’s fucking insane that we had a President who acted directly and deliberately on behalf of Russia and Putin, but we did. Trump *talking* about trusting Putin is like the *least* shocking thing he’s done re: Russia."
Tony_Stark_0,"\*sucks dick of dictators like Putin and Kim Jong Un, nobody in the GOP says a goddamned thing about it\*

The whole fucking Republican Party, with a very few exceptions, are **fucking traitors to the United States and should be thrown out of Congress and JAILED.**"
CountrySax,Traitor Trump never misses an opportunity to kiss his boss' ass
WildlingViking,"Trump is on Putin’s payroll. I don’t see how we as a country can let this continue. Him and others are literally selling us all out and placing their own greed over and above our personal and national safety. C’mon maga, wake the hell up! 

There’s a reason trump holds onto his financial records like there the last cheeseburger of the day at McDonald’s."
dbolg22,Dudes a fucking idiot and I am ashamed we elected him.
TurokHunterOfDinos,"Sad that he feels entitled to shit on his own people to excuse his traitorous relations with Russia.  

While his dimwitted sycophants may let him off, history, and hopefully the DOJ, will not."
RockingRocker,Republicans who support this guy are traitors.
BraveOmeter,"Hey MAGA, look at how great America was under Trump. So great we trusted Russia's autocrat over America's intelligence agencies hired by and reporting to Trump."
Imacatdoincatstuff,He pays better.
RamonaQ-JunieB,Shameful. He has no shame.
Grimm2020,"Is it clear yet to where his allegiances lie?

hint: *it's not where you would hope or think...*"
ranchoparksteve,A second Trump term would be redundant. It would be a daily defense of something that happened six years ago.
linoleum79,Ya.... so shocked. No one could have seen that coming... again.
RecognitionOne395,Somebody please lock fat Donald Dumpling up.
SpaghettiSandwich,Didn't Trump just make comments the other week about how Putin and China are going to nuke us or something? Must have had a talking-to.
schu4KSU,He doesn't care about winning the primary. He's circling the wagons around his cavalcade of morons and will hold the GOP hostage in the general election if he's not paid/pardoned.
GiftedOaks,It's not  weird considering most of the intelligence Putin got was from Trump
bodyworks,Alternate title: trump sucks off his Russian handler once again.
No-Owl9201,"Trump doesn't care for the Constitution, laws, or elections, he just wants to be America's Putin.."

tuffpaws,"If this man hates so many agencies of the government, why exactly is he running for president?

Oh, I forgot. It's literally the Republican's dream to destroy the federal government."
NachoWindows,Of course he’d trust his boss over US intelligence
KilroyLeges,"It’s only shocking that a former POTUS, or candidate, would say such things. For Trump to say it again is not shocking. We know he’s an asshole with Putin’s hand up said asshole."
MidSp,"Not really that shocking.

If you haven't figured out which side Trump is on by now, I don't know what to tell ya."
TheseLipsSinkShips,"The US Intelligence lowlifes used to be on America’s side…, until Pompao and Flynn…"

Um…weren’t the vast majority of these people no longer employed by the government by the time of the Trump/Putin press conference in question? (Not sure what the footnote about Mrs. Strzok being an SEC employee has to do with anything. A government employee, yes, but working out of a very different wheelhouse)."

[Trumps lie count - Washington post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/24/trumps-false-or-misleading-claims-total-30573-over-four-years/)

He also called everyone who died defending our country ""losers"" and ""suckers"".

And here he says he trusts Putin - arguably one of the greatest threats to freedom and liberty in the world - over the entire US intelligence community.

It's clear to me who the loser and sucker is.  Trump and those who still believe in him."
Spin_Quarkette,"Yesterday he trashes the military, and today he trashes the IC, claiming he trusts Putin more. Does anyone need more evidence that this guy is a serious threat to the country?  I certainly hope Georgia does all of us a favor and throws him in prison."
BrownEggs93,"Remember, he still speaks for the republican party no matter how hard they might try and pretend otherwise.  This bastard needs to be in prison."
staiano,Shocking to who?  The right wants this and the left knows he will say it to stir his base.
StoneheartedLady,"This should be ""Trump continues to make"" seeing as he's been saying the same thing for years."
Di20,"This dude is looking for an exit ramp, so he can avoid jail time."
rexmorgany,"If he doesn’t trust the US intelligence community, why did he keep so many of their top secret documents after being evicted from the White House?"
skeeter04,The most dangerous man in the USA.
Pascalwbb,"so these ""patriots"" are so proud of their country that they believe the enemy more. Lol."
Lynda73,Why is this shocking? This isn’t even the first time he’s said this.
Teenager_Simon,Why won't Republicans just move to Russia to own the libs?
socokid,"Uh, he did that in Helsinki many years ago, [on a world wide stage.](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/16/trump-russia-putin-summit-722418) 

> “I have President Putin, he just said it’s not Russia,” 

The man could not care less about America. He only cares about Donald. Period."
CrystalJizzDispenser,"Imagine being dumb enough that'd you'd listen to this complete clown and take anything he says seriously.

The guy is an absolute fucking moron."
dae_giovanni,"""shocking"" only if you've been in a coma for the past handful of years..."
Intelligent_Ad_7797,And those moron supporters of his genuinely think he would have stopped putin from attacking the Ukraine
UncertainlyUnfunny,"Wagner Group has a commercial out… recruiting J6ers… to go to Russia… to fight Ukraine.

I have no problem with it: two birds, one stone.

GlenAllen_2010,"The dude is sick in the head, and frankly so is anyone that supports him. Does anyone really want a Dictator running this country? I am a Democrat, but I do believe in some Republican policies, and I use to support some Congressional Republicans, but no more. The Republicans will have a landslide loss in 2024. Unless Trump dies or goes to prison, I see no way out for them, but you know what? They put themselves here!"
Cool-County-5696,One day hopefully soon Trump will be gone but his 33% to 40% will still be around and that is why we are the most disgusting population in a major country that is still a democracy.
RickTracee,"Would you expect anything less from a TRAITOR?

What is the difference between Donald Trump and Benedict Arnold?

Benedict Arnold was a hero during the American Revolutionary War but felt he never received the recognition he thought he deserved. In turn, he became a TRAITOR and defected to the British Army.

Donald Trump had 5 draft deferments to avoid military service during the Vietnam war. In addition, he has stolen top secret documents and led an insurrection against the USA. Trump is just a TRAITOR who has never served the US honorably."
