Pheonix-Mage,"whatever you do, never connect it to the internet, it'll get a case of the ""new genesis wave"""
Cleave-The-Cross,"Takes me back to the first Gears of War. Nothing like chainsawing some locust in half

Edit: You beautiful nostalgic people just made my morning, and my month. I just wanna say ""DOM!!! GET ON THAT TROIKA!!!"""
Armandonerd,I miss this
mypantsrblue,This is hackable if you don’t update it and likely worth money on eBay because of it. Google what dashboard you have and see if it’s exploitable and if so: $$
existonfilenerf,"Makes me want to play Geometry Wars, damn."
neoyoc,That's rad and all but how bout that 250 lb tv. What a beauty!
Kozzinator,Jebus Christ you've found a portal to another time. What games were on it?
KingCarbon1807,"Echoes of a better world, long past."
WittyUnwittingly,"It may be possible to JTAG this with only software, in order to play homebrew.

You can RGH any 360, but some of the old phats that don't have some specific fuses blown on the board (It's been quite a while, I may not be recounting all the details perfectly accurately) are vulnerable to a software exploit that will allow you to run unsigned code.

EDIT: Not software only."
TastefulTexas,Also on a side note peep my 1080i sony trinitron 😍😍😍
JimEDimone,That was the superior dashboard. Don't know what genius decided to update it.
Relevant-Distance886,The blades were hands down the best dashboard
MakashiBlade,Core memory unlocked. Awesome find!
2muchparty,"Ah yeah reminds me of the wifi adaptor and using my debit card to finally buy a year of Xbox live to jump on ghost recon…

I miss the green rotating gui on the first first xbox"
redconvict,"I bought mine at the tail end of this dasboards existance. Not long after I played with it they just got rid of it. Its also the console I always had some kind of problems with. Discs would get torn up, the RROD would appear for various reasons. Not one 360 managed to work as long as any other consoles, even my first ever PS1 has managed to outlive them all no problem. I had so much fun playing Oblivion, Dead Rising, Red Dead, Halo 3 and many others. The controller is still my number 1 go to controller. But man, these things were not built to last."
blackjesus75,"Gears of war co-op?
Halo 3 co-op? 

Some of the best nights of gaming."
Particle_Thrower,This was and will always be my favorite 360 dashboard. I was so bummed out when they changed it.

divinegalacticz,Dont update it. That is worth bank to a j-tagger
davidii907,That’s the best dash board to date
wesg89,Can’t believe Microsoft has not made dashboards a micro transactions cause that blade baseboard would sell for 25$ easy
SilentResident1037,Imagine seeing a white 360 that still works...
Burnsie92,I remember how you could hook an mp3 player up to it and play your music in the game audio.
Pikachu_smokes_darts,Wowwww. Never connect this to the internet. Also if you want some $ these go for a good price on eBay.
Civil-Lingonberry624,Do not connect this to the internet. It must be protected at all costs

M0rningVodka,"Can you share when you get the Red ring of death?
Some of my fondest memories."
existentialg,Whatever you do don’t update it!
WhiteLightningLuna,Oh fuck yeah the nostalgia
Dragon_yum,Blades are to this day the best Xbox dashboard
MaximumEffort433,"The older I get the more I appreciate a nice, clean, simple UI.  
  
Or maybe I'm just running into more mean, gross, complicated UIs.  
  
Or both.  It's probably both."
D3dshotCalamity,"I faked being sick so I could stay home from school to download the update after this one, I think it was called NXE."
AverageMale255,Ahhh the nostalgia 🥹
codyj6490,JTag this bish
helo323,Hey you got that HD-DVD player!
Handlebar_Therapy,"Ah, man. I remember thinking the ""Open Tray"" was revolutionary even though you still had to get off the couch to swap games. 

I miss being able to just pop in a new game and play it instantly without installing it."
Darth_Ra,"Does this mean you have Marble Blast Ultra, as well?"
Xeon713,Ah thing of beauty that! I miss that and the update after. The tiles wreck me.
Kwiatkowski,"What’s what mine looks like still, hasn’t been connected to live ever I think"
GlitchyReal,"Me, having not played the 360 since high school when I had no internet, I feel weird that this doesn't look weird."
Microtic,I still have the same Xbox Profile picture from way back when I set it up on this version of the Xbox 360 OS. It's a blurry square on my Xbox Series X. 😂

gongshoweric,Did that ghetto ass TV come with it?
Waxitron,"I think that everything since this looks pretty, but isn't nearly as functional."
LemonproX,The widescreen CRT is a gem too
Stevieo101,"Wow, memory unlocked. 

I remember when I got my first xbox 360 I was just old enough to have saved up enough money to buy my first ever console. I was also like 11 so it was big for me. Of course because it just my piggy bank savings all I was able to get was the Xbox 360 version with no hard drive, and the only game I got was Oblivion. 

I was so excited to get home and play only to quickly realize that without my hard drive there was no chance I was able to fully enjoy the massive RPG that was Oblivion. After replaying that opening sewer mission about 15 times every time I booted the game up I just resorted to leaving my xbox on for a day until my dad got me a hard drive that way I can truly enjoy my first big purhcase. 

360 holds special spot in my heart"
theuserwithoutaname,#***IT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM***
RobLocke,Core memory unlocked
KobotTheRobot,Be careful what game you out in it. The game discs also contained updated firmware.
mistermatt2u,The TV came with it? NICE.
bionikcobra,"Lol, I still have a fist gen OG Xbox, works perfectly and untouched, considering it went through 2yrs in Fallujah... I'm pretty impressed with it and I refuse to sell it. Lol, I've sold everything else sans a controller and a few games.

The reason your 360 still works is probably because it was never updated."
ScampersInATuxedo,"Dear Microsoft.

Take this UI.

Polish it up.

Release it.

&#x200B;

And never, ever fucking ruin it again, you blithering idiots."

wildhorn0,*”you’re as beautiful as the day I lost you…”*
_staymello,seems to be around the same year that TV was made. what a time.
No_Interaction_4925,"Xbox 360 UI > Xbone UI > Dogshit current UI, change my mind. Currently confusing and terrible for younger generation to navigate at all."
PM_ME_YOUR__THIGHS,This radiates Halo 3

SPAZZEH,ps2/xbox era - 2010 was the golden era of gaming.
