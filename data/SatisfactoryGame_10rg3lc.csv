Cultural_Set_7129,"800m is Just the average conveyor length. I dont Trust vehicles.

In my current Game i only rely to drones as Transport Option beside conveyors. Energy hungry but lovely and easy to Setup after you got a proper battery production :)"
Druggedhippo,"Vehicles might make sense if there was finite resources, or conveyors had some kind of drawback that encouraged minimizing their use like an energy cost per segment.

But since neither of those two things are relevant right now, multi level conveyors are the best option."
TrueMechTech,Idk I think trucks are bad because fuel must be supplied
PsychologicalTowel79,I'm loath to set up a long conveyor.
crappy-mods,Long conveyors don’t mess up
chrimminimalistic,"800? Pfftttt. My longest was like 10km.

Kidding. It's just nearly 3km."
totally_unbiased,"Conveyors are almost always faster and easier, but trucks are also very reliable and satisfying. They just need foundations in most biomes because they're terrible at hills.

People worry about fuel but the reality is 90% of the places you want to run trucks have local coal. I have like 15 truck routes, am adding more, and only a single one doesn't run on locally available coal. I swear I've built multiple garage setups out only to realize when I started thinking about fuel that there was a coal node like 100m away. I built a whole turbofuel distribution setup and it essentially does almost nothing."
Commander_Crispy,One word… *pylons*
BoatMan01,"Tractors are easier than they seem. One 3 min tutorial video later and my factory expanded by about a kilometer. 

Stealing this meme."
Bubbaganewsh,"I see a resource node over a km away and my thought is ""That's not that far at all for a conveyor"""
PinothyJ,"Rail system is so much fun to set up! Hire me, I will do it for you :D."
espiritu_p,"I started building a 1500m conveyor belt to the nearest Quartz mines before researching vehicles. The biggest issue was the cliff I had to climb up because I of course choose the shortest way possible.

No way I will ever turn it down and replace it by vehicle. But my next mine will be connected with those robot- cars."
Kangzx,"I like trucks. I think they are neat.

Packing fluids is a bit of a headache though. Currently do it just to ""roleplay"", would prefer a way to recycle canisters"
timmah612,"Dont forget the part where you build it on top of a 4 or 5 stack of stackable conveyor poles, ""because i might need vehicles to come through this way eventually""  fully knowing youre going to stay with using conveyors the whole time"

Mallardguy5675322,"The only good vehicle is trains. And I’m far too lazy to do a full circle line or build them too much because:


1: I hate it when structures float(First rule of Minecraft is don’t leave trees floating.) 


2: because of subject #1, I feel the need to make a realistically supported bridge, so therefore, bridge support towers.


3:I build bridges because rail building is wonky as fuck and building in a straight line up, down, or flat is better than snaking on the ground.


4: It took me 50 hours to do the first bridge, 
granted that was my first time, and I was traveling from The Dunes to the Grassy Plateaus. My nuclear waste line took 40 hours to make, it went from Swamp ocean to Tall red trees to the the top left corner of the map. 


5: Bridge 1 took approximately 5 industrial storage crates of each concrete and plates to make. Bridge 2 took 7 industrial storage crates. 


6: For my project parts 4 base, most of my resources came from conveyor belts. (mk5 of course). For 8 turbo motors per min(quite proud of that for first play-through) it took me 36 hours to set up all the conveyor lines for the ore. And in total, about 40 hours on the project. 


7:I’d rather not spend 40 hours on a bridge, 
when I’d rather use that time to make a actually good factory. 


8: as for trucks, trains are superior.


9:as for drones, they are awesome, but I’m not making a battery factory for every single region on the map I have a big base on. (That being 6 with 25 satellite bases). 


9: And that’s why Conveyor belts are the superior mode of transport. 


10: conveyor belts are ugly as fuck and that’s points off. It’s way cleaner with vehicles.

Edit bonus:
The longest track I’ve made in a straight line is 1,900 meters. Northern most quartz node all the way to the red forest."
Oldenodd,"""WTF is this guy doing?""

You don't clean your brain after a night in the internet? Ewww."
GaffJuran,The only vehicles that don’t get held up but the slightest imperfection in the landscape are trains and drones.
PyroYeet0808,"I set up resources for a 2100 uranium/min power plant that sinks all waste to plutonium rods and after setting up everything, I turned on some awesome sinks to test all the drone ports before starting the MASSIVE production lines, turns out they were hard bottlenecked… I now have to AT LEAST double all drone ports"
KajMak64Bit,"What is the guy doing?
>Brainwashing"
Kaepora25,"Honestly, use conveyor until you unlock trains. Vehicles are just an absolute pain in the ass."
ziemniak2,I have 2 km conveyors in my factory
vincent2057,"Vehicles work. 
I have 3 in my most recent reactor setup transporting multiple items in each. Only short in fairness but good enough. 
You can just use coal to fuel them. It doesn't have to be anything fancy. 
I do also have 1 I've had the entire game transporting  caterium bars."
Stickel,This is me
56Bot,Me with 51km of conveyors at Tier 4 :
Razorray21,"i really only used vehicles for small things long distance. mostly pipes and Packaged heavy oil for my weapons factory, with a tractor. 

Never got into trains because i never needed that much throughput."
cyferhax,"My dude, I have several 3KM long belts.  I too do not like setting up vehicles.  

Now, that loooooong boy, its my aluminum production, so it just sends the ingots to my main base for finishing.  Most of the work is done by the nodes.

I mean, if I wanna play with vehicles I'll fire up Railroad Tycoon or something ;)"
ibbolia,Not me using trucks to set up conveyor belts over longer distances
Kalron,Yeah y'all should see my steel factory I built.  I brought in so many resources from 1km away using belts. It was toxic. Looks great tho
wawoodworth,"In my game, all resources come to ME, belt lengths be damned"
paleo2002,"The few times I've experimented with truck routes, they eventually end up missing a turn or route node and get stuck on some environmental feature.  I'd have to build them their own enclosed roadways . . . at which point I might as well wait and spend the time on actual train tracks."
Invertdoctopus,I also love watching real fast conveyors whip those materials through. Nothing like standing somewhere watching the approaching materials on several conveyors side by side. Love it.
Commissarfluffybutt,"Meanwhile I have tractors, trucks, and trains delivering stuff **IN** my factory."
TheGoodEnoughMother,"Disappointed in myself that I thought this was a real photo at first and thought, “Htf is he doing that?!”"
ZumboPrime,"I tried setting up a truck route. The very first attempt at recording the route ended after about a minute when the truck yeeted itself into the ocean off a flat bridge for no reason whatsoever.

I stopped trying to run trucks after that."
factoid_,"800 isn't bad.  I don't put vehicles in play until it's over 1km.  And even then it has to be a run that I'm certain will be worth the hassle.  Otherwise setting up conveyors is just plain better. 

Where trains really pay off is when you have either a high quantity or high diversity of items that need to be shipped around the map to different bases.  Then you can really benefit from setting up a track one time and just adding cars and trains for all the different stuff you need to move around."
Dianwei32,"I almost had to lay down a 3km pipeline because I forgot to check the location of a resource before I started building the factory. I'm playing with the Refined Power mod and wanted to try out the modular Reactors that it has alongside standard nuclear power. It uses some custom resources (Thorium and Deanium), but I forgot to check where the nearest Deanium was when I chose the spot to build the factory. Turned out it was 3km away. I also discovered that you can't package/unpackage Deanium, so I couldn't transport it with drones. 

Thankfully, I was able to find a Fluid Teleporter mod that let me just plop down an input at the well and an output in the factory. I generally don't like teleporter/big cheat mods... But I made an exception for this one case."
EidolonRook,"I get it. I really do. However I set up rails this past time and I’m in love. It’s amazing. I want more and more things to move by rails. Even with the convenience of drones, I don’t like how they lag and bounce."
KlaVra1,"No kidding we have our hub on the beaches near the waterfall in green hills and we needed a big space for our 200 fuel generators, so I went to the spire by a gigantic sky bridge and made a system where you drop items on the industrial container in the hub, and a belt takes it from the sandy beaches to the other complete side of the map... It's ENOrmous"
juberish,"I just have a network of conveyors scores the whole map lol - two going each direction, connecting each main base"
Blommefeldt,Rinse and repeat
wolfe_br,"I recall one of my conveyor belts going as far as 2km from my base, properly organized in small towers similar to power transmission lines. Not optimal, sure, but it's fully automated, doesn't require messing around with collecting biofuel (I just started Oil, so that might change) and specially no worries about setting up routes inside florest.

That being said, I plan on replacing all that stuff with monorail as soon as I get there lol"
nicolino01,"I'm awaiting 1.0 to see if vehicles will be easier to work with. And roads, we need roads"
Vancity_turtle,"Im building a biome factory right now. Biome.  


It covers the ENTIRE grasslands area...  


It's getting insane. So far iron is done. I am playing in creative mode but yeah...  


800m is nothing. Lmao."
Jrax02,"Oh yeah, i have a huge conveyor wall that stretches east to west"
Brick_Rage12,I'm the opposite. I'll set up train stations to go somewhere within eyesight from an observation tower 😅
Squirly888,Exactly me
ObjectMike,I feel like those of us doing long ass conveyors understand the flavor of the game more.
