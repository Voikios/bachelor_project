{"Title": "3D Streets from Tarkov map", "Post Text": "Hello! I just finished the first iteration of my 3D Streets of Tarkov map. You can find it [here.](https://www.re3mr.com/maps/Streets/re3mrStreetsofTarkov.png)\n\nI will keep working on it and replace the blockouts with detailed versions gradually. This should be a lot better than my blockout map I released prior to the patch release. \n\nPlease report errors or if there is something I should add or focus my attention on next.\n\nI hope you like it!", "ID": "107l4gv", "Score": 3086, "Total Comments": 229, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/107l4gv/3d_streets_from_tarkov_map/"}
