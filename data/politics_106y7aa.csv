YourUncleBuck,"Important takeaway from the article;

>the Justice Department wrote in a legal filing on Wednesday night that upholding the 8th Circuit's ruling would mean that ""banks could sue anyone who causes financial harm to their borrowers, credit-card companies could sue anyone who causes financial harm to their customers, and governments could sue anyone who causes financial harm to their taxpayers.""

>""Virtually all federal actions—from prosecuting crime to imposing taxes to managing property—have some incidental effects on state finances,"" it said. ""If such incidental effects suffice for standing, every State would have standing to challenge almost any federal policy."""
GabuEx,"Probably the most important bit to understanding this:

>Dalié Jiménez, a law professor at University of California Irvine and director of the Student Loan Law Initiative, told Insider that Biden's legal defense ""did a really good job in saying that if A causes financial harm to B, and B owes money to C, then C can sue... and that's bonkers.""

Basically, if the SCOTUS rules in the states' favor, then that means that anyone will have standing to sue anyone else if the latter's actions financially impact someone who owes money to the former.  If I lend you $100 and then someone fires you, I can take them to court to overturn the firing because they've made it harder for me to recoup my loaned money."
RandomLogicThough,Don't really have legal precedent when the SC can just onion cut whatever the fuck they want.
meltink745,"They say in the article - ""I do think that even if they end up holding this particular cancellation program to not be proper, that there are other ways that the administration can do this and should do this,"" she said.

What other ways does President Biden have to make this happen if the SC denies the forgiveness?"
Penwins,"What I don’t understand is what stops those with student loans from suing those who received PPP bailout loans?? 

Seems like there’s two sides of the coin here, but I’m obviously neither a lawyer nor a Republican."
OohIDontThinkSo,"For people who have been paying close attention to politics for a long time, is this the least respected Supreme Court in a long time? I know there have been justices who people heavily disliked or disagreed with but is this current group of judges the most corrupt at one time?"
mmmmyeahhlumberg,Who are we kidding? We'll have conservative SCOTUS decisions for the next 25 years. Probably the biggest Trump legacy.
AndySkibba,"The dumbest thing is MOHELA has come out and said it's Fed Govt debt, so MOHELA isn't even ""hurt"" by the forgiveness, so there's no standing."
sulaymanf,"I fear the conservative court wants to overturn the loan forgiveness; I have no doubt Clarence Thomas hates “lazy college students who should just work like I did to pay off loans in a single summer,” but will have a hard time finding a legal justification for it. John Roberts promised that judges are supposed to be neutral umpires between politics but nobody is buying that anymore."
DollyPartWithOn,1/5 or more cases this court hears will set a strange legal precedent.
Where_is_Tony,They have made it clear that legal precedent is fucking irrelevant now.
CuriouslyInept,We need to uncap the House and reload the court.
Eric_in_America,"The plaintiff's case is agenda driven and the supreme court's decision will undoubtedly be partisan in nature, there is precedent along with arguments to be made in favor of debt forgiveness, but a conservative court won't bother.

First off, understand that student loan debt is already factored into the national debt because the department of education borrows its money for student loans from the US Treasury, it's the establishment of student loans themselves that's added over a trillion dollars to the national debt. Basically, it won't bring about an economic crisis if we cancel student loan debt tomorrow. 

What's more, the DoE sort of functions as a bank, and a very large one at that. The department owns close to 1.5 trillion dollars in student debt, and the interest it collects from students far exceeds the U.S treasury's interest rates. The DoE takes the ""profit"" and uses it to pay for ""administrative costs"" and loan servicing through third party contractors, It's a bank...

If student loan debt were cancelled tomorrow (not all student loan debt falls under the umbrella of forgiveness), which most estimates put at around 400 billion dollars worth of debt, the government wouldn't immediately be out of hundreds of billions of dollars and wouldn't have to scramble to make up for it. 

If any argument could be made about the ""cost"" of this debt relief, it's the cost of lost revenue from borrowers paying back their loans with excessive interest rates attached, however, these payments have been suspended since the beginning of the pandemic. 

Biden can and probably will continue to extend this moratorium, which also points to his tangible executive powers and evidence that he may very well have the authority to cancel student loan debt.

For perspective, Trump's tax cut legislation, which never ""paid for itself"", gutted the corporate tax rate and only *temporarily* lowered taxes for individuals. It's been estimated that these tax cuts will cost upwards of $2 trillion dollars over time, comparatively more so than debt forgiveness.

Trump's tax cuts overhauled the tax code for the rich, cut government revenue heavily, and acted as deceptive ""trickle down"" policy, but now Republicans can claim that this money was ""injected into the economy"" when we all know by now that tax cuts for corporations and billionaires don't ""trickle down"", and those that benefitted most will continue to side step the American tax system while any small benefit to individual taxpayers was short lived for political purposes. 

Conservatives aren't up in arms over this, so called ""populists"" who would rather obsess over a fraction of what amounts to total costs and debts, of what amounts to nothing compared to the bailouts, subsidies and PPP loan forgiveness, the ""trickle down"" policies, the lost revenue, tax code changes and tax cuts for the wealthy that Republicans support. Bills and policies that invest in the rich, the corporations, donors, banks and not in younger generations of Americans, transfering wealth out of the hands of the poor and into the pockets of the rich, promoting profligacy and preserving an economy defined by its continuing crises, its growing wealth gap and its exploitative practices and customs.

Student debt relief wouldn't go towards perpetuating these things, it would go towards buying homes, starting families, paying for living expenses, it would go towards helping Americans and supporting the economy on a practical level. Analyses even suggest that it would boost real GDP.

*A 2018 analysis from the Levy Economics Institute estimated that student debt cancellation could boost real GDP by an average of $103bn to $130bn a year or $1.03tn to $1.3tn over 10 years*

Student loan debt repayments stifle consumer demand, forgiveness may actually contribute towards economic expansion and recovery, atleast to a more practical effect than things like Trump's tax cuts. Borrowers won't take their loan forgiveness and hide it offshore either.

Conservatives take great issue with student debt forgiveness but don't seem to take nearly as much issue with their tax money going towards perpetuating the real, broader economic problems. Republicans tend to staunchly oppose what benefits Americans at the expense of their rich donors and friends.

The ""cost"" of student loan debt relief represents a mere fraction of the cost of the government's total bill, a fraction of the objectionable costs that Republicans choose to fund or overlook, a fraction of the 40% increase in the national debt under Trump, Republicans only fixate on cost when it's politically advantageous for them. What's more, as I understand, if student debt relief goes through, the national debt would reflect what's owed to the treasury, not the cost of the loans. 

And it's a cost that bears no immediate impact on the national debt while being manageable overtime, but a cost no less that's breeding mass hysteria from conservatives who are blinded by their pre conceived ideas, their prejudices and the propaganda they consume.

These conservatives are either being disingenuous or ignorant when they complain of the ""tax burden"" that debt relief will inflict upon them. 

When the government suffers a cost or debt, it finds a way to compensate for it, usually in the form of tax increases, spending cuts or borrowed money, you won't be billed a lump sum for debt forgiveness, it doesn't work like that. Any tax increase you incur will be a result of a multitude of costs and debts, debt forgiveness will contribute scantily. It represents a fraction of costs and it's a debt ostensibly accounted for.

Even estimates from conservative advocacy groups suggest that most low to middle income Americans will hardly pay much at all. 

One figure being thrown around is just a half baked estimate conservatives came to by dividing the total cost of relief by the number of tax payers, while it's hardly ever mentioned that it's a cost incurred over ten years. 

The fact is, the cost would be negligible and not spread across the income spectrum, a relative cost, those with the highest incomes will incur the largest ""burdens"". One figure showed lower to middle income Americans paying something like 20 bucks a year. 

In the end, this isn't about conservative ""values"", it's about sticking it to the libs, it's about maintaining an anti-left strategy of obstruct at all costs. It's about coming to that conclusion first, that this must be stopped, and then seeing it through in any way conceivable. ""Executive overreach"" is a justification, a way to rationalize this obstructive agenda. Republicans only care about overreach when it's convenient for their narrative or agenda, overreach is more common for them than they'd care to admit, especially where it concerns their culture war. 

Is student loan debt cancellation a comprehensive solution to the deeper, more systemic problems? No, but it's a start, it's a way to acknowledge those problems, problems that didn't exist for a lot of these people who are vehemently opposed to debt relief, people who think ""if I can't have it, you can't either"" is a reasonable argument. These are people, who in some cases, helped give rise to these problems, or elected leaders who did, people who couldn't care less about what's best for younger generations of Americans, people who believe that the burden is on themselves, that they're the victims, when that burden has actually been on these younger generations, that's the whole point."
Modal_Window,Student loan forgiveness will be struck down because access to education would allow Americans opportunities. Corporations need people to be poor and desperate so that they accept minimum pay and unsafe working conditions and Republicans need them uneducated so they keep voting Rep.
xormybxo,So much work of future Supreme Court is going to be undoing the damage Roberts caused
shivaswrath,Wouldn't bankruptcy be struck down too then? Stands to reason the state suffers from this as well.
YourUncleBuck,Yahoo link to same article; https://www.yahoo.com/news/supreme-court-strikes-down-student-114500768.html
gerams76,The reality is that the SC has to let this one go. Accepting the loan companies' argument basically sets a legal precedent that any company that is hurt financially through policy changes can sue the government. This basically makes impossible to every pass any policy changes ever.
HappyGoPink,"""Legal precedent"" are words that have no meaning to the current Supreme Court. They have gone rogue, and they will never return to what we used to call legal precedent."
honestblackman,"And as long as student loan forgiveness stays paused, it can be used as a political stance in future elections. ""If you elect republicans to office, you'll have to repay that insurmountable debt.""

Every dem from here on should be using this point against any future republican candidates."
evansbott,Guess it’s a good thing they’ve already decided legal precedents don’t matter.
somguy9,"Man isn’t it weird that when a Republican is in office, the theory of the supreme executive reigns and the president can do whatever the fuck he wants - it’s legal because he’s the president - but then as soon as a Democrat gets in office we have to consult a séance with Thomas Jefferson’s corpse to make sure every fart let out in the Oval Office is constitutional?

If forgiving PPP loans is constitutional, then this is constitutional. Simple as that. Not that I expect Republicans to actually care about anything other than themselves."
GuitarGeezer,"As usual, this highlights that the US congress is absolutely incapable of passing any legislation giving us a sane and rational student loan system and it really never was. With almost every law for nearly twenty years being nothing better than a successful bribery attempt, any better outcome is logically impossible under any facts or circumstances. Only people who can afford over 250 congress members get the benefit of laws in America and that is as good and fair as we will ever be again. Voters love this, and if they don’t, there is no evidence of it."
whyreadthis2035,This has been the GOP plan for decades. They embrace these implications.
Sundae_Gurl,Biden should just declare student loans to be a national emergency and divert funds from the Pentagon to pay off the loans like Trump did with his wall. It's already been approved by SCOTUS.
Loreki,"There's only really one precedent being set by this court, which is that precedent doesn't matter."
sportsjorts,Fuck the Supreme Court.
Point_Forward,Im gonna sue the supreme court for damages

AvunNuva,"I guess if somebody can sue for not getting an equal amount as somebody who got pell grants, I should be able to stop corporations (who are treated as entities such as you and I) from getting hand outs.

Alternative-Flan2869,Trump and moscow mitch crippled our democracy by making these fascist autocratic scotus appointments.
A_Soft_Fart,Sure as fuck makes me trust politicians even *less* than I already do. Politicians have fallen short on promises before. But this is the first time I’ve essentially been told I have been given something just to have different politicians take it away.
Hymynameis25,Its just kinda weird that theyre up in arms fighting 10k (or 20k) in student relief. Theres people with 50k loans battling. Approving 10k will still have them owing 40k. Still cant understand why ppp loans are forgiven faster than a lil 10k
Substantial_Sun_8477,"So SC is saying government can bail out banks and auto companies, but not it’s (educated) citizens."
TheMightyPrince,"The view of America from someone living in the UK: The legal system is broken, the political system is broken, there are mass shootings and 6 year olds with guns, the health care system is broken, there is a massive drug problem. I am sure I am missing a few things."

JenJohnston97,What fascinates me about cases like this is the fundamental conflict between the power of the chief executive to direct an executive branch department vs. Congress’s power of the purse.
Cool-County-5696,"What could be a greater harm to federal revenue and the states which lose federal monies as a result then the Trump tax cut for the top top top
tier."
WalrusViking2,Who cares about legal precedent. The supreme court sure doesn't. They showed that clear as day when they struck down Roe v Wade. The Dems have to stop playing by the implied rules of government because the Republicans sure don't give a fuck.
spaitken,“Startling Implications” is the official motto of this SCOTUS
PullinUpBootstraps,If SCOTUS strikes down student loan forgiveness then every single outstanding PPP loan should be immediately called in for full payment by end of the week.
MagicalUnicornFart,"Expand the Court, bro. 

Or, force the Beer Guy rapist, the lady that lied under oath about repealing Roe, or the guy that supports treason, and sedition to resign, by investigating their bullshit. 

This is a religious extremist court. You can't act like they're legit without ""startling implications."" How many were appointed by a POTUS that was working for Putin?"
broll9,"I have a really good solution, cut the banks out of all future student loans. The government is within their power and is the lender anyway. The banks are loaned taxpayer money at 1% and then loan it to students at 6%.  If they want to cry poor mouth over taking a haircut on the total gift horse deal they are being given by the government, and the taxpayer, take away the deal. Cut the banks out of the student loan business and lend directly to the students a 3%. Problem solved and system run in the most efficient, cost effective manner."
Royal_Acanthisitta51,One of the few debts that that’s almost impossible to get discharged if you declare bankruptcy. Instead of dealing with the root of the problem of high tuition and low wages they created an abstract form of indentured servitude.
-CJF-,"Precedent isn't even the biggest concern because SCOTUS ignores it whenever it's convenient anyway. If precedent mattered to SCOTUS they would not have overridden Roe v. Wade with the Dobbs decision.

The bigger concern is the implications such a ruling would have for the integrity of the court. To put it mildly, this court is already not very popular with the American people and this lawsuit has no teeth. Such an unpopular ruling would have to be very clearly justified or it's going to cause even more people to lose faith in our justice system at a time when faith in the system is already very low.

* Many consider the court illegitimate because at least 2 of the 9 members that were appointed by republicans should've been appointed by democrats (Obama and Biden). Mitch McConnell and the GOP abused their majority to steal their appointments using hypocritical and conflicting justifications.
* There are many questions surrounding Clarence Thomas' wife's involvement in the events of January 6th and Thomas' failure to recuse himself from cases related to those incidents have damaged the integrity of the court.
* Although it's only been a short time, this court under a republican majority has a history of legislating from the bench, overriding precedents, and making rulings that are unpopular with the American people."
DealsDaddyy,"Hold the fuck up, so everybody if they strike down student loan forgiveness we sue against the PPP loan forgiveness given to the likes of Marjorie Taylor Greene, Joel Osteen, Tom fucking Brady, and every other rich person who got it"
givethegiftofstupid,"Such a huge push and fightis happening over this 20K to make people forget that it all should be forgiven. after months of back and forth, even if the 20K goes through, it will never likely happen again since sentiment for it will be exhausted..."
wholesome_capsicum,"""Precedent Shmecedent, how bout we do *anyway*""

Welcome to the GOP where the rules are made up and the votes don't matter"
_Magnolia_Fan_,Executive orders and supreme court rulings are not a substitute for a functioning legislative branch.
thistimelineisweird,"SCOTUS doesn't seem to care much about legal precedent these days. A liberal court in the future will do well to remember that when dealing with followup lawsuits.

Yes, I recognize that a liberal court may be a pipe dream and we will never actually see it. But maybe future people will."
SourDieselDoughnut,"Dear God man, screw the 10 to 20k forgiveness. Just settle on the line that stated interest will not accrue for minimum payments or greater. The vast majority are fine with paying back the loans, but the interest is what keeps family's paying for years and could be a substantial help if lifted.

Also, last line of the article mentioned ""other"" methods of forgiveness, what could those be?"
This_Buds_For_You_,"Republicans are lobbied by healthcare to create that reality. The wealthy 1% and corporations lobby government to make meaningful changes in their favor and then expect you to blame government while they laugh at everyone. Think about it, government is the only entity that stop the 1% and corporations, which is why they fought so hard to manipulate the electorate into believing government is bad and corporations along with wealthy are good. As long as we blame government the wealthy and corporations can maintain the status quo."
lionheart4k,The Supreme Court will say there was no basis to sue but still deem the forgiveness illegal
Jmanmyers,"I think the court could easily sidestep this by just saying  well this case is a one-time thing as they did with the bakery in CO refusing to make a cake for a gay couple. 

Either way, as someone who still is paying their student loans, I fully anticipate having to pay the full amount because of this court. I appreciate Biden trying, though."
LadyBogangles14,"Ironically if Biden just keeps student loans frozen it becomes a Pandora’s box for another administration.  No one will want to restart those. It will be a toxic issue 

Kick the can down the road"
helptheplanet,Only the rich gets gifts from the government. If this goes through someone needs to sue the GOP for giving away trillion dollar tax breaks to the rich. That burdons everyone else.
Explodedhamster,Then just cancel it anyway and tell the worthless SC to do something about it.
thefriendlycouple,"The current Supreme Court sees itself as our true masters.  Not elected but make all the final decisions about our lives and laws.  

Reform the Supreme Court."
Fearless-Temporary29,No discounts on the plantation.
TheToken_1,"My guess is that the forgiveness plan in its current state will be shutdown. Though I’ve yet to see anyone against the forgiveness offer a resolution. Also, the issue with student loans are 2 part.

The first is regarding people who currently have student loans.

And the second would be how student loans/paying for college going forward would work.

Only coming up with a fix for just one part is essentially pointless. Forgiving student loans for current borrowers and doing nothing going forward would end up causing people to borrow more because they’d think theirs would be forgiven also and schools probably would just increase prices anyway. And only fixing it going forward would leave everyone with student loans (that are truly hurting because of it) behind."
SmokeyDBear,But can’t they just do that thing like in 2000 where they made a shitty decision and then said it wasn’t a precedent?
Either_Operation7586,Seriously we need to rethink letting people who WANT to burn it ALL down being part of the group of people we vote in to make the most difficult and serious decisions there are when it comes to running OUR country. We really need to just overhaul the whole shebang!

DavidlikesPeace,"I'm not panicking. And I say this as someone who would benefit so, so much from $10,000 forgiveness. 

Silver linings are 1) young voters will be shocked with a very clear reason to vote Democrat, and 2) Democrats will see they need to do something about the contra Supreme Court.  

In the long run, if the court delegitimizes itself with corrupt case law, the Democrats will move left. Even centrists like Biden will accept that basic reforms such as ""packing"" the court are necessary to protect our democracy. And such reforms cannot happen soon enough. This is a court that no longer serves our republic, but throttles any progressive acts or legislation.

Yes. it will be a real shame to lose trust in such an integral part of the system. But that trust should have already been lost back in the Gore case. The Democrats simply weren't paying attention to its new politicized nature of the court, or as importantly, did not want to accept a crisis existed. Cases like this will make the problem impossible to ignore."
Lockjawmuddobber,"As a victim of FFELP fraud, I’ve watched people comment on this issue without understanding it for years. NPR’s Cory turner has done a better job covering this than anyone IMO. Those of us with FFELP loans on IDR plans have been victimized for years. Many of us have paid what we borrowed and owe more than we borrowed due to interest fraud. Many of our servicers like Navient never kept track of how many payments on the IDR plan it would take to pay off our loans. Many can’t get a payoff total of any accounting of payments in the late 90’s and early 00’s. And all of us have been excluded from the CARES act pause. 

Our loans are considered *private loans* when it comes to pausing student loans. But our loans are considered *student loans* when it comes to declaring bankruptcy."
ClicketyClackity,"Or….

Xaemyl,lol like this supreme court gives 2 fucking shits about legal precedence.

The Republicans in Congress have been content to let them… or rather, this is what they want. Similarly, Republican presidents have put in place the judges who are grabbing more and more power for themselves. Democrats so far have not put up nearly enough of a resistance, and it seems not too far off where the only resistance they can offer, if they finally choose to act, is simply nonacquiescence itself. That is, to strip the Supreme Court of the power they are claiming by outright ignoring their rulings.
