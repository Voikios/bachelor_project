mochiai,"BSG's customer service is non-existent, has been and probably will always be like this. Reason being, their stance is = don't play if you don't like it because we make enough money already. But we always return, don't we."
Niitroglycerine,"1800hrs and I feel you.

Every patch has added new barriers to prevent any enjoyment or success, my first wipe I hit level 46 ish, this wipe I'm at level 11 and starting to wonder why I am still playing

And it really isn't burnout, a lot of the barriers are the bugs, just slowly building up frustrations patch by patch, this patch its the audio, I could even take the rambo laser beam 1 shot scavs if I could fucking hear where they are coming from

 steam audio was in a completely different league to this shit we have now, the sound is literally BROKEN, to an unplayable point, interchange is completely dead and you can be in 2nd floor queen on reserve and hear literally everything happening in the bunker and it sounds *exactly* the same as if it was in the room with you, *that is beyond broken and worse sound than any game I have played in 20 years of my life*

I've had maybe 2 or 3 good raids this wipe, all the others have been ruined by broken sound broken mechanics or broken ai

This is my 4th wipe, and for awhile every wipe performance got better, the game got better, and dealing with the bugs and shit was easier because of that, I had some confidence issues would be fixed

Now the game is regressing by design, being made worse by choice, sound, AI and performance are in the worst place its been in 5 years for me

And now they are started to add arbitrary time gates to quests like gunsmith etc... What the fuck is going through their minds is beyond me


Oh and then light keeper, yeh you know the guy that's been the main content being talked about for months, guess what? Your highly likely never to see him before release, because its end game *beyond* kappa, so yeh I hope the sub 1% of people who reach that manage to work all the bugs out on their own in this apparent beta test


Anyway rant over, the frustration is real because when it's working it beats any other game, I just really hope they pull their shit together before the momentum around this game grinds to a halt and it starts hemorrhaging players

I havnt even had a morning coffee yet"
iAteTheWeatherMan,"This game caught lightning in a bottle and they don't know how to handle it. I've never played a game before that as time goes on it takes significant steps backwards. It's like development is moving sideways at times. 

They clearly do not have any idea on how to develop their game professionally or hire anyone who can fix some of these issues. 

The hacking is here to stay and as I've said before, I truly believe that for every blatant hacker there are 9 other hackers not turning their aim-bot to the max or using radar."
Sinew3,"Can't wait for them to fix one big issue, get showered with praise and then game is still unplayable cause of all other issues."
AussieBogan92,""" the icing on the cake is I can't even get a simple tweet or mass e-mail about when something as simple as a fucking Christmas tree is being deleted from the game so my resources don't go to waste.""  


THIS. this infuriates me the most. They have no CS and their communication is dogshit. This whole secrecy thing they do isnt cute. You bring up a genuine concern or question and they never respond either by email or social media. Big event happening? You wont know until the tweet about it a few hours before it happens or they just spring it on you.

&#x200B;

I didnt find out about the scav nerf until big streamers started tweeting about it. Like, what? How hard is it to put up a patch note on the launcher to say yeah we patched the scavs. Instead they shadow nerf them and only tell streamers.."
fullylaced22,i personally just dont have the time or find it worth it to sit in a loading screen for 20 minutes to play the game for 10
Enthused_Llama,">  we're going to be going on 7 years of this game this year, and THIS is where we're at. 

Real Cyberpunk hours"
DeathGuardEnthusiast,"It's to the point where I've considered buying the cheats that let you see the data of other players (name, k/d, etc) just to see how often some dude with a >20 k/d just wipes out his side of the server."
I-wanna-fuck-SCP1471,"Nothing is gonna be better until we get some actual competition and no, i dont mean DMZ or midauders."
TP_Gillz,"The sheer stupid amount of time I've had to put into this game just to get borderline below average at it, is exactly whats keeping me playing it.

The game forces you to sink 100+ hours, likely way more, just to feel like your getting the hang of things. 

Sad part is, the majority of those hours are spent on a loading screen or in your stash/trader window.

The frustrations are real."
DankBeansBrother,"I want to play this wipe, but the downside to dying isn't losing my gear, it's spending 10-15 minutes building a kit and loading into a raid again."
-Shaskis-,"I have 4K hours with 5 years of experiencing BSG, and I believe this may be my last wipe, no communication, ghost changes out the wazoo for “immersion” but if they were going for immersion my 5.56 wouldn’t have more recoil than my 7.62 ak just because I slapped a muzzle brake on it. Or how there are bugs still in the game from years ago, or all of the content and no fixes, like how am I getting more information from a YouTuber than the company that I gave my money to.

PS:Just a little icing on the cake, the anti cheat hasn’t been touched in almost 3 years."
Iam0224,"Im gonna be honest here with yall, I'm scrolling through these comments endlessly like this is group therapy. I'm so beyond done with this game. It really did have potential. I've been around since VERY early Alpha. This company really just blows my mind have their sheer lack of willpower to put together a game, that when finished, could be what the entire FPS community has been looking for. But instead they take the easy way out and focus their energy on making twitch drops work or some stupid faux MLG tournaments to raise Clicks and Searches for the game. If they simply had the offline raids have a seperate stash and hideout with its own progression, I PROMISE 90% of us would stop complaining about 90% of what we currently complain about. Of course we are going to complain when it's been close to 10 years in this pre release state. You make this game with SO many promises because you want to sell pre release copies to make money to help develop the game, well you definitely sold the copies NOW WHERE THE FUCK IS THE DEVELOPMENT! 3 new guns, a broken map, and an absolute army of cheaters paying less than $20 each for their hacks. Fuck this game, I'm going (back) to ARMA."
Commiesstoner,"I love this game but after the 7th time running into a hacker on Lighthouse in a few days I'm just done. Deleted everything in my stash and uninstalled, I won't be tempted ever again. 

Last straw was running up to building 1 and hearing two people on the roof, being told to leave in VOIP, running to the other side of the building and proning about 100m+ towards building 2 during the night. They throw a nade at me from the roof that barely misses then they side step onto the stairs and instantly head jaws me, that was the first time they peaked and I made 0 noise or movement after laying down. 100% hacker. 

The amount of them I've come across this wipe that are happy to run past you or act oblivious until you shoot at them and then suddenly 180 head eyes is fucking atrocious. I can always tell when it's gonna be a white name hacker because they just don't care about cover or whether you have high ground and they always react with precise aim within a few seconds of your first shots when you see them first."
SlaveDeMorto,"With how this game is centered around risk-reward the final nail in the coffin for me after roughly 900 hours was cheater situation (both blatant and sus omnipotent players). It's not about gear fear, more like a feeling of me being a plankton for cheaters to grind up so that they could sell stuff to RMT whales. Paired with the feeling that Tarkov doesn't appreciate my time as a player (with how many QoL things are lacking). To top it off this ""wipe hype"" ended for me in just a couple of days. I never cared about Streets so 0.13 was extremely underwhelming.

And last but not least, spending 5-15 minutes between raids playing tetris/waiting for players to load into the raid is not fun. AT LEAST THEY FIXED AN AUDIO BUG WHERE YOU HAD TO LISTEN TO THE FREAKING RAIN FOR 10 MINUTES WHILE WAITING FOR PLAYERS IN YOUR LOBBY TO LOAD.

Even though I bought EoD edition, playing Tarkov for me feels like playing a free-to-play game on a free account and knowing there are premium players that have fun in it while I exist for the sole purpose of making the game more fun for someone else."
vzmike,"I couldn't word the current sad state of the game better honestly. Maybe could mention the other things that have been broken for years in this game that OP probably didn't to avoid having an aneurysm, but that's about it."
Kilo-Nein,"You really want the game to be exciting and fun again?

Drop all the shit changes they've done to fight RMT. Bring back the economy in the game as it was 2 years ago. It was worth fighting and playing then. Locking shit down has brought the cheaters out in droves and made the game just flat out unenjoyable for the rest of us.

Reverse the FIR changes. Reverse the market changes.  Make the market completely open with no item bans. Allow gear from dead players to be sold on the market. Reverse the limited keys. Up the boss spawn rate massively. Drop scav spawn times.

All this shit to combat RMT and players with millions in rubles. Who fucking cares? Really, allow players to make money again and they wouldn't be looking at RMT to get an edge in the first place. After all, you could have a billion rubles and still be absolutely SHIT at PVP or PVE. 

Make this shit the wild west it once was, instead of the stale, overmanaged garbage that it has turned into. That's what made the whole game fun in the first place."
WRAITH01,"TLDR - Games a joke, OP is right not matter how much i want to play every raid is cheaters, desync, freeze and just problems with the Developers response being *""HAHA our game is broke we dont care and its fully of cheaters get used to it""*  


Im 100% with you OP i have TRIED to play this wipe but the cheating is to far gone, its every raid - flying, aimbots wallhacks whatever in 1 week of playing iv seen it all and iv brushed it off each time as ""next raid will be clear of this"".  


Then iv seen entire squards being Headeyes in 10second by 1 scav to invincible flying player on lighthouse flying around killing the new boss. Or just the really sus moments where you get instant shot without making a noise etc.   


These sus deaths make it even harder to accept with what im seeing. I like to think ""oh i got outplayed"" but with how easy it is to just hack this games code it wouldnt suprise me now.   


Combine that with any attempt to play the new map without DC/rubber banding or just freezing and you have your .13 patch. 

I sat out the last wipe as people said the hacking was insane, main stream - streamers posting videos of literal fllying hackers this wipe as well. Sumit confirming for ever fly hacker theres easily 100 aimbot wallhack cucks pretending to be good.    


Im hopeful BS will be doing something id even be happy to implement invasive anti cheat at this stage but  With Nikita saying ""it will never change"" how can I /we be convinced to play this game?  


Some one talk me back into or give me a sliver of hope, is there some way to avoid these scum? Chosing a certain server to play on or something?"
spacetimehypergraph,"lmao, if people with 2000+ hours are quitting, imagine how time constrained players (like max 10 hours a week) feel. This game cant be played without nolifing it, the in game population just gets insane gear and you cant even buy bullets that can pen them. Thats besides the insane map knowledge you need to not die to cheese.

I love the game, but i dont have the time to play it like a fulltime job, so i just dont even bother. Go hard or go home = tarkov"
Billy1138,"I don't even PMC anymore, if I feel like bothering I'll scav in, find some shit and get out, then go again 20 minutes later if I feel like it because.... after almost 3k hours, I am just done with the repetition."
AlcoholicSkeleton,Not being able to share a quest key with friends when you are the only one with it and you're getting off sucks ass. Like that's the worse change they've done so far somehow.
WH4L3_88,"I get the game is in development and I’m willing to deal with new additions and the issues that come along with those additions but I’ll agree that this wipe seems more taxing than most.

First, I hope they fix the frame rate/phasing issue on streets. I really want to put in time to learn the map but I keep getting stuck on what seems like invisible geometry, phasing in place as I try to move forward while spamming jump in hopes to release my character, only to get shot in the face. So, the one thing that I was looking forward too is basically unplayable at the moment.

Scavs seem worse this wipe too. Sometimes I turn a corner, hear a scav yell and instantly get blasted in the face with no time to react. Yea, I get that it’s a hardcore shooter but come on.

I don’t feel as though I’ve encountered any cheaters, yet. The PvP I’ve experienced so far felt pretty good but I know it’s only a matter of time before that experience is ruined.

Maybe one day Tarkov will be good."
Wirenfeldt,I just want to build stupid weapons and slaughter AI damn it.. I have no desire to get curb stomped by kids with more time and way better reflexes than myself..
Thesaladman98,"4000 hours here. Tarkov used to be hard-core in a fun way. It was unforgiving but progress wasn't hard.  Now I have gotten kappa (not this wipe), max traders every other wipe pretty much, and every wipe they just keep removing stuff from the game. Like I can't use certain guns anymore because they are either horse shit or you can't buy ammo, same with armor, so I'm stuck with using the same meta kist for 1.5 years if I want to quickly progress, and I have to basically get to super late game to check out the new light keeper content that was so hyped up. It's not worth doing what I've done before 8 times already. Sure the new map is kinda cool but it's really nothing special, just some new buildings. I mean where's that tank boss they showed? The destrucatable walls? It's literally just a few streets and half the building you can't go into.

Take rust for example. Great game. Super hard-core if you play for domination (note: there's other more forgiving ways to play the game) they update it every month, usually with content that isn't that big, just like one new gun. Or update a monument slightly. But these are important gameplay changes. When bsg adds a gun it's usually just a resting of a gun we've already had or it uses some shitty ammo and pretty much you just use it once then go back to what can actually win fights. In rust you can kill pretty much anyone with any loadout because they balanced it so that it's more or less skill based (even with bloom and less recoil, rust pvp is more skill based). They keep it fresh by literally just changing the values of one monument, like they make it so the quarries can now take diesel fuel and give more farm, now for a full month everyone is fighting over them and forever you have an alternate playstyle to try for a wipe. Tarkov isn't like that. You start the wipe, you HAVE to go customs and woods. You want to win? Use these guns because they can actually kill faster. The progress is so linear that they can't just keep wiping it and expect people to follow the exact same path every time. That shit gets boring. You see people on rust with 10-20k hours, still having constant fun every wipe. You see people in tarkov with like 2k hours already complaining how unfun this shit is."
murrkpls,"BSG is an inept developer, everybody who has played this game for more than a few hundred hours knows that. If people enjoy it, that's great, but lets call a spade a spade."
futilecause,"here lies OP, they hated him because he spoke the truth."
Wunon,"I completely agree with all of this, this is my 5th wipe and I remember when the game was grindy and a little bit tedious, but at least the fun PVP, good loot, and intense moments made up for it. Now maybe every 50 raids you get this because most raids you get killed by a cheater, bullshit AI, bugs, etc. 

I can't wait to see a post in 2 days with the topic of ""burrr me have fun, game have no problem, complainers have skill issue"" And be top of this subreddit for a few hours."
AXUSRAID,"The game mechanically has never felt worse than it does now, gunplay is so floaty and riddled with rng it's hilarious, scavs well yh, repetition repetition repetition is the name of the game, like you said the highs are so rare now it's not even fun, it's not even worth coming in high geared because of the risk of getting focused by a cheater."
Spageroni,"Sorry if a lot of people have mentioned it already as I’m a little late to the party, but if you want a non-scuffed tarkov-esque game, I highly recommend playing Dark and Darker when the playtest comes back. Very similar to tarkov in the inventory management/gameplay (kinda) but it’s medieval fantasy. The queues take about 15-30 seconds from queueing to being in game, and once you get a hang of how the game works it’s very rewarding!

Sadly the game isn’t actually out until the end of the year, but they do week long play tests every couple months (next one is in February). 

I’m sure a lot of people here know about the game already but though I’d mention it just in case!"
Crujien,"Tree got removed yesterday without notic.

I got 2 red balls from drops today.

Can anything say ""fuck you community"" even louder?"
NvIWraith,"with the server crunch, its very hard if not impossible to get empty raids now, it was noticeable as soon as they did it.  


I agree though Tarkov is pain.  


Its funny seeing everyone reach their limit on how much they can take before the throw in the towel though.  


Personally i dont think they ever expected Tarkov to blow up as much as it did, the built the game ontop of terrible infrastructure and the only thing they can do is patch holes over and over again praying that its fixed.  


Every wipe, we get the same posts of people saying theyre quitting, saying theyre done with the game yet every wipe the game gets bigger and bigger, even with its issues."
1BalledBandit,This game is now a waiting room for Dark and Darker. God I can't wait to just jump into games and not spend 20mins re-kitting and waiting in que. Fuck tarkov
Sureshot_Kitteh,"1500 hours since alpha and I agree, my duo and I are uninterested after 10 days."
Megalodong6969,I left Tarkov and don’t miss it at all. I stick around the sub for an arena update lol
paralyzedvagabond,"I’ve only been in for a 2 1/2 wipes and I’m getting tired of their “fixes” to combat rmt. How’s about instead of making the game pain to get a fucking fetch quest done, you make the game more accessible. That is not to say make it easier but pan out the unnecessary bs to get a fucking quest done so we can all move on with our lives and enjoy the rest of the game. 

And for the love of god put everything back on the flea, why is it a problem to pay for good gear that somebody else found and doesn’t want? Not everyone has the time to grind for days to get traders maxed or go on stash runs in hopes of getting a slick or something decent"
Cain-x,"The more people are awake the more we have chances for things to change in the future.

Just like real life.

Great post."
bluepot360,"Played the hell out of last wipe, almost level 50 before quitting in September. Quit at level 8 this wipe, still trying to understand what part of this game I found good.

The gunplay is shit, the movement is shit, the audio is shit, the queue times are shit, the scav programming is shit, the ammo/scope changes are shit, it's all shit. I seriously can't think of one compliment for this game in its current state, and I don't see it getting better."
TsTyCZ,"Well I agree with most things to be fair.

The worst part is that people are still able to simp BSG and say ""wElL iT iS jUsT a BeTa"". I have no idea how is this level of incompetence even accepted in 2023.

Unfortunately companies / games with no real competition tend to end like that."
-Cokeman,"Came here just to say this after dying to a standard account with random letters and numbers as his name for the third time today. From like 200 meters with buckshot nonetheless.

Sadly found this, and a few similarly posts so I didn't even need to make one.

8-9 wipes in. It's so sad to see how far one of my favorite games has fell. I too will be dropping it indefinitely."
yobyexe,Been here since Shoreline released so 0.6? 0.5? Can’t remember it’s been a long time. So far I’m lvl 20 and jve died to 6pmc and about 25 scavs who the overwhelming majority have been to head eyes. Good game design. This patch has definitely felt like it’s gone backwards in terms of quality
TheOofG,"this game has only gone downhill since I started playing in 2020, idc what anyone says, this game was a lot more fun when the recoil was easy, inertia wasn't in the game, and you could carry more stuff before you became over weight. you used to run into every gun in the game because they all felt good, regardless of whether or not they were decked out or barebones. you'd run into fights all the time, and the fights felt good, but all the shitters just had to keep on complaining about how good everyone else is, and instead of just getting better they convinced the biggest shitters of them all to make the game worse."
Ok-Life8294,"I'm honestly really close to quitting. It's just not worth it anymore. Atleast before you could count on fun end game pvp.

But now every fucking lobby has cheaters, scavs have literal built in aimbot and walls and their one bullet hits 3 times and ONLY ever the thorax.

They made leveling take longer, fucked with the spawns, lag that I've never had before, players more toxic than ever before. It's just not worth it.

I don't mind change, and the game had plenty of problems in 2019, 2020 etc. But I'd gladly trade those past problems for the ones we have today. It's gotten significantly worse. And just not fun."
bollincrown,"It’s amazing how efficiently BSG has driven the game into the ground. It’s got so much potential, but as you point out, it’s not worth the increasing amount of BS you has to put up with to experience it. 

I’ve already decided I’m done playing this wipe and I haven’t even seen streets. It’s just not interesting to me since there’s nothing new about the game, and the performance is ass. I will probably just avoid this game until full release, if that ever actually happens."
nevetz1911,That's because it's beta /s
Doug_Step,"I'm out, couldn't care less about half the shit but until the audio is good, the PvP combat isn't a coin flip and the maps run better than a pegleg pirate it's just not worth it.  
The highs this game gave me were amazing but as the excitement faded I realised the layers of shit that we had to deal with and it's just not worth the suffering, especially when half the time the shit interrupts the highs and slams them down"
Scratchpaw,I’ve made the switch to Hunt:Showdown and I’ve been having more fun there than I ever did in Tarkov.
Wuusa1993,"EU Server here. 2 minute queue times, cheater maybe in 1 out of 10 raids. This an NA problem, or just a Reddit problem?"
TroleyWoW,"Yeah, cheaters, audio, Streets performance, and couple of different bullshit this game is not fun anymore. For maybe 10 raids I can do one good raid this is not fun. This is one big disaster"
jeff5551,"I didn't realize we were at 7 years now, holy hell time flies"
Suns0ut,"Loving all the comments saying ""ugh you ONLY have 1700 hours?"" Like yeah dude people have lives lmao."
themacbeast,You're leveling up you're gamer wisdom. Congrats. A lot of people never get there.
Even-Answer483,"Yeah after my experience this weekend, Imma sit this wipe out. Asia server is a toss up which server I get and able to play without high ping, Audio issue, rubberband in place the whole raid, 29 white christmas balls useless now, 20fps streets, more RGB gamers than I've ever seen.

4500 hours of like you said, cock and ball torture simulator."
AdobeMan,Are people cheating only because of how tedious the game has become? I would genuinely like to hear from some cheaters as to why they're doing it this wipe.
EngiNERD1988,"100% agree.

Uninstalled yesterday"
btc018,"AMEN. Game is pretty pathetic after 7 years. 1 step forward in some ways, 4 steps backwards in other ways. As a casual player for the past 3 years, I’ve completely lost interest."
Dyyrin,"Stopped playing because I got tired of grinding quests/rep for it just be taken away and start over. The PvP has just evolved into who knows how to abuse broken game mechanics to have the edge. The same guns wipe and wipe again to become the meta. All these stumps and crazy shit they keep adding just makes any player joining a wipe late fucked because getting into a fight with a guy who all the stims is going to win 100% of the time unless the new player gets lucky. Scavs are so inconsistent wipe to wipe and just further shows that BSG doesn't know how to program AI. Audio has been dogshit for the whole 6 years I've owned this game and doesn't seem to ever be getting better. Love this game it's an insane game, but fuck it has issues."
Thanos-1996,Sadly as I have played EFt so much in  the last two years I have became numb to it's countless issues. Playing any other FPS reminds you of how flawed it's fundamentals are after 5 years in beta.
kadensfrfx,7 years of development and i cant change my email to my acount : D!!!!!!!!
MangooKushh,"I stopped playing like 4-5 wipes ago and I don’t regret it. The game is unique, I’ll give it that, no other game other there like this. But it needs to step up on MANY things. Fuck the content. We need optimizations, different rules and regulations for everything, cheating needs to be fixed, flea market adjustments, server issues, scav issues, scav bosses 3 bullets to the chest issues, please add more to the list. 

They need to get their shit together and fix this game. Are they planning to fix it once all the guns, maps and bosses come out?

Edit : what is the end product gonna look like? Cause I hope it won’t be constant wipe after wipe."
DynamisFate,"I’m a classic sound whore and with this wipe’s audio, nuh uh. Glhf see yall next wipe."
Cameroncen,You simply cannot play casually enjoyably anymore so I’m just not playing
Tiaesstas,"3500hrs here and i know you mean and feel it to the heart.
You missed the point where they put content behind ultra rare items that are so far away from normal people or even grinders to get that its insane. You can find these ultra rare items in the game but theres a esp boy that already know where it is and yoinks it before you even knew it existed in your raid."
AbundantIndifference,"Ngl, was getting ready to reinstall after a 4 month break and i'm really glad I went to the reddit first. I hope EFT dies the death in the bed it's made for itself."
BeneficialMix7851,Honestly certain dayz servers are basically tarkov but better and imo go play them instead of this broken pos
SushiLeader,"I stopped over a year ago due to the grind. It’s just not fun. My friend I used to play with stopped being my friend, so I choose to not play it anymore. It’s already tough and grindy as is, but solo just isn’t it for me."
ryanpmc,You got me with “cock and ball torture simulator”
i_need_salvia,People learning that you can play other games that actually function
Nater_X,Yup. Quit this week. I don’t like gambling with the few hours of free time i have a night to end up miserable and upset after a string of bad raids.
Alyosiki,BGS is a trash company
SoulsEdge001,"It blows my mind that it's been 7 years and this game hasn't been PUBG'd yet. All I want is a game that goes ""here's a heap of guns, heaps of funny lights and bits of glass you can put on them, go nuts, have fun LARPing about with your mates"". Don't even have to get the licenses, just let me make a slick M4 I saw in a movie once and not have it be putting me at a huge disadvantage."
pinkninja117-a,"SPT is the best thing that's happened to this game. Make it as hard or as easy as you want, remove all the stupid shit meant to slow down progression and combat cheaters. BSG has terrible priorities and it feels like there's nothing left of the original vision. PvP boils down to who lives closet to the server and how if they have magic bullets and armor."
headcase1111,"I think they've gone too far with hardcore to the point its just tedious. 

I liked this game for the PVP at the time and the thrill of a good extraction. Before all the flea changes, you could build a decent kit and have fun as long as you go the cash, which wasn't too hard. 

Now you have to grind for so fucking long just to have a somewhat decent kit. I'm talking like 20+ hours before you're even competitive/decent. 

As someone with a life, that shit just ain't worth it anymore."
Ok-Street-7240,"People who say enjoy the game are the content creatots whose income depends on the game, cheaters and that’s about it."
KrabbitNL,"Fully agree, I've played about 6 or 7 wipes. I'm about 2000 hours deep into this game, and with every wipe the game has gotten worse. The biggest kick in the nuts has been all the anti-rmt and FIR shit to me. Couple that with the terrible desync, horrid audio, cheaters, continuously worsening quest-design (keys with 1 use and RNG spawns? U serious?), framerates that drop about 20fps per wipe, and so on and so forth and it's just no longer worth putting any time into.   


The game doesn't respect it's players, the time they put in or the money they've spent, why would I invest any more time and energy into something like that?   


I'm fully out now, have been since last wipe. I only check in here to see how things are looking, only to see the same issues getting worse and worse every wipe, with new bugs being added, and none of the old shit being fixed."
MatrixBunny,"Problem is that BSG/Nikita are ignorant af, claiming the game has no issues. Audio is fine, AI scavs didn't get changed.

Even if there are highly voted threads here PROVING otherwise, they won't change it.

Then you have their 'biggest' streamer(s) complain about the same things, such as Pestily and they'll LITERALLY band-aid 'fix' it during the livestream, saying they adjusted AI scavs.

EFT is just an experimental project for BSG and therefore optimization/performance fixes aren't their priority. I feel like they have proper creative artists that also meddle with mediocre coders/designers regarding every feature the game offers thus they rather release a new half-assed feature upon another one, that comes with its own issues.

They never finish any of their features they introduced. They release it after delaying it for ages in a half-assed state with this vision they have at the time on what it plans to become when it's fully functional/released. Yet they NEVER finish any of the features for YEARS, some are still not complete after all this time. The majority of the skills are completely useless."
Sunkysanic,"At least you did make a well thought out complaint post I guess, but I just don’t understand why people feel the need to come here and announce to the world that they’re quitting the game. Just go play something else man, not a big deal lol. I am at about 2000 hours myself, and I haven’t played this wipe much. Mostly because I’ve been busy, but also because I just haven’t felt like investing the time into it. 

I may not agree with every change BSG makes but I’ve never felt slighted like so many people here seem to. I don’t understand that mindset. I haven’t lost interest in the game because of what BsG is doing, I still love this game and playing it feels like nothing else. I bought satisfactory on sale last month and I’ve been really into that, it’s been refreshing playing something totally different. 

I’ll die on the hill that people are just so emotionally invested in this game that they take everything out on BSG. I have died a lot the raids that I have managed to play this wipe but I haven’t felt the need to blame it on anyone but myself. I.e, skill issue. With the exception of cracked scavs, because holy shit they’re rough right now. But honestly, I don’t mind. It gives the game a new dynamic and has forced me to play differently than last wipe.

People complain about cheating and net code and all that shit and I’ve never understood why people act like bsg is different than any other dev out there. Last fall when the new CoD MW came out, I played that for about 15 hours or so, and the whole time I was thinking how do people stay so outraged over BSG when this game plays like *actual dog shit* as far as net code goes. In the ~15 hours I played that game, I couldn’t tell you how many times I called bull shit on a death. Dying around corners, rubber banding, hits not counting. Not to mention, it was so lacking of content i felt totally ripped off for paying 70 bucks  for it. Meanwhile people will play thousands and thousands of hours of eft and complain that it isn’t finished. And that’s a dev with god knows how many more resources than bsg. Maybe not the best comparison but I think it’s valid.

TL;DR: this community fucking sucks. And I’m Not aiming that at you, OP, But I firmly believe that this community and its collective terrible, entitled attitude is having a far more detrimental impact on the state of the game than anything BSG does.

I know I’ll get downvoted because I’m not feeding the hive mind but whatevs lol"
AFlyingOrange,"The game started going downhill when BSG decided focusing on anti-RMT instead of QoL features. The FIR system is dogshit, same with the limit on dropping basic items, and flea market restrictions that make no sense.

The whole point of a flea market is to sell stuff, but when BSG blacklists stuff like armor/ammo it makes no sense. Oh you found 30 rounds of 7.62 BP and you want to sell it on the flea, get fucked cause you can't. Oh you found a rare gun, get fucked you cant sell it.

The FIR system is beyond stupid. If I put something in my gamma and I die with it, it should count as FIR because it was literally found in raid. Then traders want you to find a giant purple dildo but it has to be found in raid or they wont accept it.  


If their main concern is RMT and Cheaters, they should make building a better anti cheat system a top priority instead of ruining key features of the game"
xoull,Amen
Ok_Alternative_2541,"Interesting. Me and my friends are having a great time. Hope you find a game you enjoy. Cheers!

Edit: 1100 hrs in. I take wipes off.  I love the grind.  I bought the game knowing it was a beta. I bought the game knowing it was a small Russian dev team. My expectations have always been extremely low ( as it should be for everyone despite how big the game has become)."
ThatGuyNamedKal,"Me and the lads picked up the game yesterday and played for the first time and I think it's safe to say we're not coming back.

Our biggest negative takeaway is that if we want to play co-op PvE to practice then we each have to fork out €90 extra to upgrade our game packages. Which is quite frankly bullshit after we just spent €40-45 on the damned game."
Pluto-RS,See you tomorrow lmao
Kamhel,"It is very much not worth installing for me, as I work full-time. 
And I can't dedicate every second of my spare time to gaming. 

I learned years ago that the first week of a wipe is the only time I can enjoy the game."
ColdPower5,"The first line of your post is what I asked myself 5 mins ago. 


I played other games over the end of last wipe. 

Changed my day-to-day experience for the better. 

This game doesn’t pay off well. 


It reminds me when I tried playing cricket as a kid. I thought I’d like it, but then realised I was always being frustrated by it. I then quit. 

I went to rugby the next year. God damn - I was in heaven and played as much as I could for decades thereafter. 

I think cricket is like EFT. Sure it’s great for some people. It ain’t for me. I respect it but it’s objectively quite a stagnant/tedious/anxious/frustrating game that wastes lot of time. 

Rugby is brilliant with the skill, exhilaration and highs with little trade-off. Like other shooter games out there vs EFT."
SayNoToStim,"This is the result of a small time developer creates a product that got super popular and they have no idea how to handle it.

And I wouldn't be annoyed if it weren't for the arrogance of BSG. If they came out and said ""holy shit guys, this was way more popular than we expected, we're going to do our best to live up to everyone's hopes,"" I'd probably be way more accepting of the game.

The  game actually has gotten better from a technical standpoint since it's peak in 2019 but it feels like every gameplay decision has made it worse. I heard they ""overhauled quests"" this wipe but it's still the same shitty quests. It's still killing scavs on customs. It's still a bunch of quests you either have prior knowledge of or have to look up on the wiki. It's still added frustration without the offset of feeling of satisfaction when you do accomplish something.

Take SBIH - why the fuck was that increased to 125? That wasn't an accident or a malfunction, someone had to sit down and think about how 100 wasn't good enough, let's move it to 125. 

They're using twitch streamers as their form of advertisement and dragging out the ""early game"" with them is just more free advertisement while hurting or annoying the average shmuck. 

I look at other developers and they communicate effectively, if something is super unpopular they adjust. Of course no community is ever going to be super happy with everything, but it just feels like they don't give a flying fuck, they've already got your money."
JetLag_550,The only reason people still play this game is because there is literally 0 competition. I really hope we get something close in the next few years. I’m so tired of waiting for this game to improve.
vgamedude,"Yep. Just loaded in on Lighthouse and died to a _____ttv with level 5/6 gear, fully suppressed dmr, and m62. Nice.

This isn't a game for normal people it's a streamer game."
Conserliberaltarian,Am I the only one actually having fun? Try playing with friends and taking the game less seriously if you're playing solo. It's a different expirence.
TLGorilla,"I check this sub every now and then to see if these things have changed but honestly I uninstalled the day Nikita malded on Twitter and said everything that they can do about cheaters is being done. Maybe that's true and a good faith statement, but if it is, they have lost to the cheating industry big time. 

And I'm not even sure that it is true. I saw in one cheating discord an unban service with hundreds of pictures of people confirming they got unbanned. How is that even a thing they can hack? Or is someone at bsg making some side money? I really hope that one is just a scam but hundreds of +rep pictures is a lot for just a scam. 

I think anyone with a four digit amount of hours in the game could literally care less about new content. I'd play all day with a fixed netcode, fixed audio, and at least maybe a full raid replay system so I can at least have the peace of mind to know if I got cheated on or not. I think a lot of people would be surprised by how many cheaters aren't rage hacking but just avoiding pvp and scooping the best loot. Subtle/silent cheating makes up a lot of it."
Hi_Im_Col,I see a post like this every wipe. I’m still loving tarkov myself
KevinsLunchbox,honestly. play a new game. why do you keep playing if you're this upset after 1700 hours. you're doing it to yourself.
RC3_Skywalker,I played this game for a few weeks and quit because the time investment wasn’t worth it.
KnightsWhoNi,Aight. See you tomorrow.
Ehzaar,Ok
ToolComp5141,"I don't disagree, but like, making games is hard. Life is hard, gotta make money, and Tarkov gave me the best gun autism-simulator ever, and some of the sickest highs I've ever had. You got 1700 hours out of it, it's fine."
RJohn12,at first the 'hardcore' gameplay felt good. but the more I mastered the systems the more I realized that BSG just tacks the 'hardcore' nomenclature on anything they can't properly design
PR05ECC0,"I felt the same way last wipe and deleted the game. This wipe I made it about 10 raids before I deleted it. Ran into a cheater, and a scav that made no sound.

I loved this game, have played it since the beginning but I think it has run its course. It sucks but that’s what happens with video games these days. Hopefully something new will fill its place."
allleoal,People still complain about malfunctions? I havent had a single one all wipe. Tf are you guys doing? Full auto-ing a drum mag with 50 durability suppressed gun with M61?
Aman4029,"They’re well aware the game is shit, and will continue to be. 

They’ll do the bare minimum needed to call it a full game, releasing the tiniest crumbs of content, whilst adding amazing ‘balance’ changes, keeping their eyes and ears shut from the feedback because ofc they know better. 

They know that they’re not competent enough for what they’ve set out to do, which is why this game has an expiration date. It’s already funded that other shit game they wanna make, so all focus will probably be on that, and this game will never be in a polished state, and will keep having these deep rooted issues it has today."
edituplayu,"I've had this game since it was in Alpha( like from 2017 or something).

Only started playing properly this wipe, honestly it's fun and there is nothing like it, I am only level 12 at the moment and with recent scav ai fix every firefight seems fair to me, whenever I get blasted or I win. BUT the recoil system is such a garbage mechanic and why the hell my PMC is starving after having a hike in woods for 30 minutes  with an empty backpack."
CeistDeuce,Game is shit.
Darth_Jones_,If you read this sub you'd actually think nobody has fun playing the game. This is the most fun wipe yet for me. If I disliked a game as strongly as most of the people on this sub I'd have stopped playing long before I thought to write a post about it.
CLuke_,"""reeeeeeeeeeeeeee"" - average r/EscapefromTarkov reddit user"
FACEIT-InfinityG,"We are to blame for this , every wipe we come back , we absord and create the hype  ....... and we are always dissapointed so is it really BSG to blame? nah its us. If we keep coming back to our abuser we only have ourselves to blame"
NUTTA_BUSTAH,I was out for the past wipe or two or even three and got spoiled by other games. Will be sitting this one out too after the initial tests. Just gone backwards on my enjoyment but maybe in the summer it is fixed again.
Comparison_Long,Yea…every wipe I play less and less…Honestly having more fun replaying Breath of the Wild LOL
Kamhel,"It is very much not worth installing for me, as I work full-time.

I learned years ago that the first week of a wipe is the only time I can enjoy the game."
BreakDownSphere,Never was lol
JKCinema,See this just a matter of perspective. If you was a rat instead of a Chad life would just be so much better and more enjoyable. See idc about leveling traders because I’m not going to be going into raid  with anything of value anyway… that’s the chads job to bring me gear into raid. That’s just how the ecosystem works. They work their ass off to unlock all the cool shit only to get shit in the back by a veper hunter.
itsbrave,"played 11 wipes to level 40+ every time and this honestly after 4+ years of playing the game this wipe has been the worst experience i've ever had playing this game, there's so many glaring issues that just make the game completely boring and unfun to play"
Legendary_Lootbox,"I remember the good old days, before FIR was ever introduced. I'd play with friends all day long, run fun budget kits because death was around each corner yet I couldn't care less as I was making money each raid (by flippin mosin barrels on the market). I had so much fun with Tarkov, we played like 7/7. But the moment FIR hit, this is when our group died down, the fun was slowly leaking out of the experience and me and an OG friend tried coming back to Tarkov but we only got destroyed by the many desync issues there were back in 2020-2021 (can't remember in all honesty).  
Also 0 cheaters on EU servers, they all were locked in labs in those times. 

Now that I read more and more posts about in what state the game is (terminator scavs, cheaters, the eternal grind, leaky hideout). Sigh, wish I could go back to the fun glory days, where the AK was my universal rifle for everything."
lonigus,Aware... its like comming back to the same abusive relationship just for for the 1 minute of hot sex. .\_\_\_.
NaNiBy,They should stop adding more content (that is more or less simply bad or broken) and focus on game overall health. One wipe where there is nothing added and just a lot of bug fixes and anti cheat rework would be really good
Soulcaller,"Same, uninstalled it, waiting for arena after that am done with it...just look for something else. This devs are innept idiots, i hope everyone learn from it how not to develop a game. ""being misterious"" my ass."
,[removed]
mynutsaremusical,"It's not a good game to play if you're bad at games or don't have the time, I've found.

I can only handle 2-3 raids a day and they almost always end in death. So after a week or so everyone has armor I can't penetrate and ammo that rips through anything I can afford like it's made of paper.

Not to mention people seem to know all the routes to run and have all the loot snatched up before i can even find my bearings on the map. And yeah, I could learn these routes, but it comes back to the fact I have limited free time and skill and I don't want to waste it watching tutorials on how to loot on reserve over just playing the map. 

I got this game because I thought it would be a gritty atmospheric survival game where every bullet counts. But when you see the one pmc you've seen all raid and he absorbs your entire mag into his chest rig before he can even notice you were tickling him...I don't feel that gritty survival feel anymore.

More often than not I've been playing off-line with scavs so I can enjoy that feeling that drew me in. I want to feel like a guy left behind, just trying to survive. Not a warhammer 40k guardsman with a lascannon trapped in a room with 10 chaos space marines with bolters."
redwind62,"I was reading this while loading into lighthouse thinking ""idk i haven't really seen any cheaters this wipe"" and immediately get head eyes by a blatant aimbot lol"
WWDubz,"I made it to level 8 and said “Fuck your god damn bronze pocket watch. What the fuck did you do with the last 3 I got your dumb ass?”

The game is stale. Cheaters are rampant. Bugs galore. And a new map that’s so shitty-ly optimized it’s unplayable for half the community. 

But don’t worry guys, hand guards come in 2 pieces now. And there is an AUG. Oh, and light keeper exists 10 months later but you have to put razor blades up your Dick to see him. Ohhhh so hard core. 

The gun play is great minus the dumb recoil like the MP5. Just about everything else is ass from the unrewarding quest system to the audio that totally isn’t bugged but they are working on. 

Maybe I’ll see you in 7 another years when the game is “finished”"
Low-Assistant-5749,For the times when you kill the 3 man as a solo😃😃
nightcom,"Game itself is awesome, but wipes make it very demotivating - feels like waste of time. You spend 1000h+ and then wipe....all over again. That is only reason I stopped playing it"
cybae,"I picked up the game at the start of last wipe, standard edition, wasn't working full time back then yet, made it to max level traders and enjoyed the way there, especially the punisher quests. So far this wipe I have managed to get level 14 (having upgraded to eod by the end of the previous wipe) and my patience is being tested so incredibly hard both by the stupid barriers the game puts up against people who do not have 12 hours a day to dedicate and the incessant issues which constantly fuck you over even if you do everything ""correctly"".

The worst part is I desperately want to enjoy the game since I never feel like playing anything else but it is getting harder and harder even knowing what to and in what order, it just ain't enough since the devs don't think I deserve to enjoy the game in my free time...

EDIT: ah, and of course they decided to completely gut my favorite map, lighthouse, part for their fucking idiotic purposeless lightkeeper and part to prevent you from ""cheesing"" the rogues. You can't farm the Island and you can't farm the rogues, so then what is left? Of course, nothing. Well, on to streets we go until they gut it just like that in the next few updates..."
fiftyfiive,"What I find unacceptable is the amount of money I paid for the EOD which was supposed to be limited edition.

The price I have paid for a game in this state makes me suffer in regret and in anger. The revenue the developer most guaranteed has earned based on the viewer count on Twitch both in general and during the wipes/events, has to be on level with AAA-games."
Gadsden_Rattler,"This game is so bad, and it could be so good if the Devs gave a single shit"
Th3L1am4,"Oh,

I'm having a great time."
EaterOfFungus,bye
JuiciestCorn,"1700+ hours
Complains about basic parts of the game that ain’t changing.
Buddy you just need to play something else, you got your value from this product, stop milking the cow if its fuckin dry."
TheCons,"Sigh. Then leave. No one cares about these stupid long-winded ramblerants because nobody is going to say at any point in the future, ""man remember that reddit rando who used to play? good times, man
   
Uninstall it. Install something else. Unsub from here. Move on with life. If it isn't fun, stop playing and move on. You'll be happier."
RazorBundy,This game started to die with the FIR shit
WWDubz,"God forbid they have an announcement that isn’t some cryptic shitty note in Russian on FUCKING TWITTER. How to make it better hmmm oh gee I don’t know, maybe have the intelligence center include announcements?

Nahhh, we’ll just cuck for BSG and Nikita"
MaybeShun,If anyone feels like playing an Extraction Shooter that is WAYYY less frustrating you should try Hunt: Showdown. Tbf the game has some bullshit of it's own but none that really ruins the experience
EzKing_,"Because there’s too many people like you that commit their lives to the game and play to try to be the best, as oppose to playing to have fun. 

Stop treating Tarkov like a career and brain-numbingly min maxing your every movement, and play at a relaxed pace instead. Maybe then you might enjoy the nuances within the game and appreciate it for what it is."
Lyesalot,Have a break for a few wipes. That's what revived my interest in the game despite some glaring problems.
ashkiller14,"So many people talk about these ""blatant"" cheaters when frankly, i've seen one blatant cheater in my 900 hours and don't even see them posted on reddit/youtube that often.

From my PoV, when someone says shit like ""its not worth it anymore"" or ""theres no point because cheaters"" they immediately lose creditibility.

That being said, stop your bullshit and stop playing the game if youre not having fun instead of conplaining about it online. We all know you're not gonna stop playing anyway."
VirulentWalrus,"Tried doing Bunker part 2 tonight with a 3 man squad twice. Both times we ran into the most blatant hacker we’ve seen all wipe. Telling us to drop specific piece of gear, tailing us perfectly through the map, instantly head eyes us all, it was very fun"
DaRetardedGoat,Only 1700 hours and bringing up 7 years?
Richard-Long,"(Head,eyes) op how many wipes u been around for man, this ain't nothing new. Either get with it or get gone with this game, just how it is"
Dr_Jimmy_Brungus2,"Hey baby, I just want to ask you a question. How are all the big name steamers able to go to shoreline, lighthouse, and labs very kitted and not immediately die to cheaters? 

No doubt they exist, but their presence is not remotely close to the levels you are claiming. Seems like you are just bad and want to excuse your own piss play by saying there are always cheaters on those maps. Just accept that even with a gear advantage you are getting clapped and use that to figure out how to improve your play. 

The moment you stop whining about deaths and trying to he the victim, the game gets much more enjoyable."
Anoreth,"BSG created a system where you're all addicted to its cycle, and even at a certain point, you can just stop."
nyanch,"Thank goodness other games are picking up the format. If you're done with Tarkov, check out Marauders, The Cycle, and Dark & Darker. Hopefully the competition will either be better, or encourage BSG to work harder."
Monster_Dick69_,"the biggest issue is that the game demands SO MUCH TIME. You simply have to dump so much time into it every wipe. 

&#x200B;

I find myself wanting to watch streamers play instead of playing myself (this game stresses me out more than others)  but I don't stick around for Tarkov, I stick around for the streamer"
Radioactiveglowup,"The blatant cheaters are the worst. Not the aimbotters, you'll never really know... but the radar dudes. It's my 7th wipe at this point, and they get only more obvious the more you know and play.

Being ambushed by guys who could never have known you were there, people 360 spinning and knowing your window as you aim at them...

All that's why I'm staying out of this wipe. The game's great for a few days of rush where the mass of players outnumber the cheaters, but late wipe all that's there are radars which are in many ways, much meaner than aimbots."
Ziiiiiggy,"Brutal ain't it. I got to lvl 29 and lasted just over a week this wipe and I'm done already (which is bad because I love the game). The desync of this wipe is the worst I've seen in maybe 5 wipes. I don't mind losing gunfights by a mistake I make but when your fighting the game in terms of it actually working just kills the whole vibe. 

Glad I'm not the only one."
DabScience,"This is why Early Access / Beta Access games are always doomed to fail. You get burnt out before the game is even complete. BSG is small studio with WAY TOO LARGE ambitions and unwilling to get help from outside of Russia. Take streets for instance. Why on Earth are they making a map ""4x the size of other maps""? Lighthouse still runs like shit for half the people who play, but were going to get a map 4 times the size? These two maps also more assets made directly by BSG, and surprise, they are optimized even worse.

Game is a mess. A beautiful mess, but a mess none the less. We will never get a finished version of solid Tarkov."
Princesse_LaStar,"I agree on you about the fact BSG seems to care so little about there game. It's just a full push on new features and it doesn't go very well, tons of game produces more and with more qualify. They said to want the game be finished soon but the game is missing at least 50 percent of it's core features like story, maps, audio, graphics and others I don't remember.
I don't even know if the devs have a roadmap a minimal product viable something like that because it looks like they just dev whatever they want at time. They said all the time the code is spaghetti so well after 5 years of you can't undo the spaghetti just redo it, it will had take less time for sure.

Tho I like the game because it gave me feelings to share with friends I don't have on any other game. I also like the realism part of the game.
That's the sad part, they have a gem in hand but they are bad at polishing it."
FakeHair,"The Christmas tree thing got me. I spent 2 days doing nothing but farming ornaments from safes on Customs. Finally get my last white ornament for a weapons case, log off for the night (3am EST to 10am) and the tree has been deleted along with the case. I've been playing a LOT (level 32) and I can't imagine many people got that many ornaments, much less the roughly 50% more it takes for a ledx."
Brilliant-Resource39,"Couldn’t agree more man, 1300 hours for myself been playing since 2018 back in the days when there was no face hit box and if you had a map you could pick which side you spawned, to come back each wipe hoping they fixed one thing or another and to always be disappointed that it’s still the same has gotten real old, I took last wipe completely off hadn’t played in over a year. Came back this wipe to see what state the game was in and can easily say it’s probably the most unenjoyable it’s even been for me. Im just glad that the community is starting to realize that this game is a pile of shit covered in makeup that looks nice initially but once you get into it you uncover the truth. Rampant cheaters, the worst sound of an fps ever, way to Grindy, and a level of “realism” taken to the point of removing the fun from the game"
DKlurifax,This right here is a quality rage post. 10/10 would read again.
builder397,"And the icing on the cake: The game is balanced towards holding down the elite players from progressing too fast, with no fucks given about the average players. All scavs suddenly having raider aim is one of those things thats just there so they occasionally nail a chad in the face, but the heaps of average players who cant even finish their raids anymore are just collateral damage? Wtf kind of logic is this?"
Shejkenjunior1,"Same i'm 3k hours in and this is the first wipe i just lost all enjoyment of the loop. Shit is different this time around, not sure why."
seamon3y,Another one bites the dust
Kaneypoo69,BSG need to rebuild tarkov from the ground up its the only way the issues will be fixed. It's got such a terribly made foundation the bugs will only grow without them having a do over
