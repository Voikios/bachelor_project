FleaBottoms,Reaganomics is a proven Absolute Failure. Conservatives will not give it up. When pressed on Budget their solutions are cut taxes on the wealthy and reduce social services.
Timpa87,Stock buybacks were illegal until 1982 and considered market manipulation and were also one of the major things Reagan did to put us on an even more extreme wealth disparity track besides the huge tax cuts for the rich and corporations.
Da_Vader,"Until you remove money from politics, it's not gonna happen. In fact, money allows foreign influence rather easily."
3Grilledjalapenos,My cousin is terrified that democrats will “tax the hell” out of her.  She is a fourth grade teacher.
Sensate60,"Here's a good video with economist Richard Wolf talking about this.  Basically we cut taxes on the rich, the government loses those taxes and have to find the money for the military, social programs and much more, so they borrow from the very corporations and banks whose taxes they just cut, and pay interest on that money.
https://youtu.be/NR6n7ANHbu4. It's a win-win for those very wealthy corporations and banks.  It's sickening."
Huplescat22,">Here's what most people don't know: The wealthy used to pay higher taxes to the government. Now the government pays the wealthy interest on their loans to finance a swelling debt that’s been caused largely by lower taxes on the wealthy.

>A half century ago, American’s wealthy financed the federal government mainly through their tax payments. Tax rates on the wealthy were high: Under Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, they were over 90 percent. Even after all tax deductions, the wealthy typically paid half of their incomes in taxes."
donnie1984,"The “wealthy” are out of control. We have people like Bezos with more money than many countries, and CEOs are making disgusting amounts of money compared to their average employee. Our resources and wealth are being HOARDED by a small few. It’s not sustainable as a society."
dafunkmunk,The gop and the wealthy will happily bankrupt the entire country if it means more money for them.
Epistatious,"NPR today they were talking about how we need to keep wage growth suppressed to control inflation.  Haven't seen much wage growth since the 80s, **unless you are a CEO.**"
Elfyboy44,"Because you Americans have been programmed by the wealthy to call that socialism and even worse communism. The poor are enslaving themselves, but they’re happy because they believe that they are free. Every other developed country has 20+ days annual holiday, free/cheap healthcare, and maternity/paternity leave. You have guns and crippling poverty, a very bad combination, which leads to mass shootings."
PT0223,Tax the churches as well
VyrPlan,"this is the thing to remind republicans when they whinge about making America ""great"" again - what mostly made it great was a progressive tax that well-off americans didn't move heaven and earth to avoid paying and FDR's badly needed injection of socialism 

the notion that someone like trump (anathema to everything FDR wished for the US) could bring it about is roughly like hiring the cheapest prostitute you can find to help clear up your STD problem"
RickTracee,"Before Reagan, the very richest paid at least 74% of their income in taxes and CEOs took home just 30 times what their workers did. America's middle class was created.

Reagan cut taxes on the richest down to 28%. He also gutted unions, and CEOs make anywhere from 373 times or more than their workers do today.

The middle class is gone and instead there are now millions of ""working poor"" using credit cards and other gimmicks to believe they are still middle class"
Haunted_Optimist,Let’s go back to Eisenhower rates
Number-Thirteen,"And get rid of loopholes. If the rich/corporation does business in the country, tax them on the amount of profit made in the country."
Evn-erl,"The top 1% has over 41 trillion in wealth. 

If it comes between taking their stuff and putting tens millions of seniors on the street and stripping them of health care that’s an easy choice. 

But the reality is we don’t have to pay our debt tomorrow, we can take decades to pay it off so consider it like a 40 or 50 mortgage…in a country that makes 22 trillion plus per year in gdp…"
athornton79,"The same old talking points keep popping up in this thread over and over and over. The same bullshit the GOP have been feeding the public for the last 30+ years to justify their rampant theft of wealth for the top 1%. 

Trickle Down: A failed and patently absurd concept for Capitalism. COULD it work? In an ideal world where the wealthy ACTUALLY use that money for growth and development - sure. However, that never happened. Early on a few companies did re-invest in themselves but it was self-serving. They saw potential for more profits and expanded. After the first few years, all that excess 'profit' has gone towards themselves: increased executive salary (now to the order of 700x an average worker's pay from the 30x it used to be), stock buybacks, corporate takeovers to monopolize markets, etc. Trickle down was a fucking joke and the GOP knew it. The bulk of the American people (you know the ones) were just gullible enough to swallow it.

Social Programs or Revenue: This is ALWAYS the GOP's answer. Raise taxes (except NOT on the rich - because trickle down) or cut social programs. You know, the ""entitlement"" programs they are always so against because of ""socialism"" or ""communism"". Except that nasty word 'entitlement' is exactly that. You know your bank account that you deposit your check into every payday? You think you're ENTITLED to that money? Not according to the GOP! That's an entitlement! That's bad! The same for Social Security and Medicare. Those programs are PAID by the average worker every paycheck of their lives. Just like a savings account. It was originally a TRUST until Congress decided to rob the piggy bank. That's why the US is ""in debt"" to Social Security for so much - it BORROWED the money!! Its a DEBT the US owes now. You loan someone money, you think you're ""entitled"" to get it back? HA! Not according to the GOP! That's THEIR money now! But its money that's not making them or their wealthy cronies even more wealthy, so let's cut it, make it fail, then privatize it. Look at private insurance - no one has EVER had issues with medical insurance actually paying out and covering things, have they? Those are purely non-profit companies after all...

But what of the other spending of government? Defense? We spend more than the rest of the world combined on Defense - but we can't cut THAT by a dime! Too many military oriented companies rely on those big, fat military contracts year after year to maintain their profit margins. So we can't cut those! And if you want to cut some of the pork projects that Congress throws into the mix.. forget that! Unless its a Democrat's pork project, then its OK. 

Its a one-sided farce that the media and public keeps buying into due to decades of indoctrination. ""Both sides are the same"", ""Entitlements are bad"", ""Taxing the rich won't help"". Except all those points were proven wrong by history. No wonder Florida and other GOP strongholds are trying to dictate what schools can teach these days... they can't survive truth."
,"Good luck. They couldn't even get rid of the carried interest loophole (which basically only benefits private equity/hedge funds) when the Democrats had control of both houses of congress.  

There's a million ways for wealthy American's to avoid taxes (especially estate taxes). The IRS can target individual strategies (like the IRS Dirty Dozen), but it's all just a giant game of whack-a-mole, except the moles have the most talented lawyers and CPAs working for them. 

We also forget that there are foreign jurisdictions that would be more than happy to allow wealthy Americans to park their assets in their country. For example, Monaco on the Mediterranean Coast has no income tax or wealth tax for the purpose of attracting wealthy people.  

Rich people are always going to try to minimize their tax burden. They have the resources to take advantage of every loophole in the tax code that will benefit them. Unless there is a comprehensive restructure of the tax code (unlikely/see carried interest loophole in the first sentence of my comment), the rich will continue to take advantage of strategies that are literally ALLOWED for in the tax code and nothing will change."
Tyken12,nah not not gonna happen in this country- politicians dont actually care about the people
southpawOO7,To avoid high taxes corporations used to take that money and invest it in R&D. Some of the great American innovations came from the wealth of research money advancing our country. Now they buy boats and politicians.

Crowbar_Faith,"The lower / lower-middle class conservative voters don’t want to see the rich taxed because they hold on to the dream that oneday they themselves will be rich.

That and they fall for the conservative talking point of “Well if we tax the rich, it means they can’t create as many jobs, and the economy will collapse!” I will give conservatives credit for one thing, they are masters at branding, and when they branded the greedy rich as “job creators”, it gave them sympathy they certainly don’t deserve."

spiritofjosh,"Stop taxing those making below a certain amount and tax more to those above it. Call it communism, call it whatever you want but they can afford it easier. 

I filed my taxes and my tax return was 700 something and I work 50-60 hours a week. I sold some stuff on eBay throughout the year and they’re policy changed to if you sell over $600 you are now taxed as a “business owner.” I sold extra guitar gear to help make some extra cash and because of that my entire tax return went to paying the taxes on my “eBay business” that doesn’t actually exist. I was relying on that return to help pay my bills. The ultra-wealthy can live without a 3rd yacht or 4th oceanside property by paying more in taxes than I, and millions of others, have to."
Frequent_Succotash52,"The saddest thing to come out of this is people still believing they can put all the blame on Republican or Democrat Party leaders. Which ever Party you believe in has had enough power at times to change who pays what tax. You will read all sorts of blame game ideas going on in posts here. The Democratic Party has many wealthy leaders were they, their families, and friends benefit from the current tax system, plus they love the power wielded by the tax hammer. Powerful lobbying in both parties heavily influence the narrative also.

crypt0_sports,"Something definitely needs to change. Be it how we allow corporations to structure, minimize tax liability and the rest. There are ways to do this within the framework of current law.

The political will to do it is simply lacking because the politicians are paid off. 

I am sure if someone actually ran on a ticket that exposed corporate greed and the price we all are paying they would win elections and start a movement.

The real challenge would be them actually receiving media coverage since that would be against their own interests."

This isn't even hyperbole or fantasy - we have 30 years of radio (and television/cable) programming coinciding with campaign messaging that illustrates the problem.

Wolverine-75009,"“Since 1981, the Republicans have made cutting taxes the centerpiece of their economic policy. Forty years of so-called supply-side economics have demonstrated that this system does not, in fact, create extraordinary economic growth. Instead, it moves wealth upward, really quite dramatically, and creates deficits. Indeed, one of the reasons we need an increase in the debt ceiling is that the 2017 Trump tax cuts, especially the cut in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, dramatically increased the deficit without promoting growth. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2018 that the tax cuts would increase the deficit by about $1.9 trillion over 11 years.” HCR.

Increase revenue is historically the first option."

Not big enough to hide money in real estate, small enough that raising wages actually does hurt.  We get sandwiched in the middle and pay everything.

AmbitionIndividual24,"It truly is a shame - The divide in this country and the absolute idiocy from both ends of the spectrum.  The far right is just as guilty as the far left for the absolute ridiculous beliefs and how hard they stand on those beliefs.  Civil debate?  Nope, no facts are wanted here it's not allowed.    


Facts are a difficult thing to believe when they go against the narrative.  That narrative is designed to keep dems hating reps and vice versa.  This article is an excellent example of exactly that.  There is a bit of truth in the article, however it is twisted into something false.    


The debt in this country is out of control.  It is very complex and no, unfortunately, taking all of the rich people's money won't solve that problem.  No, reducing the tax burden also won't serve that problem.  Unfortunately, neither side wants to hear that.  Both parties have added to the debt.   Look at facts, I promise, they won't hurt you.  


The major problem is exactly this:  Who is this out of control spending really benefiting?  Does it benefit American citizens, or is there some profit to be had?  You may be surprised to find that (as Lawrence Lessig describes), our elections come after the lesters have chosen their candidates.  Once you realize that the Lobby, funding both sides of the aisle, are holding the purse strings, you may realize that neither party truly really matters.  They talk a big talk to get you to believe what they want.  When they actually write bills and pass them, the benefactors are the ones who elected them.   The government cannot spend itself out of debt, and class warfare is not the answer.  The government can, and does, spend itself into wealth for the lobby, the lesters."

Successful-Cash5047,"We need to do 3 things, we need to completely abolish the cap on social security and Medicare (where you only pay on the first $175K). We need to raise the maximum capital gains tax, and we need to tax large personal loans taken out against capital, that allow billionaires to get around paying the measly capital gains rate. 

We need to raise the maximum capital gains tax. Conservatives will say that the tax percentage doesn’t matter since the US government hasn’t ever gotten more than 20% of GDP in taxes, and will cite the ambiguous “laffer curve”, while neglecting to mention that the highest capital gains tax tier was only ~30%. Remember this is a tax that is only paid when they cash out. 

A large (arguably more important/effective) way to tax the ultra wealthy would be to tax large personal loans taken out against capital at rates similar to capital gains.  Currently rather than cashing out their stock they’ll just take out loans against it at a good market rate, even assuming 5%, that’s still a LOT cheaper than the 15-20% capital gains tax. If my theoretically proposed “capital hedge” tax of ~10% was in effect that money would actually go to the people instead of whatever bank they’re perpetually borrowing from. 

Finally, we need to completely abolish the cap on social security and Medicare, it’s completely ridiculous that you only pay toward that for the first 175,000 you make, there are electrical engineers that pay more toward social security and Medicare than some billionaires, think about that."

GuyJClark,"For years, I've envisioned an income tax structure that taxed the uber-wealthy at 50% and the poor 0%.  

The curve of percent tax vs income would be somewhat ""S"" shaped.  The 25% level would be at the median income level.  From there down, the percent taxation would drop in a smooth curve, the asymptote of which would either reach 0% at the poverty level, or even go through zero, so that the poorest people would not be taxed, but get money to live on.  

Going the other direction up from 25%, would asymptote up to 50%, so that a millionaire might be paying 40%, but a billionaire would be paying up to 50%.  There would have to be a great deal of thought put into this so that loopholes were eliminated.  

If the billionaires put the money back into their companies, for R&D, for upgraded equipment, and other things that not only make for better products, but more energy efficient processes, and otherwise ""greener"" production that would be allowed.  

Another way the business owners could avoid some of the taxes is to put some of the money back into their workforce, giving them raises, bonuses, etc., just like the management class does presently.

There used to be a concept called ""Noblesse Oblige""  which meant that the upper class had an obligation to help those less fortunate than themselves.  Bill Gates is a modern example of this concept.  In the past Andrew Carnegie, and others whose names I've forgotten, likewise donated large sums of money towards charitable organizations, building public works, buildings, endowing major artistic organizations, etc.  This has to come back into play!

My two cents (about all I have left from my last paycheck ;-) )..."

Last-Of-My-Kind,"And also cut spending. 

The amount of money this country spends is crazy."
ProRussian1337,"There is a reason we stopped taxing them that way - it didn't work. It seems that there is a magic percentage of GDP the US government is able to get from taxation no matter how high or low the taxes are in general. When they raised them to literally over 90% back in the day - it didn't work, most rich people simply found ways around it, and as a result they noticed a visible reduction in investment activity from the rich, which was part of getting away from the taxes. So the government did not make any more money this way, but the economy was actually getting hurt. This is why Kennedy - yes, that Kennedy, a democrat, actually lowered taxes by a lot and as a result, tax revenues actually went up, and business investment went up. So the moral of the story is, you have to find ways of taxing that are never extreme enough to cause the rich to try to flee, if the taxes are low enough, they'll just pay it and move along, but if you raise them too much, the rich will just find ways to flee, and you're left holding the bag with no more money."
Topher-22,"The top 1% pay 40% of all federal income taxes.   

The bottom 50% pay 3% of federal income taxes.  

I think a lot of people miss that fact.
