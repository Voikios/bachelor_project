Cataklysim_,After seeing it on this years AGDQ it’s definitely something I will get to play on the switch. Well done!
Beneficial-Pen-9693,"I play this on my steamdeck, saw your post a while back and really enjoy the game. Easy fun that honestly doesn’t feel too repetitive, good job dude!"

cashibonite, doom / quake inspired it seems with a pg twist.
HaliaIvory,Didn't Barberous King play this on Twitch yesterday?
Bytrsweet,"As a gamer in my early 40's this game definitely takes me back, it looks fun.  One thing I have to ask, is the gun at the beginning some sort of retrofitted sewing machine?"
Doomslayer5150,"Congratulations:)
I love the style.

Reminds me of Duke Nukem 3D
And Ion Fury. 

Can't wait to play it on my switch"
expatdo2insurance,"As I kid I dreamed of growing corn on the moon. Kids are fucking stupid.

I don't know where I was going with this."
CATitute,ive been meaning to try this since the zero punctuation review. Grats on getting to consoles.
Pilo_ane,"I played it on PC and generally liked it. It has some defects of design tho. I'd say that the main problem is that in some moments you need to constantly switch weapon to adjust to every kind of enemy. When you're fighting multiple people it becomes a problem, it's not fluid and intuitive. I think you could have been a little less rigid on this, and make enemies vulnerable to more (or all) guns. Maybe take less damage, but still vulnerable. As it is now, it makes some sections very frustrating. I've seen this is the most common criticism"
ItsMorbinTime,Have you seen Pootie Tang?
OmegaAngelo,Steam?
MediaNatural7819,Why is reddits video player so fucking ass. It never works.
waterGammaFoxtrot,"""As a poor, quadriplegic kitten gamer with Down's syndrome from the Bronx that believes politics doesn't belong in games I dreamed of one day making up a story to get free advertisement as a media manager for a gaming company, and today, reddit, I demand your money."""
Competitive-Stuff607,\#ad
atjones111,Just me or did I see this years ago?
ttubehtnitahwtahw1,Ad
IM_INSIDE_YOUR_HOUSE,I thought blatant advertisements were against the sub rules but maybe I’m thinking of another subreddit.
JakeHodgson,"Fucking adddddsssssssssss. 

At least make the fake comments believable. ""Doom/quake inspired with a PG twist."" 🤓 hell yeah. Doesn't sound like a fed line at all. I don't even know how that one makes sense anyway."
crunchypuddle,"I can't begin to care about the shitty games people astroturf here.

They genuinely all look the same to me at this point. See you in 6 months when you repost this again OP. 

""A FEW YEARS AGO I QUIT MY JOB TO PURSUE MY *DREAM* OF MAKING A LOW POLY 5 HOUR LONG GAME THAT I CAN SPAM IN LARGE REDDIT GAMING SUBS""

(Not an exaggeration, this 20 dollar game takes you 5 hours to beat... less actually for just main story)"

Marcus_Krow,Looks better than Forespoken.
Abrez25,"*He has a dream.*

Can't comment on the game as I haven't played it but this is free advertisement, nothing more nothing less. 

Whoever thinks otherwise is delusional."
magicpantsyeet,This was not released today
flyingdonkeydong69,"I remember seeing the same post made back in August of 2022, when you first released the game...

Granted, it was only for Steam back then, but you used the same ""Today I released my dream game!"" title you used on this post.

I don't want to shit on independent people making cool games with decent designs, good plots, or niche but fun concepts, but using the same initial announcement title for your 6-month-old game's console compatibility? Clickbait-y, man."
articice01,Looks mediocre. Stop spamming your ads
omg_Enrico_Palazzo,This dude has been shamelessly marketing this game on reddit for years and his dream has changed quite frequently...
Standard-Assist-5793,love the way this sub is just a giant advertising board now.
AlphaOwn,Kinda dickish how indie devs leverage these communities for free advertisement slots and do nothing to even denote them properly or be transparent about it
ballsucker69696969,Is the game free
Icy_Jury1766,Why are ads allowed here?
DaMacPaddy,Re-post this when it is on sale for $1.99
heilspawn,Looks like a Doom WAD for Hotline Miami
Reeleted,Hehe it has zoomer words and memes!
RedBullAndWeed,/r/gaming sure loves unpaid ads dude
CharlesIngalls_Pubes,"Bro I remember when you made the steam announcement, but couldn't remember the name of the game. Super fucking stoked for you, my friend! Going to purchase on the PS right now."
Albert_McPimp,"That game looks so Fucking shit, even for a shameless ad it’s disappointing"
Germanspartan15,"So tired of these solicitation posts masquerading as legitimate stories.

The game looks cool and I enjoyed the GDQ run, but seriously this advertising is getting over the top. Seems like every day one of the top posts is another game ad hidden behind some feel-good story."
geye6e6e,"""Your game looks like it was created with a potato""

""Nah dude it's retro!""

""So you *wanted* it to play poorly and look shitty?""

""Basically"""
PyramidWater,Looks really… dumb!  Good luck tho! Maybe sell a couple or few
PabloSRT8,Was that Singer sewing machine at the beginning? lol
Draijan,Oh yay another shitty sprite game with particle effects that block 85% of the screen.
Frantb,Too bad it's not a better game.
Butsenkaatz,"Came here to mention Danejerus' run on AGDQ, best Speedrun of the entire event, no doubt.  


Thank you for making this game, and therefore, that run possible <3"
thecoolestjedi,Yay a new game to shill
cakeharry,Doesn't look like it has anything to do with the name...
Realistic-Dot6141,Saw gmans video on this it looks wild
EMEYDI,My god that looks so fun !!
wellrundry2113,Looks super fun. The code name: Flamer though…
Michaelwaisjr,Congratulations!!!!!!!
theodore_j_detweiler,"Isn't there some sort of rule against posting ads here? Game would've been cool 10 years ago btw, you've got some catching up to do"
_tsuujin,I wish the video didn’t pan away after every shot. I think something other than killing is happening with those guns but the video never stays around long enough for me to see what happens after the huge particle effects.
Aggravating-Duck2883,"Congratulations on a achieving a dream, must feel great. All the best with the game."
smokewidget,That’s awesome! Been wanting to play this ever since I saw Yahtzee give it a positive review earlier this year. Game sounded hilarious and the art style on this looks incredible! Can’t wait to pick it up!

extrafarts44,Congratulation on the release!◝(ᵔᵕᵔ)◜
UniversalCombustor,"That's cool, congrats! i'll try it when i have time i think.

As a kid i wished i'd have a device to play games without it being static like a PC

after getting a mobile phone i ended up having headaches when i play for a while so it was better with a nintendo switch because it didn't seem to have that effect. if i want to play a mobile game i use bluestacks recently, i'm impressed with the new updates. but if i wanna go outside i always have my switch with me"
