ConradIronmonger,"100m+

Every weapon completely silent at this point

Edit: since this comment get to many upvotes i think i should make it more informative. Different suppressed guns have different volume level, for example: VSS is super quiet, really hard to tell even a direction of a shot, while SVD is opposite, it's really easy to pin point position of a shooter despite it being suppressed. But, fun fact, as soon as both guns would be more than 100m away from you - they become completely silent/unaudiable. And ammo being subsonic makes 0 difference, because game does not consider breaking sound barrier at all, this simply not implemented mechanic. In my opinion it's just lazy solution from the devs, because making it accurate to real world would take a lot of effort, so ""copy and paste 100m rule"" - done."
shiftyslayer22,You also have zero idea how far they are away? Could be 200m away?
Stase1,It shouldn’t be but you woulda died there even if it was clear
watzwatz,"Suppressers in this game are broken anyways.

1. No supersonic crack in some cases, even with supersonic ammo.
2. If you get shot at from certain angles, the audio is bugged and the gunshot is completely silent even from like 20m.
3. Even in those cases where the sound does work as intended, suppressors are idiotically quiet. I guess they pulled the audio from some James Bond movie."
iedy2345,"Might be true, but you were dead anyway caught in the open like that getting shot by one of the nastiest bullets in this game."
sheetpooster,Here we go again
Niitroglycerine,"I mean, you were dead regardless, not sure why your first though was about the bullet sound"
Dyils,"He is right. And some of you are right too.

Yes, the bullet will get to him before the sound of the gun.

But the round itself makes its own sound as it breaks the sound barrier.

That might not be able to properly tell you the exact direction of the shot because you'll hear the crackling of the round before it reaches you and after it passes you (so both sides). But it might give you a better idea of things nonetheless."
WibblyPunk,"this happened to me on streets earlier in the underground parking area, guy was using 9x21 and was no way he was 100m+

assumed it was a hacker tbh."
_CyberCide_,"Most ammo in Tarkov is supersonic, meaning you'll get hit with the bullet before even hearing the gunshot."
Dodge_Of_Venice,"Suppressors are totally broken in this game at 100m you dont hear anything even if they are firing supersonic ammo, one of the most annoying things when you have no clue where you are getting shot from despite it being supersonic ammo."
Zumbert,"Realism aside, for gameplay reasons I think they should just make suppressors incredibly rare.

The game is just so much more fun and alive when you hear gunfights off in the distance, I think its a major contributing factor to why early wipe is so much fun."
Taco_truckin,You can hear the gun but not the bullet whiz that’s weird
ApeOfDiamondz,There’s still an audio bug. Happened to me with BT
Yungterpintine,It’s not when they are near you… you have no clue where that guy is yet you proceed to find something to blame it on other than yourself. Maybe stay in a tree line and keep better positioning next time. So tired of this being a complaint sub for bad players.
DelugeFPS,"You were fucked regardless. Even if the guy was 30m to your right in a bush going full loud, you'd have been dead before you could've done anything. You went down in two shots and the first hit blacked out a leg, this situation kills you either way."
Scavwithaslick,"If it was far enough away that you couldn’t hear the suppressed gunshot it would still be supersonic, so all you would hear is a crack without direction. So it would actually be worse than what happened here"
jbed24,"not even a tasteful snap or a whizzing noise? this dude is actually 5 men across the map shooting subsonics or something, i refuse to believe audio is so screwed that one man was able to smite you down with complete silence"
sibleyy,"My biggest issue with the game is the degree to which bush camping is an uncounterable strategy. 

If you're traversing a map you basically just have to hope you don't get dicked down by a rat who is camping one of an infinite number of possible sight-lines. For the rat there is no risk - sit for 15 minutes, get a free kit, or extract and do it again.

The asymmetry of risk/reward is an issue."
MeadOfPoetryy,"People clearly don't understand what this is. There is no way unless you're cheating you're hitting someone from 100+m this consistently and rapidly. 

He was hit 7 times in less than a second! How could anyone even THINK this is 100m+????

What this is, is the player invisibility bug going around. Had the same thing except I had it with my squad mates. They could damage me, wouldn't hear a sound. No gun sounds when they shot, no items thrown on the ground, etc. etc. OP isn't bad, this is just a game-breaking bug and for some reason, people love to give BSG excuses for this mess. This latest patch was not tested in the slightest for QA, this is the shittiest patch they've ever put out and it's not even close. What a mess..."
ThisNameIsTakenWtf,"Might be a new bug, some people have been invisible for me since the last patch"
HuntinoBino,Bullshit you couldn’t hear him shooting but tbh he killed you before you woulda even been able to shoot back.
Core770,New audio enjoyer it seems. Turn it off for now
Plormby102,I think you can actually hear it very lightly
The_German_1,Lol you were dead within 1 second at the most. No audio was going to save you there.
kr3me,You were dead anyway hearing wouldn’t have saved you buddy
PutridAppointment69,"Maybe don’t walk out in the open on a map literally designed for sniping? The caliber being silent or not, you’d still be dead. You’re bad at this game."
RoboticControl187,I heard the bullets just no report of the gun. Seems he was a skilled shooter using an advantage position with the right optics at the right range and the best sound suppressor available. What more did you need to hear? I heard the bullets and even them ricochet you got shot from your right side but you where moving in the open with no cover or concealment. If he was unsuppressed it would likely have not made much difference.
MandiocaGamer,it was just a good kill. deal with it
Shpongled_Alien,"It’s tarkov what do you really expect? I stopped playing because tarkov no longer respects your time. There are too many bugs, glitches, exploits, hackers, desync, server issues, and overall balance problems that completely ruin the tarkov experience that we all used to know. I really want to love this game again, but damn does it not fuckin care."

YourAverageGiant6-6,"Yes it should. It's post like this, that show you people will bitch, and moan about anything. 

You don't even fucking know where he fired the shot. 

He could have been 200+ meters out. 

Wah I fucking died, the games at fault! It's not me! Big bad BSG made rifle fire from extreme distances quiet!

Fuck off."
Suspicious-Cucumber9,I'm ok with a ban of supressors in the traders.
MisterMagoooooo,"Oh my poor boy, you have no idea what you’re talking about"
Gullible_Cupcake3311,"It’s a glitch, games in beta for life what do you expect"
MootsUncle,"You got two-tapped from long-range, would it have really changed anything here if you heard the shot?"
undercoat27,You shouldn’t have been walking there
BukLauFinancial,No bullets should be silent unless they are subsonic and fired through a suppressor.
crpiecho,depending on the range it should be. had a fight yesterday on woods a pmc was using the 308 mdr and it wasnt registering his gunshot sounds and we were just 30m away from one another.
Scavwithaslick,Depends on the distance
brochochocho,"Yep. Died as a scav on woods in the medical
FOB, zero sound, just dropped dead."
ElegantAnything11,Subsonic ammo watching angrily from the sidelines as normal ammo steals it's nice traits daily
ghoths,"Is not about the bullet, is about the speed of the bullet.

The thing is! Even subsonic bullets shot of suppressors would make noise you could hear from a decent distance."
PandaDevelin,"I'm more scared when I hear an impact of a single bullet but no bang from a rifle, than 5 simultaneous full auto sprays paired with grenades."
L3AVEMDEAD,"Was getting shot by someone camping in some random parking garage corner on Interchange with a silenced MP7 not even a few feet away and I thought I was getting shot at from 60+ until he killed my friend, but didn't move. 

Suppressors are so damn nice for solo play but sometimes it's just too much...."
Trickabounce,There was a glitch yesterday where my friend could not hear any of our groups during our guns. He had to clear cache in launcher to fix
Tomur,"Unless you thought the sound would save you, you were dead by the first shot.

[You also wouldn't hear the shots, just the ricochet and bullets going past your head like you do in the video depending on distance.](https://youtu.be/bDBqD5Lck-c)"
Blizzpoint,He used a pillow to kill you
SilentReavus,Yeah the fact that there's a 100m sound cutoff is more than a little ridiculous.
ImJoogle,im still getting killed by totally silent grenades as well as people point blank in front of me being silent
bradford342,Yea. If it isn't subsonic you would still hear the crack of the bullet traveling through the air. It wouldn't be that quiet UNLESS it was subsonic.
Dentalswarms,Eh it kind of sucks being shot at by suppressors just keep note of the closest 360 (or good enough)degree cover. I don't think there in need of change though
Hawkadoodle,"Tbh with u, they say you always hear the cracks when you are getting shot at. They never tell you that if you get hit by the bullet you don't hear the Crack because your body goes into shock. Kinda survivor ship bias."
Zc9-Holden,servers are fucked.i ll post something about it now.its not the gun its servers
That_Investigator815,.308 is pretty damn quiet Irl
abramthrust,"Neither should a door opening on the other side of a waist-high dresser, but hey that's Tarkov sound!"
SGTWAffles98,"Definitely shot from distance. Could hear the ""bang"" after the bullets hit you."
PresidentFungi,7.62x51 should be quieter than 5.56
StartingReactors,I think the sounds of your painful death drowned out what little sounds there was. Clearly a long shot because the sound and the bullet hitting you seem to be out of sync.
Alone_Manufacturer66,"I was in a raid on shoreline north of village  and was shooting at a pmc in the village and my akm was not making any sound, even to me, but I was hitting the pmc. Later in the raid it was making noise properly tho."
janivkk,My 3-man died today 5 secs into the raid on customs. Absolute piss take but fair play.
Kiiidx,Okay but if you’re going out with a nice m4 at least bring a goldenstar in your pouch and some food so you can use it all raid when you’re walking out in the open and can at least react
SAKilo1,"Unless, yah know, they were suppressed at range."
somenoefromcanada38,"This is the invisible player bug, you were killed by a player that didn't exist for you. happened to me a few times."
Conserliberaltarian,"FYI, THIS IS A BUG. It has to do with the Invisible PMC bug that's going on right now that causes all footstep and gunshots audio to be silent."
Bradur-iwnl-,You complain about the audio of gunfire even though it made no difference?
Dirtydantheman95,"I’ve had multiple times I’ve died and only had my guy grunt, no bullet impacts no bullet whizzing by. Just dying"
pepa-pig-ultimate,Could be a glitch. Some of my friends are invisible to me and their gunshots are dead silent.
ShockDropZ_95,Theres also a massive desync bug right now that causes players to be invisible. I went into a 4 man raid yesterday and some of our team couldn't see other team mates. Not the same person either. Like person A couldnt see person c and person b couldnt see person a. We found that with this bug active you couldnt hear an invisible persons shots but they could still damage you if they shot you.
flomeista,"even if it wasn't silent, it's super sonic so you would be dead before you hear it anyway"
aymenshatti,"Might also be the invisible PMC bug, I had this happen to me today, a trio partner of mine as invisible to me and so we're enemies, when I got shot he was less than 50 metres in front but he was invisible and his gun made no noise, I just took damage and died"
,Subsonic means it doesn’t get near the sound barrier. You’re supposed to use subsonic rounds with a silencer. These combined get rid of the snap. Without the subsonic rounds the silencer helps add spin and velocity to the bullet due to the longer barrel. The snap would still be present.
chemiculs,skill issue
IIIKitsuneIII,"I dunno what the issue is, there were distinct shots in that clip. They were suppressed but, still there."
medkitjohnson,As far as worst places to walk on shoreline goes… thats probably top 2. And it aint 2…
BITM116,"Just posted a similar clip the other day, absolute silence until the second shot. Only realized there was a first because my PMC winced and my screen blurred."
Ok_Gas_6906,Even if you heard the gunshots it still wouldn’t have helped your case sadly
Capnshredder,"Does BSG just not understand that a big peice of metal flying past you at supersonic speed makes a super loud fucking noise?? even if the round passes 15 feet away its still going to be very obvious someone just fired at you, so why this bs now?"
PoisedPigeon,"Happened to me today, on woods walking in aine and my chest just takes 50% from nowhere and my guy groans. 

No crack no zip no impact noise. Guy comes up to where I was and eventually kills me and he has a suppressed SKS I think."
Millsey--,"OP the type of Tarkov player that just will never ever be satisfied. Will always find something to complain about, especially when they die. Extra Salty pmc boy."
vio212,Bullet from any rifle at distance doesn’t have any noise until the bullet is past you.  Speed of sound is a bitch.
Francoa22,"it’s tarkov dude…u either play with 10000 pieces of unfairness and issues, or you dont. Expecting thing to become realistic is naive. It is RPG..there are parts realistic, but majority is not"
Puzzled_Inflation_95,"No it shouldn't at all but people Wana say 7.62x 54r should be shit to and I don't get it .
Cry baby's"
ProfetF9,"I’m a new player, semi pro csgo/apex/halo player in my gaming day and i just want to say: WTF IS THE AUDIO IN THIS GAME?!?!??"
vinevicious,"if he was far enough you would die before hearing anything

edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFsR6KfSAgk

you probably should hear the hypersonic crack while you die, and definitely hear for every shot close by"
Slow-Ad7343,"1. I dont think the comment section have actually used a suppressor in irl, which probably should be the case and is okay. 

2. Irl they are pretty much silent unless you’re within 50-75m depending how much powder is in the bullet and the quality of the supressor. 

3. Tarkov isn’t perfect but it’s pretty damn close to mimicking the physics of the supressor sounds. You can only do so much with the framework they’ve built."
Brittfield,All the worst parts of gaming in one game. Not sure why ppl play. I played a half of a season and want a refund :/
abrectant,You can very clearly hear the gun cracking through the suppressor. Dude was probably 200+ meters away.
FEIKMAN,"just died 30min ago on a scav run with my buddy to a raider, that was shooting at us from god knows where, no gun shots, nothing. We both just dropped. 

As always with BSG - 1 step forward, 2 steps back."
Spacezone229,I agree but if it wasn't the same outcome would've happened.  Your just picking on a smaller issue that had almost nothing to do with your death.
allamerican37,Sadly suppressed or non suppressed. You were dropped. Happens. Welcome to Tarkov.
