KalIsSatisfactorized,"Looks really good!  When I first saw the posts about the Lego constructor and pictures a while ago, I looked into purchasing the pieces to put one together, but the cost was pretty crazy.  If you don't mind me asking, which site did you order from, and how did it set you back?"
houghi,"Looks great. Now build the other 12 743 and then start with the constructors. ;-)


It would be crazy to see the whole map in e.g. Legoland with all the hundreds and even thousands of machines. I can not even try to imagine what that would cost."
