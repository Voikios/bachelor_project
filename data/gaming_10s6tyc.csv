Bushcant,The PS2 will always hold a special place in my heart.
FuturisticPlethora,"The good old days of couch multi-player games


Edit: I never expected this to get so many ups. Thanks everyone!"
flinjager123,I still have my Dreamcast. I need to deyellow it one day.
Serikan,"I always loved the Gamecube's Easter Egg on startup

Hold Z"
GaugeWon,"Dreamcast might be the most underrated system of all time.  The mini-game-storage-carts, and arcade-exact-graphics blew my mind, but it's timing was just a shade too late to compete financially.  Somebody should do a documentary about how Sega blew it... 

I was so jealous when my friend got one, but I just bought my ps2, and had kids, so...

edit:  Shoutout to everybody who gave me some new viewing material

SmoothOperator89,Everyone's golden age of gaming is whenever they were 8 to 12 years old.
Okan_Zokamee,So many good memories from this era
Large_Cube_Unaligned,That is because you were a child. You are no longer a child.
32mafiaman,I have the PS2 startup sound engraved in my brain
Kozzzman,SNES/Genesis/Game Boy/Turbo Grafx 16
WTFswedish,"facebook head ass post
‚Äòmember when this were differentüéÆ"
Coast_watcher,The golden era was whenever you were a kid. No surprise.
khamelean,"Well you can still play all of those now, as well as thousands of modern releases. By any objective measure, now is a better time for gaming :)"
llwonder,Nostalgia is one hell of a drug
xtrathicc4me,"No, you just grow old."
Either-Plant4525,I think 360/ps3/wii was probably better but I did enjoy being able to play couch games
HaikuBotStalksMe,"Super Nintendo vs Sega Genesis was more interesting. 

The current generation is the best because you can still play all the old games and the new ones."
imgrandojjo,When the Four Nations lived in harmony.
Solid_Snake_Killua,I really loved my N64 and all the games I had on it.
AramaticFire,"This era was wild, despite Dreamcast‚Äôs early demise in 2001. This was the start of modern gaming and was absolutely nuts. 

Every platform had its own identity and every game, including established series felt brand new.

We‚Äôve mostly been iterating on what was done in this era."
Give-Valk-Acog,Back when the plan for making money was to make a game as fun as possible
SuperstinkyBurps,I am guessing you were around 16 when these consoles came out?
B33fh4mmer,"Soul Caliber on Dreamcast was the first time that a home console produced better graphics than its arcade version. 

What a time in history of gaming. I still believe the dreamcast was ahead of its time and should gave launched with the next generation. Sega Sports have ALWAYS been better than EA."
burgerpatrol,"I love this gen. Not because of nostalgia, but because many of the games released during this era developed games with the idea of 'easy to get into, hard to master' template of arcade games. The most cinematic game I can think of back then was the God of War and Halo series, and GoW still provided a modern day take in beat-em ups (along with Yakuza). Halo was fun as hell as well. JRPGs were always cinematic though. 

It also felt like most of the games during this era were developed around the gameplay and not around the story, no progression system except for RPGs, cool extra modes (create a map in Timesplitters for instance, dunk contest in NBA Live), arcade-like gameplay (SSX, Tony Hawk, etc.).

Lastly, I don't know but games released during this era felt complete and had a lot of replayability. Fighting games, JRPGs, Sports, Adventure, and Platformers were really at their peak during this time."
Wikadood,Ps2 and GameCube games were built different
ElysianBlight,"Harvest Moon, Chibi Robo, all the Zelda games ..
Game Cube probably gave me the happiest times of my life"
jhwalk09,Dreamcast? It was discontinued before the Xbox and GameCube even came along
MidniteMustard,"Too old for backwards compatibility, too new for re-releases."
InterestingRelative4,NINTENDO SNES GENESIS N64 GANG
Duhmoan,"That was the golden era for couch play and split screen.


The 360 had the best online experience though to date."
GingerBuffalo,"NES classic changed my life. Had played Atari at friends, had an Intellivision set in the mid 80s. When NES introduced Super Mario Brothers, Duck Hunt, Legend of Zelda, and the massive game content that would come out over the years it felt like something truly new had started."
Bloon82,Put some respect on the N64 ü§úüèª
emceelokey,Last era when they actually tried to put out games that were finished on shelves. 360/PS3 era was decent but that when annualized games with minimal improvements started happening and has been nothing but downhill since
-Pooped-,SNES best for RPGS
DarlokSpies,Try DOS
bobsmirnoff86,"PlayStation, N64 and Xbox was the golden generation of consoles.

I'll argue that no console has it had a better multiplayer setup than the n64"
RavenQuark,Mario TTYD üëë
ominix,When games were complete products and did not have microtransactions
DamnImAwesome,People say the same thing about music. The truth is we‚Äôre in the golden era of gaming and music right now. Mainstream AAA stuff is trash but we have access to more games (including the old ones we love). There are more game devs than ever before. There truly is a game for everyone.
X0718379,Nostalgia posts are braindead. Games have gotten way better.
GBNDias,"Look. Im a millenial too and I have awesome memories with this consoles (mine was Ps2).

But we have to realize those games were at least horrible for today standards. The good memories were associated to childhood and/or playing with friends side by side instead of online.

I still have my PS2 and some times I turn it on for 1 or 2 hours for nostalgia but the games were so bad that I quickly go back to my Xbox Series."
Steph-Kai,"Sega Mega Drive baby!
(That's the Genesis for American viewers)"
SumRumHam,Developers were incentivised to put out a complete game because there is no going back and fixing it later. No DLC just the whole game.
_-DEVGRU-_,"TRUE GOLDEN ERA OF GAMING ‚ú®

-SUPER NES
-SEGA GENESIS
-N64
-SONY PLAYSTATION 

‚Ä¶Change my mind‚ÄºÔ∏è"
McWeen,So you are mid to late 30s?
polsar188,"The golden age of gaming is subjective.
Everyone's golden age is the era they have the fondest memories of, and they are all valid and correct."
himynameisyoda,the pc games as well.
dub_life,Idk my man I think we're living in it RN.  PS4 and PS5 w the Xboxes and Super Wiis.  2023 is da bomb.
Sinonyx1,"""what i grew up with was the best."""
Beautiful_Exam_1464,"I grew up on SNES, N64, PS1. I was a teenager during the the Ps2/Xbox generation. In my twenties, it was the 360 era. The 360 era was the greatest. This is why the games form that period are being remastered ad nauseam."
Sir_Rated,"Ps2 was the console that refused to die. 

It was also the pinnacle of fun, couch co-op"
Spacebud95,"PS2 is the GOAT imo. Top tier games, PS1 backwards compatibility, could stand it vertically. Good shit through and through. If it had Halo on it then it wouldn't even be a competition."
carbonatedshark55,"I don't know, man. This was still at a time when gaming was seen as childish and a men's only club. If you ask me, the 70s and early 80s were the golden age just because gaming was more inclusive and every game was unique. I will say that the early 2000s was a time where 3D games (gta 3 and halo) really showed their full potential, and the PS2 is at one of the top 3 game consoles of all time."
kynthrus,Just remembered the gamecube startup sound and now I'm deaf.
Niliks,I can still head the PS2 Dive and the Game Cube Roll
N7Longhorn,Agreed
Knighthawk235,I miss that era of gaming!
triscuitsrule,Replace Dreamcast with Nintendo game boy and yes.
LouisVonHagen,I respectfully disagree. The PS3/Wii/Xbox 360 days were truly the greatest age and I've been gaming since NES. Longest gen consoles and they had the games to prove it. So many improvements to graphics during that one generation  that really showed what the hardware could do. Abundance and quality of games too. I've been pretty disappointed with the ps4/Xbox one generation.
forkandspoon2011,"Saturn, 64, and PS1 for me."
TheZoomba,The ps2 was so powerful. I believe that thing could power a supercomputer
Sector7B,God I miss og Xbox.
DrooMighty,"This image perfectly sums up my middle school experience, that one brief stretch where all 4 of these consoles existed simultaneously. Good times..."
xXKingDadXx,"Dreamcast was the GOAT my brothers and I played the ever loving shit out of that console, it was the perfect couch co-op system.

It also had some sort of flaw where it was super easy to copy games, my dad would take us to the flea market and we would go to this guy's named John's booth where he sold games for $5 a piece. We had a CD binder full of games. Good times."
