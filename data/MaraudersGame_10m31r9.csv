huffmultiple,"Always be mindful of what screen you open crates/drops on! As you saw when you switch between Trade and Gear screens any open crates/drops are lost. 

You could have moved some stuff from one of the backpacks into your ship and made room for the mg42 too which is a damn shame"

Yamm_Yamm,"Good to know. I always have some Med. Crates at hand, cause they usually take up less space than their contents. 

Still hope this gets fixed somehow in the future. It's really frustrating when you open a container and can't make room for the loot."
