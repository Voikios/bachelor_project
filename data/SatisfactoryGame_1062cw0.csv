FunOpportunity7,"Perfect excuse for some exceptional engineering (superglue)!

Side note, sorry it got broke"
EidolonRook,"Ironic. It says ficsit on the side like they are instructions!  Maybe repair it with gold, I mean caterium."
Danbert1_0,Ficsit
foxtrot419,Imminent destruction of FICSIT property detected.
cheztir,"Fell a foot or so into the sink while washing it. Sad to see it go after waiting so long for the pre-order and only having it for a month or so.

I'd like to replace it, does anyone know if LizardDoggo's quality has improved? Or any alternatives? I was very disappointed in this one's quality but still love the idea."
Jannomag,"And I thought it’s an enamel cup, poor merch quality"
lilibat,"RIP

I will pour some coffee out for her."
too_late_to_abort,Depending on the break you can superglue this pretty seamlessly. Maybe glue it and put it up somewhere? A decoration is better use of it than trash.

Anonim97,"It looks like one of these [old metal cups from the 70s](https://i.imgur.com/cNSZmdf.png), yet it's ceramics. Huh."
EmperorOfJustice,"I don't understand why they didn't just make the cup from sheeted metal, like it is in the game. Would be so much more durable too."
Gunk_Olgidar,Awwww...
