TarkovBirdman,Just high enough to break your leg so you canâ€™t run away. Feels bad.

AudioCinematic,"The side effect of this is you lose all your loot but it did get me to the main menu instantly. Shame I clipped through that opening but it was still funny when it happened.  
  
Edit: Here's a clip of me intentionally falling through the wide open grate even by slowly backing up to the hole (opposed to just dropping in). It drops you instantly yet you can see in this clip I drop much slower because I clipped through the grate at an angle. I blame myself for even wasting time on this nonsense. It's my own fault at this point lol.

[Here's an image from the original clip that literally shows me clipping through it as if the slow I dropped being pushed through wasn't enough lol. I clipped through the angled grate and the metal bar before the wide open hole.](https://i.imgur.com/dRasSPz.png)"
FlatAd768,The train has no timer countdown to leaving right? It just leaves after I think 3 minutes in the station?
