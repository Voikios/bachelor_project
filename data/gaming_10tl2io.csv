Korobito,My eyes burn
SolitaryMan305,Looks like a mobile game
passinghere,"Surprised there's not already a Ready Player One quote about the usual comment

> We have determined that we'll be able to fill 80% of the user's display with advertising before inducing seizures‚Äù proudly proclaims Nolan"
Historical-Cap5006,"How is it cluttered? You can clearly see that cashshop functions and currency, its all what matters in that genre"
greeder41,"Posting an image and not referencing what game it‚Äôs from should be illegal. 

Happens non-stop on this sub. It‚Äôs not that hard to be considerate of others. For fuck sake."
TsumeYifu,Oh sweet child. Back in my day during 40man raids we did that to ourselves. As a healer the only thing I could really see was the ground so I wouldn't stand in red stuff.
Bergfurgaler,"Ive noticed that Japanese made games are getting bad about this. Putting active time event gauges smack dead center. quest tracker with 7 unfinished quests in bullet point on the side, bloated party list with HP MP CP GP and AP gauges for each player WITH artistic portraits and goofy icons that no one actually understands. and all the unnecessary dialog that they do mid fight is of course subtitled too."
high240,"This is what I see when looking at WoW type game-screenshots.

No idea what is going on lmao and no idea how people who play the game know what's going on lmao"
Wulfbayne1066,Hopefully OP knows what it is
Zelidus,Every twitch streamers video
Mr_Multiverse,What game is this?
,This looks quiet compared to my early WOW days üòÇ
IncestGiraffe,Looks like a Mobile Game.
Sagan-Man,\*laughs in WoW\*
braize6,And still looks cleaner than a World of Warcraft player's UI
Sleepless-Shuttle,The controls being a cluster on the left screams mobile game but it's bound to a keyboard which makes how big the controls are somewhat pointless since you don't have to press the screen. Really just bad design.
schn4GGy,*laughs in WoW UI mods*
Zapfox6207,Ain't no way your even having fun playing that
uhnioin,"It's insane how many Genshin ""jokes"" there are in this thread when Genshin's UI looks nothing like this."
Icemilk-Magic,"For all those curious, the game is Summoner's War: Chronicles.  
Fairly new, just came out early this past November.  


I played it for a bit but my AuDHD ass can only handle so much. The one saving grace of the cluttered AI is that there are auto buttons for most of the quests/sidequests/dungeons. There are only some instances of manual play being required. Eventually you do need to manual harder content though, just cause the auto-play isn't quite \*that\* smart."
Cr1ms0nSlayer,What in the genshin knockoff
poptartjake,The entire left portion is easily mistaken as a desktop....
AustinSlayer227,"Half of this could just be moved into an info menu, you don‚Äôt need all of your extra icons in the gameplay"
5_meng___o,that sensory overload
BwGT,So every mmorpg?
Wulfbayne1066,It does look like a mobile game but it's on pc. I've no idea what game it is though
SuperSlims,Games this terrible should be illegal
LouSayners,Yuck
RushRoidGG,And yet people will pump so much money into them anyways.
LiterallyAidan1,hey is this how you get karma
Newguyiswinning_,What you get for a mobile game
Muscalp,Just recently started ghost of tsushima and admired how the minimal HUD is concealed 99% of the time. This is the opposite of that.
Ryash913,What in the f2p hell is this ??
NeedsMoreBunGuns,Oh god my eyes!
No_Set_9593,What in the mobile gaming
shiroininja,This is why I don‚Äôt play mobas
Voidstrider2230,It's a shitty mobile game what did you expect?
Manabauws,These predatory games should be illegal.
ShoerguinneLappel,it looks like a Genshin Ripoff.
Apprehensive_Foot139,There's a game in your hud
GoofyTunes,Looks like a genshin clone
AriusArmarchusVT,The most decluttered WoW screen.
Luc4_Blight,If the rest of the game is garbage why would the UI be any different?
TerrorLTZ,Genshin impact Copycat game N¬∞ 403
homeless0alien,"Its because its a mobile game port, they have all the icons on screen for touch screen playability."
cy13erpunk,mobile gaming garbage
IIIdeletedIII,Mobile game trash

46692,Won‚Äôt stop people on this sub from pogging out at the next newest money pit game.
The_household_PG,What game is that?
SaintAvalon,Looks like a free to play mobile game.
PK_RocknRoll,I thought this was a photo of a PC desktop for a sec
DumDumIdjit,As a WoW player i still see plenty of space.
xroalx,"That's on you for playing Cashgrab Simulator Mobile Online Extreme XXX5 Forever Ultimate, or whatever these games go by these days."
WillyFF7,"Dunno how it has keyboard pc hotkeys,  definitely looks like any ""mobile mmo"" ... pretty against those as a mmo fan. I tried to like and want them at first but it's not a good idea. They should try better in vr"
TakuiXD,"Truthfully by today's standards, seems very normal. I've seen older games with worse UI than this here. So long as the game allows for you to customize the UI to your liking then that is perfectly fine, the devs aren't obligated to make everything to one person's liking regarding how UI is placed in a game like this. I've seen lots of people complain about UI like this but never customize the settings to better suit them, why? Laziness. As long as the base settings allow for playability fully where it's placed, how much stuff is on screen usually don't matter as lots of games especially mobile have too many features and most of the time it's better to directly be able to access them on screen at any given time. Point is if you can customize it, do so, 95% games at least those I have played allow you to do so, unless there's a specific reason to have the UI set in a specific way. I agree most mobile games are trash, but I've never had to complain that UI was so bad and cluttered, that it's a problem. Features that have no use to me get removed off screen or opacity set to 0 and size 0, then moved to a spot I won't touch."
DiamondRoller37,"I was thinking ‚Äúthis is fine, you need to press the buttons‚Äù and then I realized that *it wasn‚Äôt a mobile game.* Definitely way too cluttered"
Mlyrin,"This is a gripe i have with mobile mmos. The ui blocks the view of what is already blocked ny a million explosions created by other players and a raid boss that takes half the screen.

  That's when i uninstalled. (‚Å†‚òûÔæü‚Å†‚àÄÔæü‚Å†)‚Å†‚òû"
ostrichual,whatever this game is it looks horrible
bread9411,What the fuck... That's insane.
one_frisk,That's a lot of buttons for a game that plays itself
roambeans,"lol, i had friends talk me into playing wow when classic came back out. Our guild got really competitive and I had to install a bunch of addons to play at the level my guild wanted. Shortly after that I quit because I wanted to play a game - not manage spreadsheets."
idlehanz88,Looks like a horrid game to boot
FreshBakedButtcheeks,Why are you playing it
,That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt touch MMO‚Äôs. Not even with a 30 foot pole.
Insighteternal,*Laughs in World of Warcraft display
The_Unusual_Squid,If Elden Ring was made by Ubisoft
doodicalisaacs,It‚Äôs hilarious cause wow people are totally ok with this but worse
Darkurn,what game is this?
Puzzleheaded_Brain64,Average Ubisoft game
mikeistherealgoat,whats even going on
poundofcake,Gamers in Asia prefer this. They want everything visible on the screen over what we want in the west. Clean UI. I‚Äôm sure there are options to hide most of that shit. Request it if not.
ZekDrago,Maybe play on *not* your cell phone?
Werneq,https://i.imgur.com/i0HiVR0.jpg
FrizzleStank,Bahahaha. You should see my WoW UI. It‚Äôs like a fucking cockpit control panel. It‚Äôs bonkers.
BudgetClimate8834,Hypixel Skyblock players: :nervouslook:
Nofapstronaut6,"not illegal, just unbuyable."
PigeonMother,I legitimately thought that was a desktop at first
gabrrdt,"When I see any game like this, I completely lose any will to play them."
Irrationate,At least half of those are a shortcut to micro transactions.
Puzzleheaded-Face-41,Imagine playing this game on a small screen
BennieOkill360,Maybe stop playing shit games
C-Hyena,There's some game in my UI.
Rayhold,Mobile game and people complaining in r/gaming
jonms83,"[We estimate we can sell up to 80% of an individual's field before inducing seizures

Shadow_Freeman,Then you have escape from Tarkov where you have no idea what ammo you have or who's your teammate or if you are currently dying.
CrescentPotato,Ever played a mmorpg buddy?
Jonas_Sp,No one show em a topical WoW raiders ui
Lucas1006,Just play genshin impact
chaotichistory,Honestly ff14 isn't much neater
lockisbetta,Looks like your standard Chinese mmo.
damios1402,This man has never played an mmo before
PlagueDoc22,"I really find that a bad UI will ruin a game for me.

Games nowadays tend to hand feed you everything and guide you towards anything and everything. There's rare you'll naturally explore in games anymore, maybe it's to hide a plain world that isn't very good without you being guided along the ""content path"" but I wish more games would refrain from showing a bunch of stuff on the map for example. Let me explore on my own and reward my exploration."
Baraal,"Don‚Äôt play mobile games then, for starters."
iamthejef,"It's a mobile game. I'd argue less than 1% of games released specifically *for mobile* are worth playing, and until you figure that out you'll see a lot more garbage like this.

The best games on mobile? They're all ports of previous console/pc releases."
Chris_Hylia,Thats why I deleted monster hunter. It was more spreadsheet than rpg.
bersuhan,least complicated ubisoft UI
Difficult-Concept-43,"Simple solution, dont play it"
PlagueDoc22,"The point is not that it's a mobile game port.

It's the fact that you can port a game to steam while doing nothing to clean up the UI for PC.

Game name : Summoners war chronicles"
zvado1,looks like runescape for weebs
MrFluffyhead80,Or you could just play a different game?
WatcherYdnew,Final Fantasy XIV has entered the chat
Cosmicking04,*insert every Roblox game ever*
RegaMasta12,i actually dont mind it
peanutbutternjams,UI/UX Designer here. UI's like this are lazy and don't consider the user at all. I don't know how any self-respecting design team puts out a product like this.
FallenShadeslayer,"And this is why I don‚Äôt play MMOs. I will NEVER understand why they do that. I tried to play Black Desert Online for a Microsoft rewards quest and holy shit I couldn‚Äôt even make it 10 minutes. They spend all that time making the huge world and then I can‚Äôt see fucking any of it because 70% of the screen is the UI. 


Game developers, it‚Äôs unnecessary. There‚Äôs no fucking reason for it and stop."
cannikins,Mobile gamer moment
Shoolooter,Is that genshin?
Faddy0wl,But how else will you spend stupid amounts of money if you can't see every option available to you that takes you to microtransactions??
iJimmyD,Bros really said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs roblox it‚Äù
lamehe999,Looks like that ready player one scene where they want to have like 94% ads on screen
Unused_306_unknow,Game?
Adept-Percentage2331,I played cod mobile with controller. made every icon small and at corners and less opacity
KoolioNoFoolio,"is's a mobile game, we dont have special keybinds or anything"
Noa15Lv,"Technically, if you play mobile games with controller, this much stuff on screen shouldn't exist  in first place... 

My fat fingers would press everything.."
Zeptari,"One less thing I‚Äôll have to worry about, I‚Äôll never play a game that looks like this ever."
Real_Ron1n,I feel like I'm gonna have a seizure just looking at it.
Shack691,It's a mobile game port where they forgot to remove the buttons for basic actions
WutWhoSaidDat,That gives me a headache just looking at it.
Nickmorgan19457,This is a hallmark of MMORPGs
dubshooter,Playing a mobile app on a pc emulator will do that to ya
Led_Halen,"Bleach Brave Souls taught me I shouldn't play gacha games.

I mean, my problem gambling should have taught me that before, but whatever, dad."
045675327,reminds me of wow raids in 2006.
Tokes_ACK,"It's a PC port of a mobile game. I doubt you would experience this level of clutter anywhere else.

I have never seen keybindings displayed on screen like that outside of mobile games."
Mottis86,My solution is not to play games with UI's this cluttered. Seems to be working pretty well so far.
Rammus2201,Bad UXUI design

khrizp,This is fine. ü´†
_bosscrystal,Repulsive UI
needhelp11235,"Looks like they took hints from Ready Player One

We can cover 80% of their vision with ads before they have seizures!"
Ormusn2o,"I'm always a dog for those games where you can mine stuff and smelt stuff, and get gems and craft stuff, and i feel like a lot of those gacha games have one of the best progressions with them, but they always fuck up the balancing around speedups with paid currency. I'm always unwilling to pay for ingame currency so watching those always makes me feel like a salivating dog seeing a snack though a window unable to eat it."
downonthesecond,I played Black Desert for a few minutes and this reminds me of it.
Miryafa,Just your everyday mobile game
Jumpman-x,One of the few times I'm happy OP left the game out of the title. Fuck whatever this is.

ADHDavidThoreau,"If that‚Äôs a combat area, then the HUD should be displaying about 10% of that. If that‚Äôs like a menu/lobby/neutral area, then 50% of that should still be gone."
Lunafreya_NoxF,"Shitty mobile game, shitty UI."
LightKnightTian,"I assume it's a mobile game ported to PC, no surprise it's totally cluttered with icons"
Bread_Responsible,First time I played an mmo I didn‚Äôt have any idea about UI placement. I thought it was just the way it was. I sent someone in a guild I was playing with a picture of my screen once for something I can‚Äôt remember and he bugged the fuck out on me and walked me through step my step organizing it lol. Was much better after.
TheKinkyGuy,Every mobile mmo in existence
Kahzgul,I'm getting flashbacks to vanilla WoW. I had so many damn mods on that it felt more like playing the mods than the actual game.
mrp1ttens,That is ridiculous

Vesalii,That's not bad at all. Have you ever played WoW with add-ons? My guess is no.
Ghostronic,"As someone who did progression raiding in WoW as a priest, this is literally nothing"
Bald-Eagle39,Obviously never played WoW during a raid with full addons‚Ä¶.

UnityAeDeSt,"A reason as to why I uninstalled Black Desert. Their entire UI was all notifications, icons of skills, stats, relationships, map, chat, rewards, mission rewards, quests, missions, interactions‚Ä¶ ughhhh‚Ä¶

On top of that, a big pop up going ‚ÄùOMG, this armour is on sale! We won‚Äôt disappear until you click us!!‚Äù"

Tskear,This is why we vote no to the EoC.
Ebolatastic,It's one of the traits of anime games.  Fighting games and JRPGs are probably the worst offenders.
BronzeHeart92,"Yeah, stuff like this should honestly be illegal in the gaming sphere as a whole. Now on the opposite side of the fence, which game(s) you think shows too little in terms of UI?"
