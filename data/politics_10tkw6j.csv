Eric_in_America,"*The athletic association‚Äôs current Preparticipation Physical Evaluation Form, which must be completed by a student and their physician and kept on file at their school, asks female athletes five questions about their periods, but they‚Äôre all listed as optional.*

*The proposed revisions to the form include four mandatory questions about menstruation, including if the student has ever had a period, the age they had their first period, the date of their most recent period and how many periods they‚Äôve had in the past year.*

Yeesh, this is coming from the party that's spent the last couple of years crying about their medical freedom. 

Make no mistake, Republicans are more then a eager to abandon their so called ""values"" if it's for the sake of their culture war. Desantis has shown us time and time again that he's willing to justify flagrant government overreach, censorship, suppression, discriminatory and ambiguously framed legislation, among other things of course, as long it preserves the culture war. 

It's the Republican M.O after all. Manufacture a problem to justify its solution. In this case, Desantis and his fellow scaremongers paint a picture of a transgender boogeyman, they overstate the impact of things like the transgender athletes in women's sports, they convince their voters that these issues are inescapable and ubiquitous, they peddle their propaganda and their alarmist rhetoric, and in turn it grants them all the support and justification they need to target the LGBTQ community through measures like these.

As long as it's in the name of thwarting the radical left's depraved, woke, subversive plot to establish a new world order, anything goes. Keep in mind that this isn't just about pursuing a regressive agenda or about justifying needlessly heavy-handed legislation, it's also about justifying the underlying attitudes that Republicans feel they've been forced to repress. 

The chauvinism and bigotry, the enmity and antagonism, the disgust and contempt, the ceaseless outrage, the discrimination and the feelings of entitlement, with the existence of this radical left-wing villain comes the power for Republicans to vindicate themselves, it allows them to indulge their own worst impulses and it helps them rationalize these subdued feelings."

allegedalpaca,"Directly from the article:

CLAIM: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is requiring all female student-athletes in the state to provide detailed information about their periods in order to compete in organized sports.  
  
AP‚ÄôS ASSESSMENT: False. The Florida High School Athletic Association is weighing the recommendation from an advisory committee, but no final decision has been made. DeSantis‚Äô education commissioner is a member of the association‚Äôs board of directors and the commissioner also appoints three others, but the association is a private nonprofit organization, not a state agency under the purview of the governor‚Äôs office.

Chrisbap,"So creepy and awful for these teen girls.  

Also, what‚Äôs to stop them from lying and/or giving false information to F with the system?  Or maybe that‚Äôs when Phase 2 (the inspections) kicks in.  ü§Æ"
NeedMoreGreenBacks,"**The article was issued by AP to correct online misinformation per the below footnote.**





*This is part of AP‚Äôs effort to address widely shared misinformation...to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.*





The opening paragraphs are as follows:





**CLAIM**: *Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is requiring all female student-athletes in the state to provide detailed information about their periods in order to compete in organized sports.*





AP‚ÄôS ASSESSMENT: **FALSE.** *The* **Florida High School Athletic Association** *is weighing the recommendation from an advisory committee, but no final decision has been made. DeSantis‚Äô education commissioner is a member of the association‚Äôs board of directors and the commissioner also appoints three others, but the association is a private nonprofit organization,* **not a state agency under the purview of the governor‚Äôs office.**



The article then goes on to say:



*Robert Sefcik, a member of the sports medicine advisory committee, said making the menstrual cycle questions mandatory rather than optional is consistent with* **national guidelines for sports physicals** *developed by the* **American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Sports Medicine and other groups**.





*He said having a form that has been vetted and published by national organizations provides an ‚Äúextremely credible resource‚Äù for doctors conducting sports physicals.*





*‚ÄúWe appreciate the medical necessity of the questions, including menstrual history, that are included on this form and support their inclusion on the form,‚Äù Sefcik, who was the committee‚Äôs previous chairperson and voted in favor of recommendations, wrote in an email The national guidelines say menstrual history is an ‚Äúessential discussion for female athletes‚Äù because period abnormalities could be a sign of ‚Äúlow energy availability, pregnancy, or other gynecologic or medical conditions.‚Äù*





**‚ÄúMenstrual dysfunction is 2-3 times more common in athletes than nonathletes, and 10-15% of female athletes have amenorrhea (loss of menstrual cycle) or oligomenorrhea (a decrease in number of menstrual cycles per year),‚Äù the guidelines read. ‚ÄúAmenorrhea occurs more frequently in players of sports that emphasize leanness, such as running, gymnastics, cheerleading, dance, and figure skating.‚Äù**


Edit:


Per **Outsports** (an LGBT sports website):


*""At least 44 states currently require or request the asking of female high school athletes for information about their ‚Äúmenstrual period,‚Äù Outsports has found through a state-by-state examination of publicly available ‚Äúpreparticipation physical evaluation‚Äù forms, as they are commonly called.""*


*Many of the states asked similar or identical questions to one another, as their forms are derived from ‚Äî or copies of ‚Äî the pre-participation evaluation form suggested and written by the **American Academy of Pediatrics**.*


*‚ÄúThe AAP has included these questions because medical providers who perform sports physicals recognize that they are important,‚Äù said Dr. Rebecca Carl from the Institute for Sports Medicine and an AAP representative. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also important to note that we take the concerns about privacy seriously. The information is not designed to be shared with schools. That information is to document the information between the person performing the physical and the student-athlete and their family.‚Äù*


*Of the 44 states that include these questions, there was no significant difference between how often Republican-led or Democratic-led states utilized them on their suggested or required forms.*"

fdc7719,"Since the Nixon administration, conservatives have pushed all of these non-social issues in front of us to draw attention away from how badly they are fucking their own constituents. A lot of it was insincere rhetoric to get the Evangelical vote every 4 years. Except now we have true believers in the rhetoric. Every day they have to keep upping the outrage to drive conservatives that buy the narrative to the polls. If they did anything less, they are deemed a RINO and abandoned by the party. Honestly, after Obama was elected the first time, in my own lifetime, I saw the true face of conservatives. All of this morality bullshit that they claim to hold so dear clearly isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs actually important to them. It‚Äôs a convenient excuse to push horrific agendas that harm various minority groups. I thought I had seen the extent of how badly they would throw a tantrum during Obama‚Äôs second term. I‚Äôm now horrified every single day that they somehow manage to keep lowering the bar.
