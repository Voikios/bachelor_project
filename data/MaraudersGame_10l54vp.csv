Pizza_Bi1l,Man bummer…..now people have to learn to aim again
javelinwounds,Make the only two good shotguns garbage so none of them are good pog
ncghost213,Well the Terminator was massacring servers so it seems fair
Conmanjames,ya’ll acting like they made it unusable. it’s just not OP AF anymore.
scared_star,Rip i liked that shotgun even before it was broken
appa_the_magic_bum,Maybe do something about the bugs first
blendedbullshit,It was perfectly balanced :(
moorekeny1001,"Shotguns are hard to balance in any game, I think they made a decent choice in balancing it, but they may have went too far. I felt it was slightly overpowered, I think a longer reload and slower ads and a slight damage drop off would have been Sufficient. But they sure did nerf it to the ground, I guess back to ppsh supremacy I go."
Plastic-Ad-503,This has been my biggest hope for the game for weeks
laughingskull00,"good, damn thing is trash, honestly should be in the rust bucket along with the luger. I hate its irl counter part just from seeing it misfire repeatedly"
Uselesswizardmini,Deserved
Sors_Numine,Damn. They straight killed the terminator
YaBoyEvit,Is this jsut a planned change for the future or is there an update? Can someone link me to it if so
appa_the_magic_bum,As a terminator user never really got killed by it mostly when I missed and couldn’t relocate fast enough. Idk it wasn’t that bad prolly just skill issue cuz I do just as good if not better with stg
Amaninthetrees,"Honestly, still can pick heads with it, just isn't the lvl 12 death stick that it was."
Paydie,"Damn how about the sawed off though? In all my games dying to ai i’ve died ever time to sawed off. One pickaxe, and one lmg."
Dranzer009,When you have fun and the solution is to nerf. I wonder what's next
NouSkion,"Not enough of a nerf in my opinion, but I'll take what I can get."
Bottledisc,Did they nerf the L1A1 and STG yet?
McNovaZero,"Good, I hate shotguns in every fps and OP shotguns I hate with a passion. Sorry shotgun sluts looks like you're gonna have to start aiming and clicking more than once."
SilentDragaur,Good.
