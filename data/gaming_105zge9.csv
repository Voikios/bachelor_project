jif_hall,That PS5 hanging off the unit isn't matching my aesthetic
kozzmo1,A couch doesn‚Äôt match the game rooms aesthetic or do you just need glasses
amnhanley,"I‚Äôve been married 17 years.  

When we first got married my wife was jealous of the time I spent playing video games.  So we talked about it.  She had some misconceptions about why I was spending time that way and I didn‚Äôt understand that she wanted my attention.  So we talked about it we learned more about each other and how to be a good partner to each other.  17 years later and we both have separate hobbies and spaces in our home where we can enjoy those hobbies.  That‚Äôs how it should work in a healthy relationship.

If doesn‚Äôt sound like that‚Äôs your situation.  You uh.  You should do something about that.  Talk about it."
Setore,"This is why you agree on a library, add board games and then you finish off with video games and movies so it's a multimedia room. Video games are a media."
astonaidan,Why you so close to the TV dawg
EasternShade,"Ah, the classic glorification of marital conflict."
thegiantgummybear,I don‚Äôt understand why you don‚Äôt just sit on a couch or something?
IAMIACEE,Unless your goal was to get roasted I don't think this is going to turn out like you hoped.
johndepp22,does she set time limits for you too big guy?
ComprehensionVoided,"I went other route.. 

Wife left, so no longer clashes."
Randy_Muffbuster,But she‚Äôs ok with that pizza box of a console hanging out and those unsightly cables and peripherals hanging everywhere? Smh
Rikki_Sixx,"Do you not have a sofa or armchair in that room? 

The only reason to use a folding chair is for full immersion while playing a wrestling game."
SjurEido,"How so many people have so little power in their own relationships that they can't even have a spot in their OWN HOME to enjoy a hobby.  


My god, how sad."
Weaseltime_420,"I feel like OP is learning that his situation is not normal and that other married people don't actually live like this.

Hopefully they are able to reflect on this new information and have a calm rational discussion with their wife."
wiinintendontcare,Shoutout to all of the people here who don't let their partner dictate dumb shit lol
GraySparrow,Do other people not sit on their couch and game? Does an uncomfortable chair a foot away from the TV whilst disparaging my spouse improve the experience that much? This is weird.
Cascascap,"Enjoy Outer Wilds, OP.
It's an experience you can only go through once, fantastic game."
X0AN,She your wife or your mum? üòÇ
RedsealONeal,That doesn't look like the best console placement hahaha
zzzzany,That room‚Äôs aesthetics are pretty sad.
TheRealDevDev,"Welp, this was the post that finally made me unsub here. I‚Äôm officially too old to read dumb bait posts like this."
OnlyFandoms,Yo Outer Wilds is GOAT tho.
Makenshine,"This seems fake since a TV without furniture seems like a ridiculous interior  design decision.

Also, this relationship dynamic would be an unhealthy part of a the marriage. It's a shared living space. All parties get a say to what they need to be comfortable in it. Neither party should be ""banning"" shit.

For example. I dont need much. Just one little corner of the house to put my computer desk and gaming setup. Some place I can have me time. That's all I need. My wife loves setting up the house though. As of now, we have the room for me to set up my space in a back room, but when we lived in a smaller place, my eye sore of a desk was in a common room. We compromised to both be happy."
Amro_dir,"Hate to say it dude, but grow a backbone and stick up for yourself. Hobbies are important and so is comfort when going about them. Go and buy yourself at least a decent chair to sit on because that thing you're using there will kill your back, neck, knees...  
If she doesn't like the ""aesthetic""... tough."
HoodaThunkett,more ‚Äúmy wife‚Äù bullshit
thebugman10,Why do you have to sit so close?
CrabWoodsman,"I have a work friend whose wife constantly rotates the speakers so that they're square with the room, despite him explaining how that's going to make it sound terrible.

Very glad that my partner actually hears me when I talk about that stuff and doesn't keep sacrificing function for form."
Epicporkchop79-7,"Well, beyond all of the questions of your wife's character. I will note 2 things. First is that the chair is unsustainable, over time it will both hurt your back and dig a hole in the floor. Secondly might be finding a better way to put the console so it can breath. Chair in front of a big screen TV is hardly like punishment, just get a better chair and a mat to go under it."
chickenstalker,"I'm a husband and a dad. If your wife controls you to such a degree, you have a relationship problem. Marriage is about cooperating and compromises. I let my wife indulge in her hobbies and she lets me indulge in mine. There must be a space where you can take off your dad/husband/mum/wife hat and relax. Enough is enough. Take what is your right in the relationship."
xxELBUNDOxx,F
mr-mercury,That looks like hemorrhoids inducing chair. Good luck Dad. I won the battle thanks for hemorrhoids!
DeezSaltyNuts69,"1. Go get an eye exam, you shouldn't be sitting that close to any TV
2. toss that chair, you're going to give yourself back problems
3. go schedule time for couples counseling because this is bullshit
4. this room looks like a bland model home, you wife has no aesthetic besides being tasteless"
its_merv_not_marv,"Get a SteamDeck and play anywhere, even the toilet to be out of sight out of mind"
fivefeetofawkward,"Just have a wife that builds you a gaming room with a tv and setup specifically designed for gaming. Bonus points if she joins you. 


But seriously it‚Äôs your house too, my husband and I have set it up where we both feel happy with our home. We focused on making the place work for *us* first and guests as a second thought. Who cares if the couch is at a weird angle 90%of the time, we just put sliders under the feet so if we have guests we can rearrange to make it work."
NewcDukem,Sounds like a healthy relationship..
schoppi_m,"Why do you want to sit so close to the TV, OP?"
Ghazter,Suppose this is what it is like to live in your wife‚Äôs home.
katsalion,"What is your wifes aesthetic exactly ? Beige walls and letters as decoration ? Not trying to be an asshole but Come on, stick up for yourself. Your wife is not your parent, you should be able to fit your hobbies into your home and have a say in how your home is decorated."
Greenranger70,This is fucking sad and pathetic lmfao
IHateThisDamnWebsite,Man y‚Äôall have some shit ass partners.
Auraaurorora,Shout out to all the men trying to pawn off their lack of freedom on their bad relationship decisions. (Discuss this shit before you get married)
boskee,Sounds like a miserable marriage to be honest. Partners usually come to an \*agreement\* that suits everyone.
swr3212,Grow a pair.
anotheralpaca69,Sitting 4 feet from the TV is a you problem. Route those wires behind the wall and get a bigger media center for that ps5 and I'm sure the wife will be fine.
Neuromantul,Grow some balls
Hetakuoni,You shouldn‚Äôt sit so close to the screen. It‚Äôs bad for your eyes. Sit on the couch that‚Äôs most likely cropped out and get a wireless controller dweeb.
The_Passive_Fist,"I keep telling the missus we need 2 TVs in the lounge. She keeps telling me it will ""look terrible""

I reckon it'll look awesome, and it will mean I can play and she can watch a show at the same time without us being at opposite ends of the house.

I cant be the only one who wants/has this setup?"
umjeffunfiltered,Boohoo Should have keep their Joystick in the pants when not gaming
MrCensoredFace,Unhealthy couple moment. Kinda depressing that shitty relationships like this are the norm.
PaulyNewman,Everyone in this comment section acting like op is the boy under the stairs because he doesn‚Äôt have a fucking rbg setup with a massive lazy boy in the center of the room.
BeginningGas3569,Create a spaceship aesthetic game room!
Sirvink,I just traded up to a game friendly wife.
Captain_CatDad,Please consider moving that console - not enough room for the heat to go there.
Avolation742,Shout out to all the men who live under the thumb so bad they cant even influence the layout of their own loungeroom. Shame.
rurounijosie,"Judging by the giant letter, the aesthetic is prob ""white Christian woman""."
Robenever,Bruh. This is seriously cringy. ‚ÄúWife‚Äôs aesthetic‚Äù is just a cover up for controlling and vein.
WodanzaRuckus,Your fault for marrying someone like that. Fuck that.
,Shout out to all the neutered men?
pauciradiatus,Something something you'll go blind
Black_n_Neon,You sit that close to the TV?
TexasBuddhist,Do the 84 bottles of lotion and hair products and perfume littering the bathroom counter match her aesthetic?
NHartline,Goddamn this comment section got blown way out of proportion by a bunch of marriage experts. People really suggesting this guy see a marriage counselor cause he plays video games close to the TV instead of sitting way back on his couch
dimbulb771,It's your house also...
hovercroft,Must suck to have a shitty wife
EnvironmentalPie9651,"Yeah, no. I work too hard to provide and not get my own space. Your wife is not entitled to the entire house just because she wants to match things up.

This is why boundaries are critical. She‚Äôs not entitled to every room because she‚Äôs a woman that likes to decorate. Good luck man"
CazT91,"But your room looks perfect for a small classic armchair. Or perhaps even better a wing/fan back. These chairs are comfy and small enough to move easily. Some even come on casters.

Just don't tell the wife the real reason you want it. Just tell her the room doesn't feel complete and you think an accent chair would be perfect. She may be pleasantly supprised you thought of it. Just let her pick the exact style to match and just reassure her it's an excuse to buy more cushions too üòâü§≠"
EnochianBlade923,Bro scoot that fucking chair back
ivegoticecream,Yes offense but your wife‚Äôs decor tastes are pitiful.
HarunoSakuraCR,Why doesn‚Äôt her junk mess with YOUR aesthetic?
mike19871969,Those men chose poorly.
ShawshankException,Everything about this is depressing as fuck my guy.
Sultan_of_Swing92,"Fuck this, you gotta stand up for your own happiness at some point"
Delica,"I‚Äôd like to see how long your leash is, and whether it matches the aesthetic."
JohnnyAK907,Two words: Cord Management. I feel no sympathy for the owner of this setup.
nthpwr,they should grow a pair
