{"Title": "New player experience", "Post Text": "Hello, I am a completely new player, I've probably done 4 or 5 PMC raids and a few scav runs.\n\nAs a PMC i get clapped all the time and survived only once because i was an absolute pussy and went straight to the extract after killing 1 scav and boy was that a rush.\n\nI really really like the game, the posts about all the problems with it does cause some concern but for now i have not experienced much of the bad.\n\nMy last raid i tried doing a mission of finding a note in woods and after finding it i got into a fight with another PMC where i dumped a full 17 round magazine of pistol bullets into him, missing most and then stabbing the fucker, killing him and dying of bleeding after a few seconds. It was the most exciting and fun moment i have experienced in an online game.\n\nI just wanted to share a bit of positivity on here as most posts are negative, also if you have any tips for beginners that'd be nice.\n\nCheers!", "ID": "1085mvx", "Score": 981, "Total Comments": 297, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1085mvx/new_player_experience/"}
