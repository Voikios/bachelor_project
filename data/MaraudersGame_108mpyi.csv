I totally want to unlock it but I don't play that much atm."
TheChefClaw,Good shit!
ShamrockJesus,"My buddy and I were leaving last night and saw blown up ship and a rust bucket and were like ""let's go try and steal that interceptor from him"" and when we got closer we realized it was a damn red Baron. Boarded it and found the poor guys corpse and we got to kill the Baron for the first time. Shame it doesn't count for both of us though since we were a team. And unfortunately we didnt have enough time to use the token"
