Hiei2k7,"Maybe if paying the workers is job destroying, maybe it's a job that shouldn't exist in the first place."
logicalnoise,"So here's the thing that all this talk keeps quiet. The company is the least important part of this. If the business can't keep going while it's employees are gainfully employed then it's a failure and should close. Instead the media, government and companies all seem to agree that the employees should bear the brunt of keeping a bad business plan working."

cheap90scigar,"> In the letter, Erlanger noted that the company wasn't against increasing the minimum wage. ""Let me be clear: we support legislation that leads to meaningful improvements in our communities, including responsible increases to the minimum wage. Our business does well when our employees and our communities do well,"" he said.


It‚Äôs incredibly expensive to my community for people to be paid under a living wage. The FAST Act passed because the fast food chains in our communities failed to increase wages and improve working conditions on their own."
fencerman,"In 1975, the average grocery store clerk was earning the equivalent of $29 an hour, or about $58,000 a year.

(Edit to fix the link: https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/bls/bls_1925_1976.pdf)

From the article: 

>""Full-time grocery clerks, numerically the largest occupation, averaged $5.33 [an hour]""

$5.33 an hour in 1975 is the equivalent of $29 an hour in 2022.

homelaberator,"The prime market for McDonald's is people on lower incomes. If you give those people more disposable cash, they will buy (amongst other things) more McDonald's.

The whole broad sweep of that is true for minimum wage in general. Putting more money into the pockets of ordinary people grows the economy bigly. They are the ones spending the money, creating the jobs that give others money to spend.

The ultimate end of shifting wealth up, into the hands of fewer and fewer, is feudalism. A handful of wealthy and powerful people that control everyone else with most the population too poor even for anything but subsistence farming. It's the death of civilisation."

fardough,"I have some sympathy for franchise owners because corporate controls price increases, so they don‚Äôt get a say in passing along the cost.

However, this claim is bullshit.  We are talking about a 30 cent increase per item to raise the wage to $22.  We saw double this level of increase this past year, and barely any of that went to higher wages.

I call for a new company tax.  If your employees pull government subsidies, the company gets billed the cost of them.  We can no longer let companies pass off the cost of living to private citizens, and allow them a subsidy for employee wages.  Pay employees wage or pay for the social safety net.

Edit: I now have much less sympathy for the franchisees after being informed they do get to set their own prices."

paininmylefteye,"I think we also need to start giving people the yearly equivalent when discussing this issue. $22/hr may sound like a lot to an older, salaried individual who worked for $5.25/hr in high school, so also describing it as $44,000/year ($22/hr working 40hrs/wk for 50 weeks) might people make the connection that it is still not a huge salary in today‚Äôs economy.

Include the fact that there often zero benefits like healthcare/dental, PTO, or disability insurance, it‚Äôs just not much to live on, especially in a bigger city. Also, home ownership?  Phhht. Good luck saving up a down payment while paying rent and coving other bills."

RickTracee,"Yeah because putting more money in the hands of people who will readily spend it helps the economy.

Increased wages and spending raise demand and create more jobs.

Workers stay with employers longer (instead of seeking out better-paying work with other companies) reducing businesses‚Äô turnover, hiring, and training costs.

Lower unemployment and higher wages increase tax revenues.

When workers earn higher wages, they rely less on governmental ‚Äúsafety net‚Äù programs.

So yeah, it would be 'costly and job destroying.' SMH"
Character-Education3,McMurrays a piece of shit
ndngroomer,"I own what I consider a fairly successful small business in the pet services industry (grooming, pet hotel, daycare, dog/cat training, vet clinic, etc) currently with three locations and am in the process of opening up my fourth location this summer. My wife is a doctor who also owns a fairly successful medical clinic and she also has four locations in our community. Against everyone's advice and to great criticism among our family friends and peers in our professions we felt that we were going to pay a fair and livable wage. The starting pay for anyone who starts to work for either of us is $22/hr with the exception of my dog groomers. They get their own ridiculously generous pay commission structure.  In fact, I take great pride for the fact that several of my groomers have made over six figures the last couple of years when they were lucky to make $35/yr working their asses off before working for me as pet groomers. 

We still do very well financially and our businesses are still very profitable and growing faster than we know what to do with even though we pay these wages. Our employees are amazing. They work so hard, are so innovative and extremely dedicated and loyal. This year I decided to give all of my staff a 10% raise because of inflation. I also decided to do a very generous bonus payout to my staff. I was called a fool by my many, including family members and friends for this but it's my money so I figured that I can do what I want. This year for bonuses I took 30% of the total profits and divided them evenly among my employees. I have a little over 60 employees so that came out to a little over $6k per person. The looks on their face and the letters of appreciation I got were worth it alone. My thinking for doing this was that this was the third year in a row for record breaking profits because of everyone's hard work. This absolutely wouldn't have happened without their hard work and dedication so I felt that it was wrong not to share this profit with them. 

So I say all of this to say that if my wife and I can afford to pay $22/hr as the starting pay to our employees in our professions then I truly believe other businesses can too. I guess what makes us different is that we just are not greedy and arrogant people who have big egos that has to be constantly praised. I grew up in extreme poverty. I'm saying I'm a native American who grew up on a tribal trust land kind of extreme poverty. Now that I have the resources to help others in my community I feel it is what I must do. My wife on the other hand grew up in extreme wealth but she's also one of the kindest and most generous and unselfish person I know. 

The thing I honestly don't understand is that even tho my wife and I have consistently and continue to prove all of our critics wrong we still get called all kinds of horrible things and criticized for how we pay our employees. Especially by our competition and colleagues in each of our respective professions. If only more businesses would only open their eyes and see the big picture, maybe look at it like an investment even, that by treating your employees with respect and paying them a fair and liveable wage the return on that investment far outweighs what so many companies are currently doing now instead chosing to work their employees hard, treating them like shit and pay them poverty and slave wages. I just don't understand why they are so blind to this. Especially the ones criticizing me and my wife so harshly even tho they can obviously see our success that is proving them wrong in real time. I honestly just don't understand this. 

Anyway, I just thought I'd share my anecdotal experience with everyone. Thanks for reading."
americanspirit64,"What McDonald's is railing against is a business model based on corporate greed and the exploitation of workers in order to make huge profits.  One of the ways they do this is down-playing how difficult the job can be.  This isn't about just flipping burgers it is about working at a business that treats workers badly, as if they don't matter and paids them shit.  If covid taught us anything, is that essential workers are essential, not a throw away job population.  It is the same song and dance they want us to believe about trash collectors they are essential.   This is all about people doing a competent job under bad working conditions for a living wage, nothing more.  Whether they call it pick up trash or flipping burgers.  School teachers are one of the most highly abused workers for low pay.   They don't want good workers, what they want is an endless supply of low wage workers they can employ for pennies.  The $7.25 dollar an hour federal minimum in this country, won't buy a worker or their family two loaves of bread for an hours work.  What it will buy them is maybe a dozen loaves of bread a day. Changing that is simple, lower the cost of bread.  Please this is slave labor at its finest.  It is also why we are facing a Health-Care crises in this country, no one can afford it.  If McDonalds had to pay their workers health-care you can bet insurance would be lower.  America would also make a higher tax base.  This is the America, our Capitalism environment wants, to make Capitalism only benefit the rich.

Our true economic problems started, when we decided we could use food as fuel for our cars from corn.  It raised the price of every grain on the planet.  There are other plants that have a greater bio-mass and can product more ethanol per acre than corn.  Those plants just don't have the American Corn Association lobbying for the use of corn as fuel.  It should be illegal to use food in such a way."
Theelfsmother,"I bet he claims that he started making fries and worked really hard to get where he is today. He got there on nothing but hard work and a good attitude.

lollipop_nuts,"He is a Hypocrite in Chief .  McDonald's is the company which moves money around the world to avoid paying taxes.  McDonald's pays their hourly staff non-living wages. Staff must seek government welfare to survive. Welfare is underfunded because some wealthy companies and folks do not pay their fair share of taxes. So goes the downward spiral and destruction of an economy.

Tim_Allosaurus,"Depending on the area this is a 100% true. 22 hour for McDonald‚Äôs in LA, New York, Miami, ect.

ferret1983,"It can be done no problem. But the hamburgers would be more expensive - similar to Nordic prices.

Main difference in labour market Sweden/Nordics vs USA is that -ALL- jobs here pay a decent living wage.

It's because the Unions here have so much power and negotiate salaries and benefits with the employer. We have no minimum wage. 

So, our hamburgers are more expensive. Taxi, barber, cleaning services are more expensive. 

In return noone needs to have two jobs to survive and there are fewer problems in society."
BitterPuddin,"Dunno about the rest of you, but I think that approach is self defeating.  Fast food isn't fast.  It isn't cheap.  Usually the order isn't right. The employees often have attitudes because they have shit pay, and after covid knows that life doesn't have to be awful.

I have a business that has me often going on service calls, and I used to get fast food breakfast pretty much every day, and often lunch.

Now, I just scarf oatmeal for breakfast, and wait til I get home to eat.  I have lost weight, and I bet I have saved thousands since covid hit.

I went on Google Maps and literally counted McDonalds within a 20 minute drive. Australia was 2, America was 20.

That's even not accounting for the fact the other chains dwarf Australia 10 to 1 as well.

The spread of of these restaurants allowed due to low wages has done harm, unfortunately Mr. McDonalds, yes you overextended and rising wages will probably mean stores need to close.

Government needs to ensure social safety nets are in place and education opportunities are open to transition this as they increase minimum wages."

Badwins,"Notice he says job killing, not business killing.

The days of relying on labor are ending. Vast majority of McDonald‚Äôs supply chain can be done without humans working traditional jobs.

At $15/hour there is less incentive to invest in robots. At $23/hr, there is more pressure to invest in robots.

Do you want a team of 5 on shift at McDonald‚Äôs each earning $15/hour?

Or, do you want a team of 2 earning $22/hr where are expected to do more work with their robot coworkers?

That is the *only* possible outcome."

The guy working the counter at your local McDonald's is more than likely getting paid by the franchisee, who is not making $7 million a year.  The franchisee's are the ones who are going to get slammed with the large raise in minimum wages.

Which in the end will result in either employees getting fewer hours (Maybe 24 instead of 30, or the FT minimum of 32 instead of 40), or not replacing employees that leave and just working short handed to keep payroll costs steadier."

JeromesNiece,"Two things are true at once:

1. CEO pay growth has grossly outpaced pay growth for the average worker, and the current ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay is obscene.

2. This guy is absolutely correct; a $22 minimum wage for fast food workers in California would be costly and job destroying, and this would be true even if the President of McDonalds worked for free.

Many redditors seem totally unable to conceptualize the difference in magnitude between a 50% wage hike for tens of thousands of workers vs. a CEO salary. The former is on the scale of hundreds of millions of dollars per year. The latter is below ten million dollars per year. You cannot fund a 50% wage increase for tens of thousands of workers by cutting the CEO's salary. The math just doesn't work."
Impossible-Key-2212,"The equation for automation is very simple

Add up the yearly wage, taxes paid by corp, training, vacation, retirement and you have a good number to start.  At 22 an hour an individual would cos the company approximately $52000.00 year.  If the restaurant is open for 16 hours a day the wage is $104000.00.  This is based on a 2000 hour work year.  40 hours a week for 50 weeks.

A kiosk order station costs about $15000.00.
A line cook robot is less than $150000.00 per unit.
The return on investment is often time less than one year.  

No one will have a job at a fast food restaurant except a person to unload the truck and put the food away.

You can work at McDonald's for $22/hr or you can work at George's Family Restaurant for $15.50. It's not the fast food conglomerates' bottom line that is troubled by a nearly 50% wage increase, it's the small business who is competing with them already for labor. 

You have got to take a step back from the ""fuck CEOs and corporations and capitalism"" table and start to think about second order effects of these things. This is going to end up with the ""road to hell is paved with good intentions"" bucket and this comment section is cheering it on."

HobsNCalvin,What about the McDonald‚Äôs in Texas that is automatically made and served by A.I
d_e_l_u_x_e,"Not in some European countries though, just in the richest country can we not afford to pay our workers."
mostlygroovy,"There‚Äôs nothing that destroys my support of our current capitalist structure than executive pay.

Meta‚Äôs value (at one point) tumbled by 75% and Zuckerberg was still making a base salary of $28M"
Originalfrozenbanana,"Assuming the average wage at a McDonalds is $15/hr, just fire the CEO and subsidize 1 million worker hours worth of salary increases. Still job destroying, but this time it's only the CEO whose job gets destroyed. I'm cool with it."
moradinshammer,"They pay these higher wages elsewhere in the world, often with higher taxes and they do it because they can still be profitable doing it"
Jacque_Hass,The paradigm shift is long overdue
bshepp,Every corporation has decided how much of your money they deserve while none of them are willing to give you that kind of money.
Please_do_not_DM_me,"There's too much subsidizing of these industries going on. TBH if we pull back and 50% of the franchises go under that's healthy. The remaining business can become more productive, charge more, and we'll have fewer fat people.

Like where I live, there's 5 restaurants (EDIT: it's actually over 8 I forgot about the DelTaco across  the street and a chinese place down the road.) within walking distance. Under 12 minutes one way to the farthest one. Realistically there should be like 2.

(EDIT: Oh, and there's 2 more being built 100 yards from me. So a total of 9 in the next few years...)"
tacky_pete,Won‚Äôt someone think about the shareholders!!
Outrageous_Fall_9568,Strike!
screenmasher,That's great. I'm all for it. People will work honestly for good pay. Last time I went to McDonald's the 14 year old behind the register was on his cell phone and couldn't be bothered. I don't blame him for 8 bucks an hour
BackwardsColonoscopy,"I guess I really am just that poor, but I can't imagine making MILLIONS in a year and thinking, 'okay i need more than this'. Some perspective, it'd take me 12-15 years to make 1 million if I could save my entire paycheck. This guy makes more money than most people will make in a lifetime and doesn't stop to think for a moment, huh, maybe I finally have enough. 

I'm not entirely convinced rich people are fully human. But I am convinced this system can't continue like this much longer."
MrTBirdGaming,Why is this in politics?
dustwanders,"So? $18 is costly and life destroying to your worker

They only care about themselves"
Cult_Chief,"Imagine making over 3k an hour every workday and being like ""AH yeah, these workers that worked harder than I? They can have this petty change c:""

Seriously. With that sort of money the man basically makes a regular years wage in a single day."
barth_,"Denmark would like a word about this ""job destroying"" thing."
BeastOfTheField83,r/latestagecapitalism
lnin0,"Companies can pay outrageous salaries to their CEOs,  buy back billions in stock and make sure to never cut a shareholder‚Äôs dividend but when it comes to workers, fuck ‚Äòem."
Upper-Application583,They make so much revenue.. they can pay it.so easy :(
BlueMANAHat,"Mcdonalds corp would not pay these wages as they dont hire restaurant employees directly. The brunt of the cost would go to franchise owners.

But with that said its important to note that Finland or Poland I forget which mcD pays the equivalent of 22 an hour and their big mac costs less than ours..."
_Oooooooooooooooooh_,"22 per hour, 40 hours per week would be ~45760 dollars per year

That is 160 workers, they could have paid that, instead of paying him. lol"
Alarmifdfgh,the President of McDonald‚Äôs makes only $7 million a year.
TravelingHero2,Exploitation by Capitalist scumbags at its finest.
giosthebest,Thats how hes able to make 7.4 a year
Jumbalayaq,Keeping it in the top 1%. Lol.
3ye0f8alor,"It is because the higher ups want their bonuses and incredibly high salaries. That‚Äôs what bothers me about all of these bailouts over Covid and the banking crisis. If these companies just saved their excess money for losses, the government wouldn‚Äôt have to bail them out or have massive layoffs. Greed. That‚Äôs our problem. Greed"
EmmaLouLove,Billionaires who call working class Americans lazy and then tell workers to eat cake is getting a little old.
-bferis-,McDonald's should just close up shop in California.
Hellige88,"So if this guy works 40 hours per week, he‚Äôd be making $3,557.69 an hour. That‚Äôs over 160 times the pay rate that he‚Äôs saying is ‚Äútoo much!‚Äù"
BilfordWimley,"Dude. I get paid 20$ to run two industrial air fryers. In a kitchen that's only been open for 7 months and makes a couple thousand a week, instead of millions a month, all around the world. This guy sounds like he needs to wake up with a Ronald McDonald head godfather style"
Rensi,Now that's how you write a headline
routerg0d,"Maybe it‚Äôs time to pass a law where the highest paid employee at a company including the board if compensated, cannot exceed a multiple of 10. Then I bet these CEOs would figure out how to do raises. The savings could pay for 150 more 22 a hour employees just from his pay."
M142Man,Wealthy executives aren't reading the room
tomfrost13,He‚Äôs full of shit evidenced by the healthy wages McDonald‚Äôs pays their workers in some other countries with very minimal price differences for customers
UUtch,"I mean looks like McDonald's has over 11 million employees just in the United States, so considering he could give away his entire yearly salary and each employee would get less than a dollar as a Christmas bonus, I must say I don't see how his salary shows where the money could come from without cutting hours"
3Quondam6extanT9,"""I'm wealthy. We can't pay people more money because that would make me a fraction less wealthy and that is unacceptable."""
fthotmixgerald,"The idea that CEOs earn more because they work harder is one of the most obvious lies in history. I've worked with multiple CEOs and these people don't do shit.

Woker-owned cooperatives are more efficient, more productive and more resilient against closure. Get rid of the standard hierarchy ASAP."
