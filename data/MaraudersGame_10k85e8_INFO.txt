The aesthetic is great and the gameplays funnish but im starting to understand alot of peoples frustration with it and thinking its full of hackers because it is really hard to tell. You can mag dump people and they have time to turn around and 1-2 tap you with some rifle. The terminator consistently 1 drops me in the BODY from across long hallways or on the complete other side of a rustbucket. the moment you take a step a single headshot from some guy with 0.1 second reaction speed folds you. It is really hard to tell if someone is genuine or not with how vastly different guns and damage can be. You run out of gear space fast so sometimes dying and losing shit is something you need to do because finding toolkits for boxes isnt exactly common. Im for damn sure not using a toolkit on a STEN stock lol. It just really sucks the steam out of you when for the fourth raid in a row you get dropped immediately by a terminator shot to the BODY in the red panzer armor from 30-40 meters from a TTVname and even if its genuine, boy it feels sus af.", "ID": "10k85e8", "Score": 35, "Total Comments": 52, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/10k85e8/i_understand_now_why_people_think_the_games_full/"}
