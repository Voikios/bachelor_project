vibrance9460,"Plunder Social Security 

OR TAX THE RICH 

?"
Gruffstuff2021,Life expectancy is not falling for the Republicans in Congress.
Linkage006,As a GenXer I'm so going to enjoy dying at my desk instead of retiring to Del Boca Vista
-metaphased-,"Life expectancy is falling.  Wages aren't keeping up.  Pensions are going away.  Health plans are getting worse.  Productivity is...up, up, up, up.  Society is advancing for rich people at the cost of advancing it for everyone."
NotmyRealNameJohn,"Cool.  If you are a registered republican, you can retire at 70"
ThickerSalmon14,"I will point out that most manual labor jobs simply can't be done by most people in their late sixties.  It takes a toll on their bodies.  Sure rich people who don't work a day in their life might be able to pull it off, but most people can't."
Striking-Extreme8920,"Hello, Republicans, **age discrimination in hiring** is rampant after one turns 50. 

Where do they expect people to work even if they are still able to?

Oh that's right. Republicans don't care. 

Republicans suck."
AnonAmbientLight,"Republicans would rather raise the retirement age to 70 than to tax the insanely rich people in this country a penny more.

Fucking ridiculous."
Gruffstuff2021,"Republicans have been trying to kill Social Security since 1935, if people keep voting Republican they will succeed."
grixorbatz,"It was raised in 1983 from 65 to 67.    So my retirement age relatives in today's age are choosing to retire at 65 anyway - because they're damned ready to.   Thing is, they collect less of the money they put into the system because they're not 67 yet.  

It's hard for me not to see this as a mechanism for squeezing retirees out of the hard earned income dollars they're due."
PMMEBITCOINPLZ,"The Hell of it is they craft these things so it will affect younger people in the future, not older people now. They’re banking on the fact that their older voting base will be willing to support them screwing the young, or at least not stop supporting the GOP if they do, and they are probably right."
BicycleParking5977,Why do republicans hate this country so much?
Appropriate_Chart_23,"Hey young people. 

Pay attention to what I’m saying. 

It’s time to start paying attention to politics and start getting out to vote these greedy geezers out of office."
Choice_Voice_6925,"Party of death misery and destruction: check.
Voting right wing is akin to  anti-patriotism/sadism."
notoriously909,"I worked with a guy, late 60’s, couldn’t afford to retire just yet but in “maybe 5 more years”. One day he complained he didn’t feel well; that his stomach hurt. He went home for the day then went to the doctor the next. It was the last time I ever saw him. He had pancreatic cancer, stage 4, no treatments, only comfort of life care. He had been working for that company for 30+ years and couldn’t afford to retire. He died working."
Za_Lords_Guard,"Riding past that it's cruel to the retirees, doesn't forcing more people to work longer in life displace new generations of workers and delay they getting a start with opportunity.

So effectively penalizing multiple generations for not being wealthy enough to not need SS retirement income."
Prestigious_Gear_297,"The French unions just cut electricity to politicians and the wealthy as Macron tries to raise retirement age to 64. The unions are supplying free power to schools, hospitals, and the poor. Let's take some pointers people or this will only get worse."
gamergirlpee69,Peasants must toil so the ruling class can live freely.
Orwick,"Republicans need to realize that millennials have replaced boomers as the largest voting block. As a generation they are getting to the point where take retirement planning more seriously. 

Last decade when Tea party republicans talked about raising the retirement age, boomers were the dominant political generation."
URABrokenRecord,"Meanwhile, the people in France are protesting to keep the retirement age 62. People keep asking who would pay for this. Either the govt needs to make the wealthy pay what they owe OR a 2% tax for people making a mil+ a year OR stop spending so much on defense."
chunkmasterflash,In France they were having protests about raising it from 62 to 65.  Here?  Barely registers.
Silently-Observer,The point is they want people to die before they get to retire so then they won’t have to pay for benefits at all and can use that money for themselves.
EnjoyWeed1,Elections have consequences. Vote like your life depends on it because it does. Vote blue.
gunnesaurus,It’s not like I wasn’t gonna work till I die anyways
Nstarlite1,"Well, they also want to gut Social Security so we'll all need to keep working right up until our graves in order to support ourselves. Makes sense to me.

(This is sarcasm.)"
Helstrem,"This would really fuck over anybody who works in trades.  Jobs like plumbers, electricians, construction and so on are really hard on the body.  65 is already a big ask for people in those lines of work.  70 would be brutal.

Republicans need to learn that not everybody is a lawyer with a cushy office job."
PandaMuffin1,"Work till you die it's the American way! /s

Anytime someone tells me the US is the greatest country in the world, I am filled with rage. I especially love the ones who tell me that while disparaging the poor and homeless people."
TintedApostle,Republicans don't do solutions.  They do cruelty.
punkindle,Guess which states have the lowest life expectancy. The answer will not be even a little surprising.
culdeus,By all means make sure you leave a cap on taxable earnings to SS though.
Charyou-Tree,"""You will work until you die and own nothing and you will like it!""

--GOP

""Yes daddy, just be sure to hurt the libruls and brown people more!""

--GOP voters"
hibearmate,"Raising the retirement age is just another way to cut

fuck these greedy assholes

i have worked since I was 15, have incurable cancer at 50, and probably won’t see 60.

The idea that I still have to generate a profit for a corporation (aka a legal entity that exists on paper to protect wealthy people from their own personal mistakes) to justify having healthcare and to stay in my home, which I bought AT 50, is horseshit"
greenmonkey66,It needs to be lowered not raised.
Ixneigh,Conservative voters apparently don’t care as long as no lgtb books are in grade schools.
TheBlueBlaze,"Economic plans like this are why moral panics and antagonism are the bread and butter of the present-day Republican party. The false bill of goods Reagan sold the country, that deregulation and tax breaks for the rich would *improve* the economy for everyone, is proving to not be true. But conservatives and their lobbyists want more money, while their voters want to think they'll eventually *have* more money, so they can't just backtrack on the benefits for corporations and the 1%, or concede that pure capitalism isn't a good idea.

So now their big idea to ""save the economy"" while ensuring their private interests don't get affected is to gut what little assistance the government provides while putting more burden on the middle and lower class. But since conservatives actually *like* social security (because it's a government benefit for them) and obviously would hate more taxes, Republicans have to constantly distract by claiming to be fighting the ""groomers"", the ""communists"", and the ""woke moralists"" by simply not being Democrats. And the base eats it up, because apparently someone to blame for their problems matters more than actually fixing those problems."
abelenkpe,Fuck Republicans
FlyingApple31,"Fuck Republicans.  

No, seriously.  They are a threat to the well-being of most people in this country, even those who consider themselves Republican.  We need to fuck their shit up for good."
fupoe69,"GET YOUR 401K GOING NOW, THE YOUNGER THE BETTER. DO NOT WAIT."
BigStatus8740,I don't understand how this roghtwing minority has any power.  You rural landlocked Americans are incredibly fucking stupid.  Stop voting against your own interests.
Jedimastah,"And the people will do absolutely nothing about it, at least France had the balls to say enough is enough"
Asphodelmercenary,"Now that Boomers are aging to the point they all have Social Security and Medicare, they need to wean their kids and grandkids off it. It was only for them. If they could live to 120 on Medicare they’re ok watching their kids die at 55 or 65 from lack of health care. As long they get theirs."
v9Pv,"Like their 30% s sales tax plan, this is an idea to hurt US citizens and help republicans’ wealthy and corporate bosses. And since they campaigned with zero platform and hav even less of a platform these awful legislative proposals are obviously being fed to republicans by those who have bought them and control their weak asses. Pathetic and cowardly."
rollicorolli,R's don't care. They only care about preserving the wealth of the wealthy. The rest of you can go to hell.
Mcdibbles,This is false.  Republicans don't want to raise the retirement age.  Republicans want to phase out the concept of retirement completely and make sure that from ages 6 through 99 you are working for some rich asshole's dollar.
Erinite0,"As someone who works with 70 somethings regularly... yeah, nearly none of them are in shape enough for that. I mean damn. Assuming I even live that long, that's like what 5 years before my body breaks down? Oh boy, great to work my whole life for a couple years of relaxing and then the sweet embrace of death. This life sure isn't what was promised to me that's damn sure. Fuck anyone who isn't a lefty at this point. All this shit needs to burn."
Lamorra1773,Fuck republicans.  Expand the Social Security tax threshold.  I hope younger voters sink these idiots.
gknight702,I just don't understand how middle and lower class people think Republicans are the issue for them? They literally never it's legislation that benefits them and try to pass legislation that hurts them.
s4burf,They really are running out of demographics to offend. That a lot of foxsnooze watchers they're fn with.
Spectre777777,Retire them from Congress.
KaleGroundbreaking,Funny thing is a guy I work with is less than a year away from retirement and that's all he keeps talking about. Shame he voted for Trump and the republican party. Oh well. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Cuck-In-Chief,They’re not on our side. They’re only interested in monied interests and keeping themselves in power.
Office_Depot_wagie,"So they're running on a religious extremist, anti gay, anti women, anti kids, book burning, reactionary, anti government, pro insurrectionist, and now anti senior platform?? How... how do these people get elected.

Oh that's right, they say ""I love Jesus"" and that's all it takes."
shillyshally,"No, what they want is no retirement age because they want to nix both Social Security and Medicare."
OkSample7,"I dont know how many times I’ve said this in my life but I’ll say it again. 

I’m so fucking glad I’m union. Full pension at 58 and I’m done. No way I’m working until 70."
LordSeltzer,"Are they trying to cause unrest? Because old white men cannot exist forever and ever and they're angry? I don't get it. Are these politicians in bed with prison industries? It seems as if the GOP is trying to keep inciting violence when you glance over at France right now. 

Just concerned. The end game seems redundant. I like the theory these old white men are angry that society is standing up to their outdated ways that serve the insanely rich(not you, small biz owner. The People are on your side.) CEO types making millions a year for doing not much else besides being born into the right family. At who's expense? The majority of us. All of us carry these greedy, mentally ill rich people on our backs. Trickle down has been **debunked, over and over.** And they're mad. Big mad about it. 

Just my theory. I hate seeing what the world is coming to these days. It's sad and comes at a cost of incredible loss of advancement for our greater collective society. For what? So less than half of one percent can own multiple yachts? Nonsensical. So sick of this virus."
ramdom-ink,"This is ridiculous. Wait until you get past 60 and realize every bone in your body aches, for a half-hour after waking. Life expectancy is barely past that in the US after the Covid mortality effect. This is tantamount to torture and elder abuse, not to mention they don’t wanna pay pensions. Pricks."
Jtthebest1,"Insane that instead of improving people's lives, they just want us to work for longer. Holy hell we need to strike already."
i-have-a-kuato,"It’s the party of the people who want to make sure everyone has a job!

of course wage and cost of living as well as zero benefits just so long as you can get your lazy as to work"
bisskits,Republicans are a fucking disease that need to be delt with. We will never progress as a species with them around.
HolyIsTheLord,"Until Americans are ready to rise up as an entire country, I'm tired of all this outrage porn. Either fight for your rights and put elected officials in their place, or shut the fuck up."
Partigirl,"They started this shit on my generation (gen jones) by pushing the retirement age up for us first. Now they want to push it farther ahead---again. It's been like this our whole lives, big ""charlie brown and lucy/football"" vibes. Thanks for nothing."
pandamander,Republicans have figured out how to lock down the white blue collar vote thru stoking the right kind of hate and paranoid conspiracies. Maybe still being republicans who truly hate their voters will cut thru the populist bullshit.
RonPolyp,"The neoliberal ""libertarian"" ideal is that workers work until they die unless they can somehow manage to stuff away enough of their pittance to fund a few more years of life after they get too feeble to work.  This is not hyperbole or exaggeration. This is the ""ideal"" situation, according to right-wing thought. Anything resembling a social safety net is ""communism"" or ""socialism"", and that picks the pocket of the ownership class, thereby impinging on their ""liberty""."
ironmaiden7910,That’s horrible.  Maybe Congress can also make the mandatory retirement age for politicians 70 to get these out-of-touch geriatrics out of office.  F them.
CAHTA92,Time to cosplay as FRENCH PEOPLE.
tosser1579,GOP: We aren't goin to touch Social Security... we are just going to change the retirement age for the younger crowd so they never collect.
TBone281,They will take it away altogether if given the chance.
007meow,"They want to raise retirement AND cut social security/medicare.

And the elderly Fox News crowd will still vote for them."
whiteonblackspecial,"Look at what's happening in France. If we don't do the same, no US citizen is allowed to talk shit about the French again."
king_platypus,Does it make sense to take early social security and move to a low cost country like India or Colombia?
Vash108,"These fuckers really need to be forced to use the same healthcare we do.

Maybe we need to set congressional age limits"
fjrnate,If you have a very physical type of job good luck working to 70.
davechri,"Employers do not want 70 year old people working for them.

This is just a republican ploy to force people to take their social security before reaching full benefits."
busted_up_chiffarobe,"I'm going to be 54 soon. I expect to live to see the following:

* Elimination of SS by the time I need it
* Sales of national parks, etc. to cover 'the debt' (pushed by Republicans)
* some red states turning into permanent Republican led ""Christian"" theocracies 
* California, western Oregon, and western Washington seceding from the union 
* Red states plowing into deep third world status after the loss of blue state funding.
* Incredible poverty for the elderly for the bottom 75% (wow) in the nation
* angry young people fighting an 'election system' the Republicans have gamed against removing them from power

Yee haw, here it comes. Hope the ruse of fighting abortion and the war on Christians was worth it!"
CapricornBromine,"same shit, different day; America is such a depressing place to live. 3rd world country with a Gucci Belt. The saddest thing is, if we pulled out heads out of our asses for once things might change.

I won't shed a test when it burns, assuming I live that long."
Crazy-Nights,"Well, what do you expect? The tax cuts for the rich that Trump helped them pass counts for like a quarter of our national debt. They gotta pay for that somehow"
Buck325,"They want slaves, what’s so had to understand? That’s why they want more police and more prisoners, only form of slave labor still legal. That’s why they don’t want to pay you more and work you to death. Slavery is the ultimate form of capitalism, real easy to understand if you’re educated, which they also don’t like, see any republican controlled state for examples."
Grey_Duck-,Hopefully it comes with mandatory retirement from elected office at 70 too. Or 55…
Handy_Dude,"These articles should read- ""voters in red states want to raise the voting age to 70."" Or similar. 

They need to know they are responsible for all this BS."
redditingatwork23,Retirement is going to be synonymous with death if they keep fucking moving back the goalposts. If anything it should be moving the other way. 61 is the age that makes most sense to me.
Templar388z,I hope we riot like France. I’m down if it happens.
apitchf1,"Take away the racism, sexism, and classism. Who supports these clowns? Like what policies do they have? Work more, for less, in a world that the environment burns. Woman have no rights and everyone has an ak47. Like really I cannot think of a single position they hold that isn’t trying to be intentionally inflammatory. They’re like the kid in class who sits there and says annoying edgy shit just to say it. Any reasonable answer and they find the opposite of it because “I ain’t no soft hearted liberal!!1!!11!!!”"
Junior-Passion4253,"They've killed off more than a million people just with covid.  Ridiculous Healthcare costs kills millions more.  We need to lower retirement age so people can actually get it.   If they don't get to claim social security,  the heirs should get $50,000."
steveycip,Pay into SS your whole like just to work until you die. While they feed us crap that causes us cancer so we can never get what we’re owed.
xRowdeyx,"Nail in the coffin,  I'm officially switching from Republican to Democrat."
Zestyclose_Price_441,What’s the point of even working anymore
StrangeBedfellows,For people who supposedly want smaller government and less change they sure do change a lot and get involved in my life on a regular basis
KingDorkFTC,Why do old people keep voting for old people that have no desire to help old people?
Dmoney0117,"Republicans view the general public as nothing more than a source of income. This is why you see such a strong push against abortion. Conservatives dont care about being pro-life, they want more poor workers so rich people can continue to exploit them."
GOPGUNLUv,Let’s Riot like the French!!!
