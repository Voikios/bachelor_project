buttstuft,Came running to the comments to read about that shitty chair.
Peazo,This is the 2nd husband post I've seen recently where the poor guy is sitting on the modern equivalent of a church pew.
kalel1980,"Dude needs a nice, comfortable chair now."
atjones111,"Whatâ€™s up with these posts of people having nice ass living rooms to just have a folding metal chair as the gaming chair they use ðŸ’€ (you commenting women is why, grow up)"
HighHungryHorny,Are pizza and chicken nuggets the dogs' names?
SkavensWhiteRaven,"Love it. Spends thousands on couches, plays on a fold out chair.
This dude is having an out of body experience and the chair is just where he leaves his body."
Initial-Camel-8440,Its funny because one of the biggest positives that console gaming is supposed to have over PC's is that you are gaming on a comfy couch as opposed to a desk chair.
Real2Retro,On a chair of despair...
cl--,sitting on a folding chair right next to the couch feels like a type of punishment bad little kids get
BunsonBoi93,Reddit moment
UnsettllingDwarf,PSA your couch doesnâ€™t need to touch the back wall in your living room.
tnnrk,"I donâ€™t blame him for playing on a shit chair, that TV is waaaaay too far away from the couch."
synphony5159,"Forget the folding chair, what's up with people putting their couches like 50 feet from the damn television?? Why is your furniture so far away from your electronics that you need to place intermediate furniture in-between the two??? JUST MOVE THE COUCH CLOSER TO THE TV"
Underrated_unicorn,Are youâ€¦ chillin in the dog bedâ€¦.?
evel-kin,that chair must hurt after an hour or two ...
KoolerMike,"Next, get him an amazing gaming chair."
hwooareyou,Are those 3d printed puzzle gift boxes on the coffee table?
MaggyMaggot,"Nice, he needs a new chair though or a giant beanbag"
replicant4522,r/shitpost
IAMIACEE,A guy playing video games.   Thanks for sharing.
Sparky_San,This is his natural habitat. Leave him be.
TevildoPrinceOfCats,I'm absolutely certain this was chair rage baiting for karma
BeginningGas3569,Came here to read the comments about that shitty chair.
PizzaButWhoseBiden,Stupid post
hellaangeles,"Why do I feel like this is the same dude that posted the other day about how his wife won't let him get a gaming chair because of her ""aesthetic"""
KingdomZeus,"He'd be even happier if he was in a proper chair

\*wink and nudge towards wife"
Savagewizard,He's in the FPS chair. Tell him to sit on the couch and enjoy the game.
NoddyIM,Be careful about keeping the ps5 in a place without a lot of ventilation.
DASreddituser,I feel like im the only dad on reddit who just uses a recliner for his gaming chair. It's either a folding chair or a desk chair lol
The8thHammer,"This whole ""wife lets husband enjoy hobby"" meta is really making me worry about some of you fellas."
gr1mR36p3r,"And his wife who is happy to let him enjoy the moment :) nothing could be better than that!!
Ps. Lovely dogs :)"
BigMik_PL,"All these husbands need to grow some balls and play kneeling on the carpet hunched over the coffee table like the real Gs.



On a serious note tho. Some games are intense and you just have to sit closer than optimal viewing experience from the couch. It's easier to just pop a chair then move the entire couch lol. I also wouldn't want to spend more money just for a better gaming set up when a cushioned folding chair is good enough."
SoreBrodinsson,Your husband is Kratos on a diet of pizza and chicken nuggets
rosingods,"Say what you will about the chair. I think this is very wholesome :)

Thank you for sharing"
Esmethequeen,"is he a veteran? im sure his back is fucked up after serving, get that man a nice chair!"
Alternative_Gold_993,Surely they could just move one of those comfy looking seats up??? That looks so uncomfortable
whitelelouch2,Dogs: woman where are our chicken nuggets and pizza?
AnselmaLo,it's a pity that pets have more comfortable beds than your husband's chair
Drevlin76,"Get this guy a real chair, please!  Preferably one that is ok on his back."
ghjiiytre,"Also Iâ€™m disappointed in the comments a chair is a fucking chair, grow up, people"
WretchedRat,He definitely needs a better chair to be in a happy place. He might be in a tolerable placeâ€¦for now.
LampertSchade,Kratos be playing as Kratos
Foreign-Crab-4179,"Some of you are a bunch of ""game snobs"". Let this man be. His wife posted this as she was obviously thrilled to see her ""King"" in his happy place. Maybe this man is a hard working man taking every paycheck to provide for his family and it was either have a ""gaming chair"" or GoW with pizza and nugs. I play GoW in my gaming chair because it happens to double as my office chair with me working from home. My personal experience woth GoW..I prefer to sit in a comfy chair to further immerse myself into the remarkable story of this game. But who am I to judge how someone decides to experience this game?"
Alice_Buttons,Do male redditors not know how to make purchases on their own? If he wants a different chair he can buy one. OP is not her husband's mommy and he's clearly enjoying himself.
MoParNoCaR23,"Honestly, nobody gives a fuck."
ChampOfTheUniverse,Here goes Reddit making an assumption about how a guy is treated bad because of a chair even though weâ€™re just seeing a photo of a guy having a good time playing a game that his wife got him while heâ€™s grubby down.
Xyrektv,How gracious of her to allow him to do what he enjoys in his own home. Maybe one day he will be allowed to own his own chair if it pleases her.
Original-Law3467,Why the fuck are these men being relegated to folding chairs in their own homes? This dude is allowed to have a hobby and take it seriously.
leo_x_alky,Love it! GET HIM A BETTER CHAIR FOR HIS BIRTHDAY! Sorry I got too excited lol
CupICup,One day heâ€™ll even stop eating chicken nuggets
Empanah,"Lmao I went straight to comment about the chair, 1 week after the other dude chair post"
Forsaken-Dog4902,Not in that chair. Get that man a real chair.
Sternjunk,Why you making this man sit in the Lumbar Destroyer 3000 lmao
Soonermagic1953,What is it with you women making your man sit in a folding chair while gaming. You should be more considerate of his needs. Itâ€™s not all about you. Iâ€™d be willing to wager that heâ€™s the main breadwinner in your household and you treat him like this. Wow
mped14,Get this man a new chair stat he's gonna hurt his back.
One-Significance1735,Chair! Chair!
ShalomJackieeeee,I came here to say he needs a more comfortable chair but it seems everyone had that covered.
SomeGuyIncognito,"Don't get a gaming chair, get a desk chair that supports your lumbar back."
steve-the-beef,Good Wife!
deadliestcrotch,Is your husband the guy that posted a folding chair in front of a tv like this in a living room like this to demonstrate the suffering caused by his wifeâ€™s aesthetic demands? Asking for a friend (or maybe to incite drama for lulz)
teelops,At least your television is at the correct height.
Beavshak,That all sounds wonderful.
coast9k,I'm so jealous rn
Crissaegrym,Get him a nice gaming chair or nice sofa next year.
homer_3,Why would anyone sit in a crappy folding chair when they have those nice leather ones?
Takingbacklives,My manâ€™s gonna need back surgery after
Lefthandedscientist,With two lovely doggos too!
baaya88,Lucky man to have a great partner.
c0smicgiggles,Thatâ€™s a happy man right thur
Prelives-19924,Heâ€™s our husband now
someguyyoutrust,"Oh sick, I got fucking socks again for Christmas."
Spork-in-Your-Rye,I know *exactly* where he is in the story lol
New_Cause_5607,Next Christmas can you please buy your husband a chair that doesn't look like it belongs at a church picnic. And maybe years supply of gift cards to a chiropractor for his upcoming back problems.
calebthelion,Can someone please get this man a chair!?
_NightmareKingGrimm_,Kratos with glasses playing as Kratos.
Bimlouhay83,Your husband looks a lot like me. Even my daughter asked if that was daddy. Lol
sean_themighty,"Everyone is saying he needs a better chair, but really the couches should be arranged for life and how people actually use the space. Couches should never simply be pushed up against walls in space that size. Get that couch and that TV to work together so you donâ€™t have an r/tvtoofar situation."
Yung_5quire,Treat yo man to a new chair whilst your at it god knows he's needs it
papaver_lantern,The hell is he sitting on a fold out chair for?  I  do not think he is maximizing his happy place.
Arthes_M,Poor guy needs a gaming chair. Feel bad for his lack of lumbar support.
busstees,He's in his happy place until he has to fight the Berserker King or Gna.
Pennywhack,"Why isn't he sitting on that comfy couch instead of this back breaking, ass flattening chair?"
Little_pog_champ,I love the feeling when you come home tired from work and you can just sit down and play games on bluestacks without any problems.
ZealousidealJoke3319,"Give the guy a proper chair before he gets back issues. 

But I'm super happy to see a positive gaming post from a wife. Good job."
norealtalentshere,Get that guy a gaming chair
Different-Guide-1287,"Next Christmas, a more comfortable chair."
mombi,This is the second post I've seen with people using some folding chair to sit close to a big tv when there's a sofa just behind them... Why?
SoggyAttorney1,He is... and the fact that you support and enjoy his  passion shows wonders for the health of your relationship.
Plxburgh,Dose t he need yelled at for having a good time?
tcurry04,I want a Christmas PS5â€¦the one I have is just a regular non-Christmas PS5 :(
southpaw05,Get him a proper chair and he will be in a more happier place
DefinetlyNotJJ,get him a proper gaming space you monster
Conscious-Client6688,Poor dude needs a half decent chair to sit in.  Even just a basic Ikea office chair would be a HUGE upgrade to this.
LankyLizard82,That man is living the dream right now
HereForTheFood4,Not on a chair like that.....
ShubaltzTV,I like this compared to posts where the person's partner clearly hates their hobby and doesn't seem like a healthy relationship.
RoddyRoddyRodriguez,Until he rage-quits
Ruffalobro,That chair isn't a happy place
plaidverb,"OMFG, please buy this man a comfortable chair. 

Iâ€™d much rather be comfortable while playing a PS2 than play a PS5 while sitting on a cold, hard, plastic slab."
thewend,"bro the lazy boy is RIGHT THERE, just move it for your back's sake"
GoneRacing2,"That looks awfully uncomfortable. 

Is he not allowed a better chair that wonâ€™t destroy his spine?"
bjammin97,This guy isn't sitting close enough! I want immersion!!!! I don't want to see the edges of the tv in my peripheral vision!
bootyhunter69420,Is this the same guy with the aesthetic wife? Get that man a chair.
SomewhatSaIty,All he needs ks a better chair and he's in thr perfect place
Zestyclose-Number224,Either sit on the couch or get better glasses my dude
jerkstor,Doubtful especially seeing the chair he's sitting in looks more like you've given him a moment of respite from your maelstrom of marital needs.
rabb1thole,Please get that man a decent chair to game in. One that doesn't cut off circulation to the legs and provides better support for the back.
spilldeer,It's as simple as being in the same room as him while he does it that probably makes him so happy.
afterlife_xx,He'd be happier with a better chair.
NiceBoysenberry4944,Donâ€™t just feel it. Know heâ€™s happy
Tungsten_Cloud,"So cool. I also get a chair to sit closer to the TV, haha."
Lazy_File1543,You did a great job wish I could find someone like you
PxavierJ,Not in that chair he isnâ€™t
iflabaslab,Domesticated kratos playing with real kratos
virtiousredditor,"I'm actually relieved that he isn't trying to play from one of the nice chairs. When I see people do that I'm like, no way you can read shit from there."
yeoldevagabond,My ex used to bitch and moan about moving the couch closer to the TV. Women don't even know how hard it is to 100% stealth kill an outpost on Farcry when you can't see the badguys.
raw-power,"Was gonna comment on the chair, then saw the other 1000 comments on it alreadyâ€¦. Proceeds to comment about it anywayâ€¦. He needs an ergonomic office chair (not gaming chair) and his setup is complete!"
Impossible_Daikon233,Get the guy a real chair. Thousands onda table and bro is on a fold up. I don't even own a TV or a gaming console and I think that chair is ridiculous
SirBing96,Heâ€™d be happier in an actual chair
