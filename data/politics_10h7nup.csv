AssociateJaded3931,All of Trump's lawsuits are frivolous. His whole life is frivolous.
TheGoodKindOfPurple,I am sure it's just a coincidence.
TheBelhade,Frivolous lawsuits have been his bread and butter for decades. About time he's gotten slapped down.
BstintheWst,Indicating that the  case brought against Letitia James is knowingly frivolous
clearly_central,So this validates Leitita James probe to all the deniers.
idletooth,"Trump: Russia collusion witch hoax! Most unfair hitjob in history! Greatest victim! Even worse than Jesus and Emmett Till!

This judge: Oh my god, shut the fuck up"
gasahold,Trump is a stupid fat fish flopping around in a frying pan.
TintedApostle,Hey can we the tax payers get all the money spent on these false stop the steal defenses put up by State governments in the last 2 years?
Special_FX_B,More judges should follow this lead. trump is the example used in the definition of frivolous lawsuits.
K1ttredge,They already filed the lawsuit.  The judge should refuse to allow it to be dropped and hit him with another fine.
natenate22,"Pretty sure he'll pay the fine with stolen ""Stop the Steal"" funds or stolen Campaign funds.

Or stolen tax payer dollars from overcharging Secret Service for rooms.

Or stolen tax payer dollars for Golf Fees

Or stolen tax payer masks and ventilators resold by Jared's private consortium."
Toadfinger,You know Trump is on the ropes when he's losing his hamburder money.
charonn0,"> Trump and Alina Habba, his lead attorney in the Clinton case, are liable for $937,989.39 in legal sanctions. 

There should be a rule that also confiscates whatever money Trump paid the lawyer. Make it clear to other lawyers that this sort of thing is a money-losing proposition."
Idek_h0w,Huh? Imagine holding someone a little accountable for their actions and then they don't do more unaccountable bullshit. Funny how that works...
GeorgeWhite1953,Trump starting to lose even bigglier. Dial Truth messaging way past maximum.
jeffinRTP,Hopefully they will make him pay the fine
Lil_Mikey420,He only dropped it because it was going to be presented to the same judge in the same courtroom.
NarfledGarthak,"Too bad a judge couldn't still say, ""well this looks like bullshit, too.  Here's another fine""."
spaitken,"Wow, imagine what might actually happen if ALL his actions had consequences"
jchowdown,LOL what a tool
I_make_things,"So what you're saying is consequences work?

Huh.

I wonder if that same concept would have worked in other cases."
paintsbynumberz,"And to think, all of his nefarious dealing would have never seen the light of day if he didn‚Äôt run for the presidency. He could have died with dignity choking on a hamberder on his golden toilet. Sad"
flatdanny,Was Trump getting tired of losing?
Tagurit298,"Frump is a petulant, spoiled, ignorant, selfish, narcissistic, racist, hateful child.  Just like his idiotic followers."
McNuttyNutz,The judge clearly told him  if you bring this shit in front of me you will get destroyed üòÇ
chakranet,Bok bok bok
dnchristi,Should have made him personally hand a check to Hillary.
Neapola,Those who've been attacked with frivolous lawsuits need to sue him for costs and damages.
Kevinmc479,Big Fat runnin low on dough.
newfor_2023,Oh you mean there are consequences to being a dick? Who knew?
HookEm_Hooah,"Well, well, well, if it isn't the consequences of your actions."
new-6reddit9,The mother fucker played - chicken and lost $1 million :) is about time the ‚Äúlaw‚Äù catches to this conman!
HeadSavings1410,Wonder if he's sick of winning yet
BoomTownRat71,He‚Äôs still losing.  What a pathetic Lil Man.
YesterShill,"Trump was punished for acting like a toddler.  

Time outs work for misbehaving children."
BlanquitaNJ1,All he does is sue people? I have to wonder why his followers consider him so tough. He talks the talk and then hires lawyers. Wtf kind of tough guy is that?
afishda,Frivolous Trump should be his name the only way he survives without any consequences throw money at his problems and see what sticks.
jakeb1616,That‚Äôs more than he paid in taxes over the last 6 years!
StormSolid5523,trump should be tried under the espionage act for stealing hundreds of top secret classified documents
tommasz,"Filing frivolous lawsuits only works when the other party can be bullied. Every time he tries to do it with someone who is willing to stand up to him, it fails."
rubeninterrupted,"See, the little piggy can learn."
SteamStarship,"Douche bags love being douche bags when it costs other people their reputations, not so much when it costs them a few dollars.  It's pretty clear what TFG will listen to.  I just wonder how many judges he appointed that we now must count on to reel him in."
SeenItAllHeardItAll,Let there be finally consequences. A million may not move Trump but his lawyers seem to be getting the message that there is a real downside risk going any further under his direction.
ggericxd,they also removed it ‚Äúwithout prejudice‚Äù meaning he can refine it. he‚Äôs likely judge shopping it.
maninthewoodsdude,"Trump : Proven Loser.

I know. You know it. Everyone knows it. Big League Loser energy."
NowIsNew,"r/mademesmile

r/oddlysatisfying

üòò"
PHASENDREHER,Trump is a monster.
Calm_Cap_3405,"Obviously go after Trump, that's a given. The realy key in stopping this stuff is to go after his lawyers for going along with this nonsense. Start disbarring lawyers and pretty soon they stay away like the plague."
DrHob0,"In 10 years, Trump will be dead likely from some form of colon cancer. Until then, I hope the justice system hounds him every step of the way to his grave. A small price to pay for what he did to the political spectrum."
Susan-stoHelit,Counter suit for costs then
defconkepler,"Because, just as it was in his apprentice show... Trump is _the_ joke. Simply, no one told him that..."
WrongSubreddit,Consequences work
dogchowtoastedcheese,I swear.  That fucking guy.  Sheesh.
Norph00,Someone's running out of fucknl you money.
SilverMt,Maybe he's starting to realize the judicial system may have finally had enough of his harmful nonsense.
clarityculprit,thank you Your Honor for actually using your status to enact some accountability on this asshole for once.
SaintOlgasSunflowers,He's finally beginning to have some real and meaningful consequences for his behavior.
egoVirus,He‚Äôll probably declare as a loss for tax purposes üòÇ
Loreki,"I think this may be the most effective fine in the history of fines. For a man who claims to be a billionaire, he's been very motivated by losing only one one-thousandth of his wealth."
jm0127,So much losing baby!
neutral-chaotic,"Hey, looks like there are some lessons he can learn!"
BostonSamurai,"All he does is takes L‚Äôs, there‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs been a joke since the 70s. He‚Äôs a loser and always will be."
SpankyMcDangle,"Almost 1,000,000 bucks is nothing to him. He can just come out with another superhero card and his loyal (and shrinking) troglodyte treason Trump train will fund his stupidity for a few more years."
AbaloneDifferent5282,His lawyer should be disbarred she‚Äôs still spouting The Big Lie
rocketwidget,"The backstory here is Trump sued Hillary Clinton and 30 other people ""for the Russia Hoax"" in 2016.

He filed it in Florida, again hoping to get Judge Aileen Cannon, the nutjob Trump Judge who was essentially running defense for Trump in his illegal Mar A Lago activities before the notably, extremely conservative 11 Circuit, smacked down Judge Canton.

Instead, he got Judge Middlebrooks, hence the million dollar sanction.

Again, he filed the NY AG lawsuit in Florida, hoping again to get Judge Canton. Instead, he was assigned.... Judge Middlebrooks."
GetRichOrDieTryinnn,Trump is a loser. A childish loser. He made America look dumb again
PuckSeattle,Fine him another million. Help reduce the deficit
Realistic-Farm-6559,"If this was done back in the day,Trump never file another lawsuit."
Lamont-Cranston,Doogie Howser: It's afraid!
actuallychrisgillen,"I‚Äôll be damned, he can be taught."
hannibals_hands,I guess all those fools who bought Trump NFTs actually wound up giving their money to Hillary
tesaril,He can learn?
TempleOfDoomfist,Trump is a loser. The best loser!
redneckrockuhtree,"Did Trump drop it off his own volition, or did the lawyer tell him it either gets dropped or he can find a new lawyer?"
FilthyChangeup55,Man it‚Äôs almost like Trumpty is a really shitty conman ü§î
williamfbuckwheat,If only judges were willing in the past to sanction and fine Trump like that for his constant frivolous  legal maneuvering/lawsuits instead of waiting 40 years too late to do anything about it...
Lika3,"The real 1% are laughing their ass off as they are not targeted as everyone looking the other way, they are learning the limits of what they can do I guess"
AXXXXXXXXA,His whole brand is Losing now
AtomicBlastCandy,"Question for lawyers, can that judge hit him for his Letitia suit even though he‚Äôs dropped it?"
Tellurian_Cyborg,Dropping or abandoning lawsuits is a common trump tactic. He does this so that he can say that he sued <Insert Name> over <Insert Reason>. In trumps mind this somehow means that he won.
Odd_Status_9326,He doesn't have a million to pay the fine. Time to ask for a favor from some Russian oligarchs again.
ThaxReston,Orange grifter Loser
Fatesadvent,I thought he was a billionaire. Surely 1m would not deter him right???
Commercial_Board6680,Why it took so long for judges to come to this obvious realization is part of the reason why we regular-ass people don't trust the judicial system.
Tanukisus,He's a scared little boy ü§£
bluenami2018,Fines seem to have got his attention‚Ä¶ Interesting.
groundhog5886,His attorney wanted to deflect another charge.
Autumsraine,"Why is it that judges not in the justice department have no qualms about doing this, whereas within the government sectors, DOJ are quiet?"
NapaAirDome,So 1 million hurt him that bad. How much (financially) does he have to lose?
Ashleej86,Yay consequences.
Smkweedevrydy,Fkin LOSER
jimngo,The reputational harm to the law firm is incalculable. Why did they file a lawsuit so frivolous as to have been shredded to pieces by a judge? That law firm is done.
Helpmepleaseohgodnoo,Good. Fuck this Hitler POS
SybilVimesDragon,"And if more judges did this, at least 25% of cases would never be filed..."
ClobetasolRelief,Fucking moron
Harak_June,"Huh, who knew consequences for bullshit would stop more bullshit?"
FriedEgggsCorpse,Trump is cash poor
TheDunadan29,The wind isn't blowing his way anymore. And he knows it.
xeonicus,"This should be far more common, particularly with rich asswads that like to throw around frivolous lawsuits."
Alternative-Flan2869,See - he‚Äôs such a big-mouthed liar and an even bigger COWARD. This is the face of the republican party - the bigly loser.
Soulman682,Starting to look like he‚Äôs forced to start pinching pennies. He‚Äôs not as Rich as he advertised (shocker üò±) ü§£
CaddyFDT,This idiot is losing so much he must get sick and tired of losing
ShlomoShogun,"Mmmhhh, I‚Äôm going to have to get use to his new nickname, ‚Äúnot so teflon Don.‚Äù"
peterabbit456,"Well, here is the amount that acts as a lever to get TFG to stop with the nuisance lawsuits: Fine him a million for this one, 2 million for the next one, 4 million for the one after that, and so on."
Roondawg13,Who‚Äôs playing ‚Äúpeekaboo‚Äù now?
Realistic_Expert717,Oops
Tom_Neverwinter,She should sue him for a frivolous lawsuit lol
DirtWaterAir,He‚Äôll grift from the gullible QAnon believers to pay for this.
_bigbubba_,What a loser. Lock him up.
WentzWorldWords,"Only a fake billionaire would care about a paltry $1,000,000"
spookycasas4,Wow. This is the only relatively smart move that this piece of shit has made.
Workflow77776,Love it
Divasf,Question is: will he pay the penalty? He always stiffs vendors.
NightSavings,"*See, only a jackass would do such a thing. Such a stinking bitter man. As long as he is around on the Political front, America will not return to it's once great self*"
buck70,"""Ha-ha!"" - *Nelson Muntz*"
redmasc,"So he owes her $171,631 for her legal fees. LOL"
ntsmmns06,Why hasn‚Äôt a judge declared him a vexatious litigant preventing him from being able to bring any more baseless cases before the court?
mkt853,Pus\*y. Ron DeSantis wouldn't have dropped his lawsuit. So much for the alpha male.
SmartOpinion69,"i hate trump and all, but fuck the lawyer. i think that the lawyer of the frivolous cases side should be responsible for ALL fees on both sides. bad lawyers are no better than bad cops"
bluebastille,You see?  He **can** be taught.
PositionParticular99,Almost as if he knew he would lose and have to pay a bunch of money.
Unlucky_Clover,It‚Äôs almost like accountability works!
StrangeBedfellows,Gee.
GooseNYC,"Weren't his lawyers dealing with the DOJ in DC caught joking about how his defense or something was as empty as his pockets?

He's got to be hemorrhaging cash. Sure he has some deals overseas but I would say him becoming President and all the fun thereafter did not do much to increase his brand's value domestically.

I cannot imagine Alina Habba (sp?) has it and I doubt her e&o insurance will cover it. And Trump sure isn't coughing up the funds on her behalf."
sweetoledevil,Trump is showing how weak he is. I don‚Äôt know why the right thinks he‚Äôs a macho macho man
Jerk182,"Please, send this orange dump to the cleaners. He's been asking for it for a very long time."
rxjalapenosnatch,"I doubt he will ever learn a lesson, but hit that mofo where it hurts: his pockets."
FastFingersDude,Who knew that consequences worked to stem bad behavior. Hm.
Naive_Key_7418,Yes!  There is a God !!!
IronMan7777,Now. What could I do to get him to sue me?
Hourly-,spend the trading card money
captainjackass28,The guys like scroog mcduck holding onto every cent he can con and steal. He threatened another judge after he refused to agree to do what he wanted after he mocked one of the many women he‚Äôs raped.
MrClaretandBlue,Thought that thumbnail pic of him was Quagmire. Giggidy.
DreadSeverin,so you can legit pay to obstruct justice. America is truly great
egoVirus,He‚Äôll probably declare as a loss for tax purposes üòÇ
errandwulfe,"‚ÄúMr. Trump, do you, as you claimed, have evidence linking Leticia to law breaking?‚Äù  
‚ÄúAbsolutely. I have several photographs that will definitively prove‚Äî ‚Äù  
‚ÄúMay I remind you that you are under oath, and that if you lie, I will fire you and have you prosecuted?‚Äù  
‚ÄúNothing. They will definitively prove nothing. You cut me off! Hah hah. I don‚Äôt have any ‚Äòevidence‚Äô! Oh, your honor, so silly. Okay, bye guys! Leticia! Have fun with this trial! Yay!‚Äù"
bonowzo,"a clear case of sterling principles

until sterling is involved"
TransformativeOne,What's a million dollars to somebody that grifted 250 million dollars most recently to fight whatever it was he was claiming he was fighting. It's not his money. It's other people's money and he'll keep grifting them until he or they pass away.
Successful_Initial67,Dude has sued over 4000 times so he's dropping the one against Ms James cuz he's a nice guy after all..
massivetypo,Trump‚Äôs deep sense of commitment to what he believes.. what a POS
Pontoonfiend,Oh
cool_arrrow,"‚ÄúNever surrender, never back down‚Äù üòÇ"
RoninDelta1970,Th list of things Trump is and was ‚Äúgonna‚Äù do but never did is longer than my schlangus
Rstrofdth,So the orange turd can learn.
3Heathens_Mom,I guess the phrase ‚Äòmoney talks‚Äô might actually mean something to 45.
Disqeet,Justice is back?
maxxspeed,"It sounds like he had some self reflection and realized he was wrong.  Hahaha, no he didn't, he just realized it was costing him a lot of money."
Independent_Prune_35,"About time, the courts are getting tired of frivolous lawsuits! Should fine the lawyers also!  Fine seems very small compared to what he hoped to avoid? Just like the one about the tax scam they had for years! 1 Million dollars and they saved how many millions?"
pailkedv,"Why is $1mil such a big fine for trump? It's the same as me having $3,200 and made to pay a fine of $1."
OzzyDad,I bet he never paid that fine.
dadudemon,"Title is misleading.

Reality: Trump finally agreed with his lawyers after weeks of them pleading with him to drop the case."
Charity7758,"Well, that ain't gonna work anymore. What other tricks do you have up your sleeve, tRump?? I'm sure you've got plenty of others. LMAO!"
civilly-disobedient,The best lawyers
ScottieRiver,Fat orange must be tired of losing
Cliffwbland1,It‚Äôs just a fine his not going to pay or trick the republicans to pay or his followers with a different scam why can‚Äôt this shit stain just die
Media_Club,Did you heard about [Intelligence Artificial ](https://free-trial.adcreative.ai/7jlyzkoqdg3d)
dancingmeadow,He's finally run out of lawyers I think.
Different-Air-2000,Trump getting soft. Acting like Texans‚Ä¶
metfan1964nyc,Remind me again about all the winning he was going to do.
