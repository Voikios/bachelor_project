Level 43, got my heart racing, my armour zeroed and my heals gone. I hear footsteps coming... He heard me too... Scav voice line. \n\nI voiped \"hey man! i'm a Scav! Are you a scav?\", oh man I could hear the happiness in his voice \"yes I am a scav!\". I tell him \"come inside! lets get together\" only to blast his face the moment he crossed the door.\n\nI Felt kinda bad, but in that specific situation I could not trust him.", "ID": "10eahmm", "Score": 1575, "Total Comments": 787, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10eahmm/whats_the_worst_war_crime_you_have_done_in_tarkov/"}
