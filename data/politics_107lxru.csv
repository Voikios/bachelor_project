ionstorm20,"I distinctly remember asking someone like 6 months ago ""What are you going to do if they decide in January 2023 as a thank you for voting for them, that they need to cut social security and Medicare immediately?""  


Their response was basically ""Well, they wouldn't cut mine. I paid into it.""   


So I reiterated, ""But what if in January they vote to cut SS/Medicare and it passes and starting in October 2023 it's not available to you anymore? Ya know. As a thank you for voting for them and a checkmark to filling out a campaign promise""  


Their response was ""Well if they do cut it, it obviously wouldn't take place for like a decade. Which is fine. I'll get what I paid out of it, and those folks that don't deserve it will have to deal with the consequences of their actions"".

joepez,"I’ve got nothing against a strong military but I don’t understand comments like “not on the backs of our military” and thus state defense spending cuts are off the table. 

The success of our nation is built on our people. It’s the reason our Constitution starts with “We the People…” not we the soldiers or I the king. Without a stable and happy people there is no country to defend. 

Cuts to the military (or any program) should be on the table as much as increasing revenue through taxes. The stance that social entitlements can be cut and other areas of government is asinine. 

You can’t undermine the population and pretend like it will have no impact. People aren’t living rich lives dependent solely upon government programs. They’re just living and in many cases on the contributions THEY made with THEIR tax dollars. And I’m pretty sure We the People can decide if we want to take care ourselves."

hidden_giraffe11,"From the article: “I’m all for a balanced budget, but we’re not going to do it on the backs of our troops and our military,” Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.), a former Army Green Beret, said Monday during an interview on Fox Business. “If we really want to talk about the debt and spending, it’s the entitlements programs.”

So social security (paying old ppl to live since they aren’t capable of working) and helping people afford basic healthcare is an “entitlement” now. 

I know several people who work in the military realm. They literally piss away money. Those are some of the most entitled people I’ve ever met in my life. 28 yr old married couples making 120-140k annually working basic ass maintenance jobs with no degrees. PLUS $1,500 a month in living stipends, plus free strength trainers, plus free physical therapist, plus free mental health programs, plus free dietitians, plus free healthcare at brand new hospitals on base, plus free childcare, plus paid for higher Ed if they want it… 

but yeah, it’s those damn poor people making 35k a year begging for basic healthcare that are destroying America. Along with those damn retired people that built this country just begging for scraps. Hoping to got not have to work part time jobs at 80 or having to pass on 100k in debt bc they had to live in a nursing home for 3 months before they die. To hell with um, right? Fkn entitled poor ppl looking for handouts.

The irony of military members who live in a socialist society screaming at the top of their lungs against socialism all while wanting to cut others “socialist programs” so they can have more funding for theirs.. it’s almost unbelievable at this point. But hey… that’s the republican way 🤘🏼all for me and not for thee"

Rather than balance the budget by increasing the tax contributions from those that at the top of society the only solutions they choose to acknowledge are to give less to those at the bottom. 

Oh no! the deficit has gone up! It cant possibly be due to an endless stream of tax cuts for the wealthy. Nope, its definitely entitlement programs that have got to go."
Space_EnggDSP-KY-8,Oh great! Whatever happened to the “we’re in control of the house and we are here to take care of the American people!” By cutting our benefits?? Nice one.

So what IS a benefit that should be cut?  Lifetime healthcare for elected officials."

Well, you see now that you were so passionate about a party winning instead of whatever their “platform” was, I will never experience those benefits. Thanks! I hope you are able to leave me a fat check in a few years or whenever none of this matters to you because you will be dead and whatnot. No worries. At least they’re owning libs and shit. Just eatin babies and space lasers and teaching about racism that happened about 60 years ago.” Fucks"

However, a party known to do this kind of shit over and over again still gets voted in.  These kind of politicians shouldn’t exist.  Even if you, the redditor reading this, didn’t personally vote for them.  Enough Americans are voting them into office.  It’s ridiculous to give such power to people who are actively trying to ruin you.  

I had always laughed about how it used to be communists you’re so supposed to hate and then it’s terrorists.  I feel like at this point we can just make up any word for the people to be against and it will work.  

Oh wait, GOP leaders talking about the dangers of foreigners in the country and is married to a foreigner.  GOP leader constantly going on about the dangerous homosexuals being allowed to exist, get caught in homosexual extra-marital affairs.  Then we are supposed to worry about all the pedophiles and groomers out there when in all likelihood it’s the GOP housing all those awful pedophiles and groomers.  

It’s a total shame that there are people still voting for this party to exist."

alternativeaccpos2,"To be fair, conservative voters love their social security, medicare and welfare being cut. Should just let them have it."
EmmaLouLove,"We saw how MAGA Republicans held McCarthy’s Speakership hostage.  Will Republicans really hold our economy hostage, refusing to raise the debt limit unless cuts are made to Social Security?  The GOP’s threat to Social Security and Medicare is real.  

When Republicans stand in the House and give their speeches on why we need to cut, as they say, “entitlements”, always remember that photo of former President Trump on the lawn of the White House surrounded by GOP members laughing, hugging and having a great time right after they passed massive tax cuts for the rich and corporations.  

Whether Republican or Democrat, I doubt there are many Americans who want the GOP to cut these programs we have paid into for decades. 

Just like Republicans who railed against “Obamacare” for years, with the mantra “repeal and replace”, there is no GOP plan.  The only GOP plan is to dismantle federal agencies, cut “entitlement” programs, and give more tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations."

OmegaMountain,The irony is how many people who voted for this crap will also get screwed by it and *still* not learn. My mom is hardline GOP kool-aid nutjob and she's been on disability for years.

unkleknown,"As a CITIZEN of the United States of America, I love my country but HATE the current state of things.    


The left seems to be okay, with a few wackos, but the right just seems completely off the deep end.    


I was reading an article last week about people in Iran killed for being outspoken about the government and I got to thinking about how that seems like what the Repugs are looking for. They keep advocating violence.  I imagine they want to get to the point that we are like Iran, someone says something they don't agree with and POP!, they are dead meat.  


This is like the current gerrymandering process but without having to worry about someone moving to the wrong (White Anglo Saxon Protestant) district at some point in the future.  


Consider how the Democrats get rolled over because they don't advocate for violence but the Repugs just yell bullshit over the top of them.  The Repugs basically want teachers to carry guns to protect kids in schools because violence is the solution, instead of regulating gun control.  

&#x200B;

I'm a gun toting liberal if that makes sense and I feel that is our right, but not to abuse it.  I don't open carry generally (but if you are a cyclist on the road and have a sidearm on your hip, cars will give you a wide berth, grin). But I would probably be considered mostly stable.  I sure as hell am not my dad who has said in relation to the House and Congress, ""I should go to Washington and kill all those democrats"". Yea, he's one of them. If he were healthy, he would have showed up at January 6 to pray and then spray with his rifle. Sick Fuquers.

&#x200B;

The Repugs treat politics like religion and used to treat Trump like he was the second coming of Jesus the Christ. I felt he was exactly that dude from the book of Revelations that is basically Satan, looking all slick and cool and telling everyone what they wanted to hear whilst giving it to them in the arse.  


Am I done Venting?  No.  Now they want to start cutting the benefits for the old retired people.  Most of them old fuckers are republican so good luck, kill them off and see that you repugs never get voted in again.  


Here's what I want to see. The idea is from some old Si-Fi book - A politician that is elected to serve has to turn over all assets.  They are no longer wealthy, but instead receive a stipend and have a modest home that represents the median of their constituents. They cannot be given wealth, they cannot be involved in anything that pads their accounts - it's all public record.  Only those Citizens of USA (not Americans because that includes all of North and South America hahaha) who truly have the heart of a servant and want to see society grow will do well.  If they lift up their consittuents, they lift themselves up.  


No politician would ever vote for this because they don't want to be normal.  Politics is the place for greed, narcissism, and debauchery and that's why previous civilizations have failed and so are we."

frequentlyconfounded,"Aged boomer here. For you young’ins who may not know much about Social Security and Medicare: average monthly Social Security payment is $1800 (mostly taxable). Medicare Part B costs $165 / month and due to Medicare shortcomings most of us geezers buy a “gap plan” at around $150 / month. That means most of us are living the high life on less than $1500 /month before any federal and state taxes. Of course, we mostly have (hopefully) some other income but the larger point is there is NOTHING about senior programs that is remotely generous. In fact, they’re downright stingy by any reasonable standard considering we’ve paid into these programs for decades. 

The real problem, of course, is unconstrained healthcare costs but Republicans would never want to tackle THAT problem because, hey, that’s Socialism, and we wouldn’t want anything to constrain the magic of the marketplace /s."
