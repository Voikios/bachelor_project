rpapafox,"> Republican lawmakers said during debate on the Ohio legislation that even if Trump’s claims aren’t true, the **skepticism they have caused** among conservatives about the accuracy of election results justifies imposing new limits.

Skepticism that the GQP lawmakers THEMSELVES manufactured and amplified."
bunkscudda,"So fucked up how they got here. Republicans used to love mail in voting. Their base has a lot of old people that find it more convenient. For a long time the GOP relied on these voters.

It wasn’t until Trump’s horrific response to Covid that it changed. And because trump tried to write covid off as not a big deal, anything related to acknowledging it’s reality was therefore an attack on him. So since mail in ballots would help with covid distancing, they became ‘Anti-Trump’ and should be stopped.

Who knows how much better their votes would be if they didn’t demonize mail in voting. Even 2 years after the loss, they are still continually shooting themselves in the foot just to humor their biggest loser."
thomcrowe,"Let me get this straight 
-	you don’t like mail-in ballots because the demographic that uses them isn’t your demographic
-	you knowingly make false claims about fraud though mail-in ballots
-	people believe those false claims with absolutely zero evidence
-	because people believe the lies, you want to punish the people who use mail-in ballots?

To quote Zoolander, “I feel like I’m taking crazy pills.”"
WaterChi,"> “While there is certainly more work to do, this new law drastically enhances Ohio’s election security and improves the integrity of our elections, which my constituents and citizens across the state have demanded,” [Republican state Sen. Theresa Gavarone] said.

How? More vague, baseless bullshit. Creating fake problems to disenfranchise people or outright taking their rights away is a core Republican strategy.  It's one of the characteristics of fascism."
T1mac,">“What kind of society do we call ourselves if we are disenfranchising people from the rights that they are over there protecting?” said Willis Gordon, a Navy veteran

This is something the military families should have extensive first hand knowledge about. 

It's called ""Collateral Damage.""

In order to count fewer Democratic ballots, some other people will get hurt. But how else will the Republicans keep their claws on power if they don't cheat?"
RamonaQ-JunieB,"They (Republicans) only care about the military because of the defense spending and contractors who give money to them. Full stop. When it comes to actually doing anything for the people who are doing the work in the field, they don’t give a shit. Yet the ethos of the military has convinced them that if there’s a R next to their name, you should vote for them."
upandrunning,"> The pace of ballot counting after Election Day has become a target of conservatives egged on by former President Donald Trump. He has promoted a false narrative

I can't think of a more sugar-coated way of saying that ""he lied about the election results as part of an attempted coup against the US government""."
well_uh_yeah,"I mean, the GOP does not care about military families and constantly does things to show them that they do not care about them, but still many military families will support them."
NuclearNap,"I recall—a year after enlisting—registering as a Republican because they were the “pro-military party”.

As I matured thru my military career, and seeing all of the attacks of the GOP’s War on Veterans that I was blinded by their unsupported propaganda. Leaving the party in ‘16 was decades too late."
unholyrevenger72,How important are military bases to Ohio's economy?
Neilpuck,It's amazing to me the number of veterans and active military who support the gop. The GOP has a long history of taking action against the benefits of any military personnel current or veteran. When will they open their eyes and see this.
vertigo72,"I was deployed to Iraq in 2020. Mail took an average of 38 days to get to me from the states and 42 days to go from me back to my home address.

Good luck fellow military members from Ohio. I hope you enjoy watching other people take part in the democratic process while you sit on the sidelines."
rengothrowaway,"They are also working to dismantle the VA. They have nothing to replace it, they just want it gone. 

Stop voting for the people actively working against you."
shapu,Don't interrupt them!
Sasselhoff,"When they can't win by actually getting more votes, they cheat.  It's been shown time and time and time again.  I sure wish more people actually gave a shit about this country, instead of just caring about ""their team"" and how well they ""own the libz""."
KnudsonRegime,"The GOP is clearly willing to sacrifice the military vote to pander to the lunatics. Military voting for Democrat in the presidential race jumped from 20.6% to 41.3% between 2016-2020. 

The military vote has become a liability for the GOP."
spaitken,"“I can’t believe how WOKE our military culture has gotten, expecting to be able to vote.”"
nonamenolastname,And yet they will continue to vote republican.
Whiskey_Fiasco,It’s so frustrating watching all these communities be surprised pikachu face every time Republicans do exactly what they promised they would do.
MyEvilTwinSkippy,"The GOP will do anything to support the troops...


...except actually supporting the troops."
FilthyChangeup55,They weren’t already mad about the GOP denying them health benefits?!?
B4rrel_Ryder,But will the military stop voting for them?
The_Pandalorian,Military members who vote Republican are getting what they voted for.
david-writers,"Glorious Leader even admitted it on camera: if it is easy for citizens to vote, the fascists would not have political power."
SevereEducation2170,"Pretty much no one who isn’t a wealthy, white Christian man should ever vote Republican."
Zippier92,Why any military votes republican is beyond me.
Zanchbot,"And yet many of these same military families vote, and will continue to vote, Republican. Make it make sense...."
Yodelaheehooo,GOP does not now nor have ever cared about soldiers or their families. The military is Slush fund to take from or a cudgel to oppress outside markets. Anyone who thinks otherwise can get their face eaten off by leopards
nova_rock,But they'll still vote for them.
Turkino,"Don't forget, this is on top of constantly reducing the post office ability to be reliable.

My whole life I could count on the USPS to get mail in on time, now my local branch is understaffed, only runs 2-3 times a week, and has lost packages coming to me."
CodeWubby,"Military families have been spouting rage at the GOP and even have trump the lowest approval rating the military has ever given, yet they are so brainwashed they vote red in droves. Fucking embarrassing"
Walker_ID,I'm sure this won't prompt the heavily conservative military voters to stop voting Republican
FUMFVR,"Republican priority #1: Keeping people from voting. Especially by mail.

So smart for a party whose base is becoming more immobile by the day."
Mahaka1a,"GOP = 

Gaslight

Obstruct

Project"
was_and_wasnt,"Add up all the active duty military and retired military and you have numbers far less than all other major racial groups in this country.  You have numbers far less than those indentifying as LBGTQ.  In short, the military is one of the smaller groups in this country.  Republicans attack much larger groups than the military.  They do it all the time.  Was only a matter of time until they began hitting the military."
KrookedDoesStuff,Doesn’t the military also vote overwhelmingly in favor of the GOP most of the time too? Seems like shooting themselves in the foot
hoyfkd,"By that logic, the skepticism about the extent to which the GOP has become an arm of the Russian intelligence services is enough to justify going after it as a foreign terrorist organization.  Even if the claims aren’t true, the skepticism is justification enough."
SimbaStewEyesOfBlue,And yet most will continue to vote for them....
Carwash_Jimmy,"Republicans attack democracy. Every story is the same. Republicans attack democracy, elections, public education, human rights, equality and justice. Every story is the same. The media works tirelessly to keep us from connecting everything the Republicans are doing - because the media is colluding with them. Rise up good people - promote democracy in your home and defend it in your community. Defend democracy!"
new-6reddit9,When are people going to understand Republicans are now a threat to American freedoms!
Tokyo-MontanaExpress,"I mean, most military families vote Republican, right? Feels rather r/LeopardsAteMyFace."
teriyakininja7,And yet somehow most military families I know are staunch GOP supporters. You get what you vote for.
Blurry12yo,"Support the troops! They nobly sacrifice the right to vote so that the GOP can maintain minority rule!

It’s in the bible."
Hyperion1144,"But they're still gonna vote majority republican, aren't they?

I have a hard time finding sympathy for people who vote in favor of their own abuse."
losthalo7,"Q: How does making the timeframe shorter make things more secure, Governor DeWine?

That question should be getting hammered by the media until it's answered honestly that it *does not* make voting more secure, it only makes it more difficult for active military serving overseas to vote.

The lawmakers that voted for it should be getting *skewered* for disenfranchising active military voters."
thebaron24,Oh look. Military families voting for a party that limited rights and voting power for segments of the population getting mad when that same party's tactics affect them. Sounds like a conservative mind set to me.
AccountHuman7391,"They’ll still vote for Republicans, however."
ColdRefreshment,Military overwhelmingly votes for the GOP. Stop enabling assholes if they’re working against you.
kandoras,">Republican lawmakers said during debate on the Ohio legislation that even if Trump’s claims aren’t true, the skepticism they have caused among conservatives about the accuracy of election results justifies imposing new limits.

Republicans admit they lie, but say it doesn't matter because enough of their voters are gullible enough to believe their lies."
AKMarine,They are clearly willing to disenfranchise military families if they can also disenfranchise a very large portion of the Democrat voter base.
burdfloor,"The only voter fraud is the Republicans lies.
Attorney General Barr clearly stated, voter fraud is bullshit."
bigt503,"I love how the right some how has the pro military narrative…. Despite voting against their health care and voting rights any chance they get. 

Being pro bombing random brown people doesn’t make you pro military…"
AceCombat9519,Is this part of the GOP plan to destroy postal ballots because they see it as giving advantage to the democratic party.
Bluccability_status,Voting restrictions have no valid reason or moral worth to exist. It is simply a tightening of the choke chain to them.
DrRichardButtz,"The GOP and its bigoted voter base knows it can't win elections, it can only steal them by keeping people from voting. 

Gaslight, Obstruct, Project."
Sissy63,"Considering the new right wing Republicans that are now in charge want to severely cut our Defense budget, it’s gonna be best for them if military families can’t vote.  Suppress all voters who don’t vote your way."
hamsterfolly,"Let it be a lesson, the Republicans will only fane support/care for a particular group or demographic as long as it suits their need. Once that changes, Republicans will drop that group or demographic."
More_Cowbell8,"Newsflash military families, the GQP doesn't give a flying fuck about you!"
releasethedogs,When are boots going to learn the GOP doesn’t give a fuck about them?
Radi0ActivSquid,"Over here in Nebraska the GOP are trying to get rid of mail-in ballots. In our new proposed VoterID law require ID, eliminate early voting and severely restrict mail-in ballots to only the military and homebound."
An_Squirrel,"If you were in the military, a veteran, or family member of military. And your GOP for a fucking asshole hypocrite, fuck head 

The amount of bullshit the GOP has cut from its actual troops is fucking disgusting. Just like they do with everything else. It wasn't until Democrats were in office till I could even get seen by the veterans affairs office. Let alone get any effective treatment."
Pinyaka,"I mean, the GOP is already trying to defund the military."
TheAskewOne,But but but... Republicans love the troops!
PoptartMartt,The fact the gop still exists in 2023 is weird.
Substantial-Hat2775,"Most GOP actions should anger military families, especially the veterans…"
Olderscout77,"Apparently GOP market analysis found some Dems in the military, so they want to ease the life of service members and their families by eliminating the stress of actually voting from their lives. Just another way (in addition to decimating funding for base housing and cutting support to PX and Commissary) the GOP deals with our Military so there's more money for the defense contractors."
BarCompetitive7220,"   In everyone's spare time,  check out the meetings of ALEC and state SPN meetings, where Corporations go to write legislation that goes to GOP state stakeholders.    Or just get on the mailing list of Sourcewatch.    [https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch)

No, I am not employed / affiliated with that group.   Just a reader"
chapeksucks,"What happened to ""support the troops?"""
yodadamanadamwan,"All these conservatives in the military yet every time the gop tries to take benefits away or reduce resources for vets or this shit... Like learn your lesson the first time, they don't care about you"
Zandt88,"You want to know how much Republican respect and admire the military? Just look at how they forced the military to repeal the covid-19 vaccine mandate in order to appease their base. They literally removed safety precautions against a plague to get more votes. They wave a military flag but only to feign support so they can feel they have a 'big stick' in their pocket when they want to force their will on others. They don't give a damn about the military, just what they can do with it."
twocannnsam,are they still voting for the GOP?
crazy-diam0nd,It’s not like that will stop them from voting Republican.
stclvr53,GOP looking to screw over the military voters!
zoroddesign,"Hmm, I wonder if the GOP cares about the military? Checks voting history. Only when it makes them money. Otherwise, no."
Ashleej86,Good. Piss off the military. Please gop
OptimisticRealist__,"The last GOP president literally called POWs losers and KIAs suckers. 

Yet republican voters have the gaul to propagate their patriotism and love for the troops lmao."
GlitteringPear9761,The irony that many of those same military families voted for these very candidates is probably lost upon those voters....
doc_block,And yet they still vote GOP reliably enough that the GOP isn't worried about losing their support.
scribblingsim,"“Support our troops!”
“Not like that!”"
JulesHaggard,"Since it's been shown repeatedly that only Republicans commit election fraud or voting fraud, how about we set a limit of 4 days after the election for receipt of ballots from registered Republicans, and 10 days for everyone else?"
khornflakes529,"The first presidential election I ever voted in was via mail from Fort Benning.

Republicans are NOT real patriots, they are sad little hypocrites."
SnooSketches6409,Republicans are not as pro military as pretend.
PM_Me_Your_Sidepods,And they will still vote R despite the GQP using them and throwing them away.
CutiePopIceberg,Theyll keep voting red anyway. Even though it means a higher chance of being deployed with nothing but half a kevlar vest for protection.
McNuttyNutz,And they will still vote republican
MC-Fatigued,Yet military members will continue to vote for the death cult…
,[deleted]
Realistic_Expert717,They hate mail in ballots by the left because it gives those democrats who can't get to the polls or those democrats in urban areas where the GOP has closed so many polling another option. They forced areas across the US in left leaning urban areas to wait in lines for HOURS to vote and they want to force people to vote in person A) because it gives them the opportunity to prevent those (Ds)who don't have a DL from voting and B) conservatives vote on election day and not by mail in ballot so limiting vote my mail/forcing vote in person gives them an advantage through their manipulation of voting laws. Right-wing magas are too intellectually challenged to vote by mail or they already do but are to consumed with sticking it to the libs to realize they're fckn themselves over. Last time I voted I saw multiple elderly white voters in wheelchairs being brought in to vote and immediately I'm like why tf don't they vote by mail.
cwn01,"Really good Republicans, piss off the military families.  /s
The Republican Party needs to become the party of intelligent conservative reasonable honest leaders. Let the scam artists and yahoos create their own Yahoo Party."
ftyftghryht,Yeah they support our troops
ClassicT4,"Trump really wants to commit to doing away with it, but someone must have informed him about key demographics to the GOP, because even is most targeted attack on mail-in voting is followed up with “except out-of-state military and elderly with mobility issues.”"
S1R2C3,They will promptly ignore the anger and continue to say they love the military.
sbsb27,Seems self defeating. I thought most military members generally vote Republican.
RTrover,"Luckily I live in a pro-democratic state of California. I have 30 days to fill out and return my ballot. Sucks to live in fascist states ran by GOP. Yah, the gun laws suck but who needs 30 rounds magazines to blow through tons of ammo, I get to practice mag changes more often, and you can still own AR-15, they just look dumb. I focus more on pistol now than rifle."
w2ltp,This belongs on /r/leoaprdsatemyface
jonoghue,"Seems like all Rs want to do is piss more and more people off, even if its their own voters."
hairysnowmonkey,Military service personnel who vote Republican are masochists.
texinxin,The most comical part about this is the military vote is typically GOP.  So not only are they clipping their own direct votes of active deployed military they are also pissing off veterans who largely vote GOP.
huu11,"It doesn’t seem like a smart political move to disenfranchise your base, make it harder for military members to vote and strip money from Medicare - who is the GOP trying to help (the 1% of course)?"
BarCompetitive7220,"As a reminder:  Ballots are mailed TO these individuals 45 prior to E-day.   Assuming zero errors, etc reducing the available time for delivery to County elector to 4 days...what could possibly go wrong.   :-(

[https://www.fvap.gov/eo/overview/sending-ballots](https://www.fvap.gov/eo/overview/sending-ballots)

Reminder:  increasing / standardizing the time that States had to send out these ballots was celebrated by GOP - now they are looking for a way to disenfranchise military votes - my how the times have changed."
Findilis,Just wait until they find out what Republicans do to the VA.
jazzismusic,"They’re so angry they’ll continue to vote GOP, just to send a message!"
FPOWorld,"News flash:

The GOP does not care about the military except contractors who donate to their campaigns."
DantifA,Why do republicans hate military families?
buttzted,The quiet part: “We need to keep blacks and browns from voting” thought Newt Gingrich…
strain_gauge,Law enforcement and the military were the GOP's safe votes.  In the last two years they've attacked them several times.  What the hell is their long game?
athensugadawg,(R) just pulling all the levers and seeing which shit sticks on the wall.
Smoothstiltskin,"Republicans hateses democracy.  Hates it, hisss."
JanFromEarth,The GOP does not believe in citizens voting. That is why they work so hard to prevent it.
SithLordSid,The GQP lawmakers don't give a F about the military and they only use them as a prop when it benefits them.
susanreneewa,"That one Republican said her constituents demanded the ridiculously aggressive change, so she HAD to do it. Therefore, I DEMAND gun control. Did it work???"
Impressive-Listen-37,What makes anyone think the republicsns won't do anything to HURT our military and think anything of it
TroubleshootenSOB,OCONUS folks should have been flipping out about the USPS snafu.
Msmdpa,Always vote early by mail or in person
crispy48867,"Just the GQP's way of trying to win over our military voters.

Great plan."
Helstrem,"So instead of telling their radical base the truth about election integrity, telling them to educate themselves before believing conspiracy bullshit and to suck it up if they can’t do that the GOP thinks it is better to disenfranchise citizens as a performative act?

Fuck them."
LimpBusiness69,America is dead. We lost. Fuck.
Long_Lost_Loser,"When these issues arise and we see the GOP’s responses, I am glad that I’m retired from the military and no longer am subject to having my rights stripped from me.

This is another demonstration that the GOP doesn’t really care for or consider the military members themselves. Similar to the banning abortion without considering those service members who have no choice on where they are assigned and having their rights stripped from them. 

The GOP is more interested in being in power and using a myth that they are looking out for the military. But, in reality, they use the military as a show piece and act as if they care."
wisepunk21,"I still remember 1992 when I was in grafenwoehr, Germany for tank qual.  I was up in the morning watching the election count on TV when the mail call guy gave me my absentee ballot. It was the only presidential election I didn't get to vote in.  The county elections clerk thought mailing it out 8 days before the election was enough time for me to get it."
Tito_Bro44,Will that anger translate to action?
iiitme,As it should.
Dapster777,"ALL military …..SINCE THE USA spreads its wings across the globe to secure peace, have been given the blessing of doing mail in ballots ( IF ) they are overseas."
tiddayes,Conservatives owning liberals by preventing military conservatives from voting.  The republicans are about to own the dems right into another term in the White House
baron_spaghetti,It pisses of every American living abroad (eg. working or diplomatic) but somehow the anger of military families is more important than everyone’s collective anger.
Cauldkiltbaws,If you think any current sitting GOP member of Congress gives a damn about anyone other than their mega donors and lying to the public to keep their jobs…you haven’t been paying attention….
tf199280,They don’t want people to vote and have said that
extracensorypower,"In other news, Republicans are shocked, *shocked* that the same laws used to suppress black and brown urban voters can be used just as effectively to suppress rural white voters or overseas military voters who might support them.

Meanwhile republican house members take aim at their other feet..."
GuaranteeCreative954,GOP doesn’t give two shits about military families they’ve proven that time and time again!
BostonInformer,"Hey Reddit, it's been almost a week since we first heard Biden held classified information [and they literally just keep finding more](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/14/1149071576/biden-classified-documents-what-we-know). Reddit consistently talks about how he wasn't their first choice but ""he's better than Trump"". If he really isn't your president, why has this never once in almost a week made it to the front page? Especially the fact that they literally found some of this stuff in November and we never once heard about it until now?"
ligh10ninglizard,"War is coming soon...hope you're storing weapons and water. Less than 10yrs, collapse. Economic, ecological devastation like never before... less than 10yrs. War is coming to our shores. Prepare for a time of zealots and tyrants. Men of force. Take away the rights of the common man and woman. Slowly, the noose is lowered over the neck of democracy. War is coming...free men will not lay down. It's how this nation was built by the blood of men and women willing to sacrifice all for an ideal. Freedom isn't free, and the military understands that best of all. Now you take away their right to be heard... free men will not lay down. Continue down this path, and War will be at your doorstep. Less than 10 years."
MR-313-717,😂 everyone in Yankee land always getting offended… can you kids just stop being offended for 5 min… that would be just great ☕️
