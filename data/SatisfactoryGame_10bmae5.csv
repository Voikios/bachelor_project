Yui_cake,"*And I not used Reddit before so I don't know all mechanics of posting yet (excuse me)*  
*But I read rules already...*  


*Here I just would like to save energy on pumps so built Coal Energy Stanchion Block-type right under water layer... so deep with generators on every 6 floors. This was creepy to build a little.*"
MeltsYourMinds,First glance I was sure itâ€™s a post from r/subnautica
