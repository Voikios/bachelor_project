Oldenodd,"""...redesign the whole thing. Again."" FTFY

Yeah, that's just a normal day for me. I have redesigned my nuke power plant four times now and still am not entirely pleased. I guess my corporate overlords will just have to be patient with me."
Periferial,"As soon as I finished my HMF factory, went hard drive hunting. First one I found was the Heavy Encased Frame. Ripped it all up and started again"
Matix777,Mental development is progress ig
TheOGPotatoChild,I’ve restarted my main save twice to organize it differently cause I’m too lazy to tear everything down
Due-Consequence9579,Is that better or worse than me trying to build a factory and getting distracted by side projects of side projects? Spending 4 hours on a water tower is completely normal… honest.
0LowLight0,"1 MILLION iron rods!

Stage 1: *Muuaahaha!*

Stage 2: *M-hehehe*

Stage 3: *heh*

Stage 4: *hm*"
realamericanhero2022,This is the way
sselesUssecnirP,Am I the only one who makes a rough design in their head for every factory and just bullshits through it?
python_artist,That mental work is important. Otherwise you end up wasting a ton of time building something you find out doesn’t work for you
senshikaze,It's just like work!
tren0r,you dont need to spend time REdesigning it if you do any designing in the first place!
TheRealOWFreqE,"Or when you start the game up and decide to only optimize your logistics / aesthetics.
""Progress"""
finalizer0,"I'm 200+ hours on a megafactory and I'm still fighting the urge to totally redo a part of it because I didn't realize there was a recipe for packaged diluted fuel that I could already use before T7/T8. Could free up so much oil for rubber, plastic, coke steel..."
cynric42,"I get to that point in the game rather quickly where I can't be bothered to rebuild anything that kinda works because building feels so much work and really clunky.

Not sure if it is just me, but I'm really missing some quality of life features to make building the bigger stuff less of a chore."
cchooper1,That still counts as playing!
Kubrick_Fan,This is the way
W34kness,"I mean you could just change the expected output…

Nope time to rebuilt the whole thing"
