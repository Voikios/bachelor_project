Sorry."
PsychologicalTowel79,"That's exactly what I did. I also tried a Fibonacci cannon, but it was rubbish."
Menkes,The strongest shape.
dragontimur,"wait, where do i see the map?"
kb041204,Ficsit approved
Qaetan,The length looks good to me!
Party_Magician,"No, this is perfect. Now just slightly adjust the exit angle each time you try again, and youâ€™ll get the whole map revealed in no time"
MakerGaming2022,Real Civil Engineer would approve.
jonnywah,It launched you to the tip of the map.

Green_Submarine7965,"Fortunately when launch yourself too far and die to the world border, crate with your items will spawn at the cannon's location (speaking from experience)"

Eric_Bigglesworth,"I've done that before, thankfully they've made it so the resources drop at the cannon and not out of the map."

Collistoralo,"Nope, that seems about right.

vincent2057,"If you survived that, very well done sir."
DaddyMc-Bye,"Nike, Just do it.."
SovietSonic,n i c e .
YourAverageSnep,Obelisk cannons are more effective
Lemme_eat_your_pvssy,"I never bothered with HT cannons, other than the controlled ones I could get out of at intersections by slowing down (assuming I was paying attention and didn't let myself pick up enough speed to not be able to slow down when I wanted to get out). The vast majority of the map I uncovered by hunting down all the crash sites and other things (8 left over hard drives), though I do wish  we had a digging tool and the finder had an direction indicator in the z axis (annoying when something is supposedly right on top of me but it's 200m below me in a cave)."
MarioGeier01,"It's ok bro, it looks like ficsit logo, so they forgive you :)"
