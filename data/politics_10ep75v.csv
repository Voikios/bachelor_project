iceflame1211,"The woman that said they would've been armed and would've won if she led the January 6th rally, is now on the Homeland Security Committee. 

Make it make sense, America"
mtarascio,Sounds like something that was given up for the Speakership.
sugarlessdeathbear,I wonder how many major things will just get missed because they're too busy trying to score points with their base in the media?
Joeyfingis,They make it so obvious they're trying to be terrible at running the country on purpose
Bringbackdexter,"This should terrify everyone, she literally suggested for martial law to assist what would be a failed attempt at a coup on Jan 6 with no consequences. Surprise surprise they‚Äôre trying again. To reiterate in case someone missed it, there is an active coup that is being enabled by parts of the government."
Altruistic-Program-1,"This is America. Take part in a failed coup, remain in congress, and get a job in homeland security."
MintBerryCrunchJr,Maybe her years of harassing victims of school shootings prepared her for this important role.
Salvia_McLovin,She's a literal domestic terrorist enabler.  She stands for the terrorists who tried to have the certification of the 2020 election stopped by violent means.
,She literally has zero qualifications for this role.
windle,These fuckers are out of their goddamn minds.
Plzlaw4me,"And there‚Äôs your proof that they don‚Äôt actually care about these things. Any committee with MTG or Boebert is a committee the GOP doesn‚Äôt give a shit about, but thinks the base cares about. If you actually want to get something done, you assign boring, career politicians who understand legislation and how it is passed. They‚Äôll be boring and bills will go through. If you want to grand stand and rile up the base while doing nothing to help, you assign MTG.

Edit: for further proof look at ways and means. It‚Äôs one of the most powerful and important committees in congress and none of the members are house hold names. They are necessarily good or bad, but it‚Äôs safe to say their goal is to not constantly be ok on camera with something flashy

Edit edit: it‚Äôs ways and means not weighs and means"
shed1,So this is why she pretended to disavow Q.
waterdaemon,I bet she can provide some valuable insight into the Capital pipe bomb mystery.
internetbrowser23,This is not funny anymore. The people who have access to such important positions need to be competent. This isnt just shitposting on twitter anymore. God forbid that we are attacked or something happens and we have MTG in charge of investigating it. Our safety is in jeopardy
LifeSage,They put a Russian asset on the Homeland Security Committee.
Timpa87,foxes guarding the henhouse
AlertThinker,Russia just got their mole.
Katana1369,The backroom deal Kevin said he did not make.
Kahzgul,Can Biden just refuse to grant her the security clearance she needs to be on the committee?
wearetheleftovers,"She made a deal with McCarthy for her speaker vote. So, why does she want THIS position so badly?"
30mil,We should all feel safe from Jewish Space Lasers now.
Motor_Somewhere7565,A terrorist on the Homeland Security Committee? Sounds about right for Republicans
punditguy,"Oh, it's completely believable."
ImAllAboutYou,15 votes has got to buy something!
mangoserpent,So. The GOP strategy is to be purposefully incompetent then run in 2024 on government is stupid so let's get rid of it?
er1026,"This is absolutely disgusting, immoral, tone deaf and infuriating. McCarthy is almost as big of a scum bag as Trump. Almost."
Ryan_Jonathan_Martin,"Sorry Americans, but putting a Russian asset on the HSC doesn't seem like the best choice eh? ü§î"
GivingRedditAChance,GOP is a plague
theheadofkhartoum627,This is going to end badly. For everyone.
new-6reddit9,‚ÄúEnemies Foreign and Domestic‚Äù - this failure will be on you who voted for Republican in the midterm!
TheAtomicRatonga,Could Biden just revoke her security clearance so she cannot be put on any commitee that requires one?
liililllllliilillill,"The people who supported a violent insurrection against the US get to just keep being politicians. 

Everyone who votes R hates the United States and wants to burn it and start over. Don‚Äôt let them forget it."
Character-Error5426,"Before taking office, Greene had claimed on social media that deadly school shootings were staged, liked posts calling for the execution of Democratic leaders and federal agents, and supported the baseless theory that space lasers owned by a Jewish cabal had caused one of California‚Äôs deadliest wildfires."
chrisnavillus,"What a sick joke this country has become. A domestic terrorist on Homeland Security Committee. Honestly, how stupid do they think we are?"
abacusartifact,"She was put on the committee for the sole purpose of destroying herself.   None of the other Republicans had the balls to deal with her, so this was the simplest option.  Give it a few months and a unanimous decision will be made to throw the crazy woman to the kerb."
thefanciestcat,"Republicans have no ideas.  They are the ""do whatever Democrats don't like"" party, and unfortunately for everyone, that includes having someone who cheered for an insurrection that, if successful, would have ended free elections in the United States of America and led to the murders of many members of Congress on the Homeland Security Committee."
YeomenWarder,"MTG should not be anywhere near public service.

Do those who have voted for her check on what she does on gov't besides divide and sling around autocratic nonsense?"
theindependentonline,"Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is set to join the House Homeland Security committee in a decision that is drawing disbelief and disgust from her critics who find themselves unable to fathom that a onetime 9/11 truther and spreader of countless conspiracies will now sit on a committee making decisions about America‚Äôs defence.

AtticaBlue,"We‚Äôre finally going to find out about the Jewish space lasers, guys!"
himynameisky,Why do I even follow the laws anymore? It's only for us common people I guess.
ChefILove,Can she find her home state on an unlabeled map?
21kondav,Republicans: *realizing they have representatives in major committees and control the house* WE‚ÄôRE BEING OPPRESSED
readparse,"What do you mean ""disbelief?""  How can anybody be shocked at anything anymore?  There is no bottom, people.

Don't be shocked when you find out who George Santos really is, and who is really benefitting.

Don't be shocked when you find out Donald Trump, or anybody in his circle, lied about something.

Don't be shocked when a MAGA extremist commits and act of violence or terror.

Don't be shocked when some Christian Fundamentalist says something hateful on television or the internet.

Don't be shocked when some gun nut takes an AR-15 to another school and kills another dozen or so kids, and probably a teacher or two.  And don't be shocked when all the other gun nuts say ""An AR-15 is just another rifle, like any other rifle,"" and yet for some reason that's the gun that has so much demand that it's hard to keep on store shelves.

Don't be shocked when Trump wins the GOP nomination, and don't be shocked when he wins the next election, if both Democrats and _democrats_ don't come out in droves to prevent that from happening.

And don't be shocked when white supremacists do everything they can to use the _Shelby County v. Holder_ decision to prevent the ""wrong people"" from voting."
JohnnyGFX,"I struggle to find things about the GOP that I can even respect. I don't have to agree with something to respect it to some degree or another, but the modern GOP is just clown shoes."
Ok-Ease7090,Let‚Äôs put traitors in charge of our defense. What could go wrong?
slightlyused,It is so she can sell the info.
mdavis360,Beyond sickening.  I don‚Äôt want to live in interesting times any more.
MonkeyWrench1973,"Russia didn't just get a front row seat, they got the reins."
Frequent_Owl_2923,"This once again shows that two-party systems are completely out of time. This is only the beginning of much worse to come. It doesn't even matter whether Trump gets reelected or not. The GOP is completely lost anyway. And when one of two parties in a two-party system has completely lost its mind, you're basically lost as a country. You can't win anymore when that happens. You can only lose, more and more and more, every day.

If anyone thinks things will get better, you're naive. Things will not get better until the two-party system ceases to exist in the US."
Ill-Meeting7644,"Racist, anti-semetic, 9/11 truther, QAnon believing, Russian plant has access to classified information

Nice job USA üá∫üá∏"
AbsentGlare,"I can kind of understand, you know, hiring an agent from the last coup to prevent the next one, the way you can hire hackers to secure computer systems.

But the coup she was a part of was such a miserable failure, the traitors almost credibly pretend it wasn‚Äôt a coup at all."
J_ablo,Hopefully MTG will be able to requisition some of those Jewish space lasers and use them to defend the borders /s
cervidaetech,The GOP is sabotaging America on behalf of Russia and noone is doing anything to stop them
OliverClothesov87,This country is a fucking joke
R_W0bz,Russia got their in.
homebaked,"Well,now we know what McCarthy gave up for her vote."
justforthearticles20,"Their intent is to destroy the Government in the next 2 years. The ones that don't answer to Putin, answer to Charles Koch, and he has been working to end the Republic his entire adult life."
Snoo6435,B should not have a security sclearance. She gonna fuck things up. I've got my popcorn and cokes ready for this shit show.
Orwick,"McCarthy is clearly worried about Jewish space lasers, so he put an expert in that field on the homeland security committee.

Otherwise the would be danger of largest welfare recipient attacking us."
RDO_Desmond,That's pretty crazy.
Extension_Car_8594,Disbelief? Surely we are well past that.
knomore-llama_horse,What a fucking joke.
Tony_Stark_0,No good will come of this.
definitely_a_human01,"This is the person who didn‚Äôt believe 9/11 was real, right?  Yeah, this sounds like a good idea."
sonic10158,"It must be so easy to live life as a republican, having zero consequences for anything"
WWGFD,She is 100% Selling secrets
Evening_Chemist_2367,She probably asked for Homeland Security Committee so that she could warn her insurrectionist friends when they pop up on DHS's radar and squash the investigations.
SemichiSam,"I can understand the anger, but I call bullshit on the disbelief. No rational person ever expected the Republican party to do anything but shit on the House of Representatives once they got the power to do so. They will not simply accomplish nothing, they are already planning to accomplish nothing. MTG would destroy the entire government if she actually had any power, but she and all the other crazies in the party were allowed in just for their ability to create chaos that Republican leaders can renounce whenever it suits them, or encourage when that suits them. Don't look at these distractions. Watch what the party does."
rainbirdstew,why disbelief ? these people are fucking clowns
Randumb4Ever,MTG is a literal security threat for her insurrectionists views and lack of critical thinking skills to figure out popular conspiracies are fake. Now she oversees our nation‚Äôs security??? WTF!
BobLampostl,Look at those exposed arms. No way she would be allowed in the Missouri legislature in that outfit.
darklightsun,Why hasn't she been arrested for placing those pipe bombs on January 6th?  Watch the video of the person that placed them and tell me that it isn't her.  She has a very distinctive troll like shuffle that is identical to the person in the video.
Past_Wind_9725,Disbelief? ü§£ Shitbags gonna Shitbag.
dontreallycareforit,"Don‚Äôt let these pointless distractions that are sure to come work, people.

She‚Äôs going to generate a near endless stream of bullshit with that position and it‚Äôll be destructive, or at least a block to progress, at the least, but also it‚Äôll be an effective smokescreen. This woman generates a ton of rage media for left-leaning people and it‚Äôs all to easy to get sucked into it on social media. Don‚Äôt give in to the massive outage machine."
mala27369,Just send the briefings directly to Putin
Luda87,Should make her do polygraph and she if she pass it
jupiterkansas,My congressman is on that committee (Cleaver). I feel so sorry for him having to put up with her trying to suck all the oxygen out of the room.
mckenro,Biden should eliminate the DHS.
GrouchyBadger65,"As a New Yorker, that lost a few friends 9/11. Fuck her!!!"
btbam666,Imagine how fucked up the country would be a fucking Trump won.
AvaruusX,"How is this even possible, she seems to get higher and higher every year even tho she's bat shit crazy nazi?"
hollycoolio,Why are we in the worst timeline?
rufftranslation,"The anger I understand, but disbelief..? Do you even America?"
TastyWheat0r,"Uh, you guys speed speedrunning Idiocracy over there or something else?"
VanceKelley,"Less than 2 years after the attempted coup, Americans had a chance to express their outrage at the voting booth.

Americans handed control of the House to the coup supporters.

This is what you get when you combine garbage voters with a garbage electoral system."
penguished,"Anger now? Should have sent her to jail the week it happened.

If there aren't consequences, what do you fucking expect?"
sausage_ditka_bulls,History books 100 years from now will equate the American republic to the Weimar Republic
Explodedhamster, Until Republican voters face real and hurtful consequences for their voting they're simply not going to change all they look for is the letter R.
jrgman42,"Well, the insurrection-3 and their orange leader should already be in jail, so this isn‚Äôt surprising.  They‚Äôve already stop requiring the traitors to pass through the metal detector, so‚Ä¶"
ProDiesel,I‚Äôm so tired of obvious corruption. People raided the Capitol for trump‚Ä¶. But ignore blatant corruption caused by his antics.
Demonking3343," 

So we seriously put the women who claimed the democrats used Jewish space lasers to win the election, in the homeland security committee‚Ä¶..welll shit."
1313pd1313,"When you put a certified moron in charge of security, aren't you doing it to commit a crime and ensure you get away with it?"
pedanticast,I think this is the point where we give up on not wishing for death to these truly awful people.
bazzbj,Security? On what qualifications exactly‚Ä¶
Navyguy73,"Get ready for the worst 2 years in air travel. And you can bet all the 'Never Kevins' were only there to get her this seat to protect Trump.

""DHS is responsible for counterterrorism, cybersecurity, ***aviation security***, border security, port security, maritime security, administration and enforcement of our immigration laws, protection of our national leaders, protection of critical infrastructure, cybersecurity...s ""

""HSI criminal investigators, also referred to as special agents, conduct criminal and civil investigations involving ***national security threats***, terrorism, drug smuggling, child exploitation, human trafficking, illegal arms export, ***financial crimes***, identity fraud, benefit fraud, commercial fraud and more."""
CaptainSur,"This is pure spite and vindictiveness by the Republican Party.  Next to Trump and his inner circle, she is in the next tier of American traitors, and belongs in jail not in Congress.  A bought and paid for Russian mole.  Her sole goal is to destroy American democracy."
Lamplord72,Fox News has done more damage to this country than Communism ever has.
clkou,Blame the nearly 40 to 50 percent of the Americans public who is too stupid to vote for the most qualified candidate as in NOT MTG.
Billybigduck,"Putting insane people in charge of important crap.

That's the American way."
CaesarsNads,"The anger i get. Disbelief though? I expect nothing less. Next up, Gaetz on an anti-sex trafficking committee."
cantiskipthisstep12,Ahh the Russian asset getting access to top secret US documents. What could possibly go wrong?
mavjustdoingaflyby,Holup. An insurrectionist sympathizer was put on a Homeland Security Committee?
the_reifier,What's there to disbelieve? Republicans still love Jan 6th. They loved Trump. They're the same shitty fascists as ever. Whoever didn't realize something like this was coming really isn't good at thinking or at learning.
seamustheseagull,"Seems like a very ill-judged idea to allow a conspiracy theorist and anti-government activist to have access to sensitive/classified security information.

And then you'll have domestic terrorism deliberately exploiting security weaknesses or names of assets being leaked online and Republicans will be like, ""How could the White House have let this  happen?!"""
Happybara,She just keeps failing up‚Ä¶ what even is the republican party anymore?
Hawntir,"WE PUT A TERRORIST ON THE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE?

Jesus Christ. We are fucked."
biskitheadburl,Allowing our nation to be controlled by traitors is not a good idea.
Tristain7,"Remember folks, the entire point is to break the government... to demonstrate that it's corrupt by corrupting it.  The GOP is an existential threat to America by choice, and the rest of us need to figure out what we're going to do about it before it's too late."
teebalicious,"The GOP is all about performative morality with zero integrity. 

They have built this titanic strawman out of their ‚Äúenemies‚Äù so that literally any move is justified as a preemptive strike. 

Not to be histrionic, but this is a ‚Äútip of the spear for death camps‚Äù move. And the Republicans who just want to get richer and more powerful will gladly feed us to the murder fetishist culture warriors to get what they want. 

Performative morality with zero integrity. Absolutely craven."
drpacz,Her first act: codify the Gespacho Police.
BuffaloBillCraplism,"Wait until (us) Liberals find out who the chair of the armed services committee is.

Soon Matt GaYtzz will be able to receive plane fulls of underage girls: overnight shipped direct from the Kremlin."
WarLizurd,Domestic terrorist Marjorie Taylor Greene?
Northern_Grouse,"If they can‚Äôt sabotage without, they‚Äôll sabotage within. Motherfuckers are destroying this country so they can cheat taxes, and get richer off the backs of the everyday person. 

We‚Äôre footing almost the entire bill for keeping this ‚Äúgreatest nation on Earth‚Äù running; and what do we get for it?  More wars. No healthcare. No childcare. Roads are shit. Water is shit. Power grid is shit. Land management is shit. Educating the population is shit. 

Every single aspect of what makes a first world country a first world country is completely shit because these sick motherfuckers can‚Äôt stop their unquenchable thirst for more more more, over the bodies of everyone else. 

Man alive I can‚Äôt wait for the climate shit to truly start hitting the fan when the most vulnerable start to die off because of floods, fires, freezes, or straight up hunger.  

Keep it up assholes. You will reap what you sow, and the meek will inherit the Earth."
ChuckoRuckus,Welp‚Ä¶  We know of at least one of the back room deals McCarthy made to become Speaker
redwing180,Seems like the perfect place for the GOP to put a Russian troll.
DontWeAvoidPlauges,"Yeah this sent me‚Ä¶ like what the actual fuck. Homeland was founded to ya know‚Ä¶ protect the homeland from terrorism post 9/11 (now we can debate the success of that endeavor and it‚Äôs inconsistencies another time). To put an actual domestic terrorist onto this committee is one big fuck you to not just the ‚Äúlibs‚Äù the ‚Äúcommies‚Äù the ‚Äúradical left‚Äù or whatever other catchword, but to any decent American who believes in free and fair elections and democratic norms"
