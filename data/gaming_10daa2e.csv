_Nova_Corps,I just remember it being one of the first games that actually looks better than it’s E3 Demo
gurugulab6969,Difference between passion and job.
OnyxBee,"I felt like this wasn't a good comparison of pics at all,    One is raining which is notorious for wetter=better graphics illusion.

That being said,  I've not played the new one so idk what it's like."
Joe_F82,Night time plus rain is always gonna look better
PogoConspiracy,"Been playing Gotham Knights a lot, and the right picture is definitely a biased, cherry picked photo to make it look boring.

Also, I'm not saying Gotham Knights isn't without issues, but did everyone forget the absolute dumpster fire that Arkham Knight was on release? They even pulled it off of store shelves a few weeks after it released.

I don't think there's a perfect game out there that will please everyone, but from playing both of these titles at launch, I don't care how good the game looks if I can't play it, and I've gotten WAY less crashes on GK than I ever did playing AK. They're both fun though, I dunno why GK is getting so much hate."
AbLincoln1863,I mean I can see the difference but I’m not sure if leagues worse is accurate. Definitely shocking that a 7 year old game can look as good or better than a modern game but I feel everyone is over dramatic about the graphics in Gotham Knight because it is a bad game and people wanna hate it more
dlittlefair1,"Your whole post history is full of you trying to spark outrage that games are getting worse graphics than they did in the past by comparing apples to lemons, I really don’t know what you’re trying to achieve but it’s pathetic."
amitym,I see this as an interesting example of the difference that good art design makes.
Synner1985,How many times are you going to whinge about this?
Dogstile,"Different game. Different studios. Different workers. Different budgets. Different constraints.

Game developers aren't 1 to 1 clones of eachother."
XDenzelMoshingtonX,"Why is OP posting shitty visual comparisons 24/7?

How about you play games instead of obsessing over how game x looks better/worse than game y?"
ReDeR_TV,"Ah the old gta v rain trick to make all the graphics mods look ""realistic"". Turn off the rain in arkham and I doubt it will look as good as the new game"
WolfPaw_90,Almost as amazing as how many sheep have reposted this begging for attention...
SimplySatisfyin,I mean isn’t this comparing apples to oranges. A better comparison would be with suicide squad since they also worked on the Arkham series no?
StupidestGuyNominee,"Your obsession with graphics is unhinged, bud"
,[removed]
IntertelRed,Gorham knights was a horrible experience but can we please understand what an art style is. The art isn't the part of the game to criticize.
iSoReddit,Both look the same to me
Ennis_1,"I recall Arkham Knight being notable buggy at launch, but I believe/assume it's still more subsutantial than Gotham Knights."
DArtTheEmcee,"I mean I always felt Gotham Knights is clearly a bigger game, it has a completely different kind of focus.  I've played the Arkham Games and I'm enjoying Gotham Knights every bit as much as the Arkham series.  I like the traversal better, the radiant crimes keep me engaged with incentives, the suits and weapon builds are plentiful too and Gotham is interesting to explore.  You get to see the Ice Berg Lounge, Stagg Industries, Fox Techa, Black Gate, Start Labs and many other cool landmarks!  The Bat cycle actually fits on the road, and looks like it can ride with other vehicles on the same road.  

The combat has its own style, either you love it or you don't.  However the grappling system sucks, sometimes it's limits you to random indicators of where you can grapple to.  For instance I may want a building across the street, but for some reason the indicator will only let me grapple to the lamp post to the the right of me wtf?🤬  The game is heavily frame based, which means every frame must be completed.  It's a aesthetic in a sense, but it makes it tough to acutely control the characters.  

Whatever they do they must finish, even when being attacked and they take damage.🤬 They took an approach with Red Hood that I initially didn't like, but it eventually grew on me. He's one of the most fun to play with the guns, and with the way the combat system works He's the best experience for it.  The camera is a huge problem in this game, it can cause so many things to go wrong.  The frame rate issue affects where they stand to, You must stand in the right place in order to get a command prompt for something. If you're in the sweet spot and move even a inch and the command prompt disappear, hitting the wrong button could change your stealth situation into an open brawl.🤬

Don't get me wrong The game certainly is flawed, but so were the Arkham games.  However I definitely feel the difference in the open world, I Love the fact that they are deep trenches within Gotham. Small lower income areas, that really look downtrodden. Also playing the game, the graphics don't look that bad to me. However these are all my opinions, I can understand if nobody else shares them 🫡👑"
JayJ_20,Sick of these posts of people who never played the game complaining about Gotham Knights. Aside from it's technical issues it's a very solid game.. 20-30 hours of superhero enjoyment. It's like if the avengers game actually wasn't a soulless cash grab. People just were upset they didn't get their Arkham Knight 2. Comparison can be the thief of joy with the gaming community it seems.
R3plica83,Bro ur about half a year late on this one lmao
TB-252,"Dude, this was 3 months ago. Move on"
Spicy-hot_Ramen,Ikr such a disappointment in every regard but at least Batgirl has a fine booty
Gedaru,I actually think Gotham Knights looks great. At least on PS5
dropbear_hunter,"It's not insane at all when you consider the effort and passion that one is overflowing with, and the other is truly devoid of."
alietrie,"I hate this take, it's posted here for like what a 100th time? These are different games made by different studios w different people working there and w different ideas in mind.
How dumb is it to compare these games w implication that GK is shit bc its graphics is (surprise) different. Go compare AK to lego batman while you're at it.

GK has its flaws but it's a fun game and it still looks good even wo hyper realistic scenery overflowing w effects that no hardware could run on release (no offence to AK, I love it as well)."
Orcasubmarine,"It's actully not, because your obsession with graphics is part of the reason why we ended up here in the first place."
krombeaupolis,This shit again
darknyteorange,Graphics and art direction are two separate things. The Arkham series has fantastic art direction.
killerstarxc,"How many more times are you gonna post random, skewed and meaningless graphics comparisons op?"
OldMan1901,The graphics stood out drastically in 2015. It's like Crysis
pikkis-95,So this gets reposted here every two weeks now?
OneeGrimm,"Isn't that, like, whole different game company?"
Castor_volk,"no, what's actual insane is how often this shit get reposted like you've solved the enigma machine of ""two different teams can have two different levels of quality. """
homerino7Z,"I see no difference, one is raining, one is not"
Scum_Of_TheEarth,"one on the right looks better than the one on the left.. what are you going on about.. blurry trash on the left.. clear on the right.. = improvement. just look at the detail in the road alone.. seriously.. good lord people... either way, both games are dreadfully boring.."
Vaizel,I'd like to remind people that on release Arkham Knight ran like absolute garbage. No point in comparing screenshots if the game experience is still shit
zenithzinger,"Not defending Gotham but 1 has untethered coop and one does not,

This is objectively an unfair comparison.


Also Arkam Knight released as a mess on launch for the PC as well so not sure why we’re singing it’s praise."
,"ah yes, Arkham Knight, with it's entire 4fps it produced in the rain or while driving, how fun it was..."
TheRedEyedSamurai,Unoriginal ass post. Arkham Knight looks better than most modern games
diuturnal,You obviously never played that 2015 piece of shit. Game literally would not run on anyones computer.
KorvicSpartan,Try being a Pokémon fan
Coldspark824,One just has a rain filter
seefith,Is it really that bad? I was thinking about picking it up.
evo_one252,Wait until you see Pokémon and Zelda games lol Imagine if we held Nintendo to this standard
_Aj_,The original was one of the games that actually used PhysX right?
protomagik,I bought my laptop in 2016 for 800$. Modern new ones for the same price have exact same specs if not worse. The last 7-8 years were kinda slow in tech
DV-dv,"I feel like after covid game and movie studio took a massive nosedive and lost their momentum. 

I haven’t bought a new game or went out to the cinema for a long while. Everything just seems mediocre. Elden Ring is the only game that I was excited to play."
Metool42,Literally just lighting. The graphics themselves speak differently.
CobaltShadow3,"I was reading about those potential Suicide Squad : Kill The Justice League  leaks and one of them had the bullet point that the game was supposed to be  a G.A.A.S. but Avengers did so poorly that they scrapped all that and transitioned into a more traditional game. Gotham Knights screams ""This was supposed ro be a live service game"" . Everything from the UI to the damage spongey enemies. This game was conceived as live service and everyone got scared after Avengers shit the bed."
Dr_Edge_ATX,Video games are like the new architecture. Houses and buildings built a hundred years ago hold up and look better than new things built last week.
Peter_G,"Why is it insane?

Let me explain this, video game graphics... they stopped getting better around 2010.  A little after really but in that general region.  It's not that there's not slightly higher fidelity, more objects, more detailed textures, it's that you're not noticing any of that shit as you bounce around punching ninjas and thugs.  All they need to do is make what they are building actually look good, and your mind is going to fill in the little details, just like people who keep posting how they remember those old pixel art graphics looking way better than they did.  It's because the blurring of CRT mixed with the way human brains perceive and remember things made it look way better than it actually was.  

More polys, better texture resolution, more detailed shadows, they aren't REALLY improving things adding a tiny bit of resolution only the real graphics enthusiasts are going to pay attention to, and graphics are so good that's an increasingly tiny subsection of gamers.  So when you point out this game, half a decade later, looks like ass... it's because amateurs who took a lazy route didn't spend enough time and effort redesigning, or maybe are just fucking ass creators who don't know what's ""good"", but regardless it's because production failed to care enough to produce a coherent idea of their product, which is batman swinging around and beating people up on a dark stormy night.  

The problem here is either greed, ineptitude, or laziness, and it's predictable as fuck."
Cinemaslap1,"I actually disagree. The Arkham Knight game was almost all the same color. Add in the rain and it muddied everything, it all blending together. Gotham Knights, it's just as ""crisp"", the color variation is at least more realistic (not just blacks and grays with the occasional red).

But it is also worth noting that these games were going for different ""feels"" when it came to gameplay and the world.... So this is much like comparing apples and oranges."
casualrocket,"Bad bot,

GK looks really good, it def looks better than arkham"
samthemanborg,"Lol this is such a cherry picked image of a boring street, the map is gigantic and has amazing views and niche little areas. Arkham Knight of course looks spectacular both for its time and today, doesn’t mean GK is a pile of garbage like some seem to be pushing."
ScritchesMcMewington,But at least it runs at sub 30fps so that's something I guess
Chokl8Th1der,"Improve the graphics and frame rate all you want, it wouldn't make Gotham knights good. The game sucks across the board."
IdRatherBeAtChilis,Arkham Knight also controls leagues better and smoother too.
Onjaki-Toheti,Are game developers even trying these days?
mooseheadstudios,Its as if the devs matter more then the tools... go figure. its okay tho people learn and grow as well.
Richiieee,"The White Knight defenders are more insane. Yeah, Gotham is a dark, grim place, but unless you don't have eyes, the Arkham games still does Gotham better."
ehazkul,The killzone games blew me away with how great they looked at the time as well.
MajorBoogimos,Not the people defending Gotham knights. You wasted money. Get over it. Not only does it look like shit but the world is empty and lifeless.
vocalviolence,The Jurassic Park (1993) Effect.
XColdLogicX,The Arkham series was a masterclass in art design and graphic fidelity.
HulkingGizmo,Jesus how did this get 13k up votes? Did everybody suddenly become visually impaired?
mycinematiccorner,Y'all realize the difference is rain right? GK has its own cool neon take on Gotham. Also the graphics are great. People are just butt hurt we don't have another Arkham game lmao
CmdrKuretes,"I literally couldn’t play Knights. I went back and played Arkham Knight again in prep for Knigjts, which was a big mistake."
xseodz,"Just gonna always say it, I don't think things are harder or whatever these days.

Game development projects are so mismanaged. They also seem to be completely bankrupt of passion and talent, mostly because teh only people left are those that just do it for a job, and the relevant MBAs that extract money.

Anyone worth their salt is doing indie projects actually making good shit."
punchingtigers19,"And it took like 25 steps back in combat, in Arkham night the combat was so fluid and smooth and brutal! I loves fighting in that game"
kaden-99,Comparing the graphical fidelity of two games using a highly compressed 720p image is not a good idea.
TURRETCUBE,7.....? shit am i that old?
SomeKindofTreeWizard,"Why do third person games INSIST on orienting the character to camera-left, and take up almost half the damn screen?"
EKcore,Slap some RTX on there. All done.
EdgarsChainsaw,Not insane. Just shows that hardware is no longer the limiting factor in graphics; human design labor is.
RaymondMasseyXbox,How does multi-player effect game development?  I always assumed a lot as I'm still waiting for factions to release for over 2 years despite the early leaks.
paul-d9,"It's a character study on what is lost when you devote so many resources to making a live service game only to back peddle and release it as a regular game. 

How they didn't look at Marvel's Avengers and the backlash and disdain and think ""hmm let's go in a different direction"" is beyond me.

I mean say what you want about Assassins Creed and its microtransactions but at least those games are finished (most of them at least)"
Dsamf2,Ya wtf happened
spider-dan2077,"I think Arkham Knight was great looking, but the rain also helps mask details a bit. I would still agree though"
DangerousCyclone,"What’s funny is that it’s not that Gotham Knights looks bad, in fact it looks pretty decent for a video game, it’s just that Arkham Knight just looks so much better. If Arkham Knight didn’t exist I feel like people would be more blown away by Gotham Knights, but AK just set the bar really high.

There are so many games out there that look legitimately bad for being a AAA game like the new Pokémon or the new Saints Row."
Vandosz,Technology doesnt always look better if the artists didnt have the time to make it look a certain way. Technologically the 2015 game is far less advanced. It just has better art direction and more time spent.
jl_theprofessor,"I just remember Gordon and Batman having a conversation and thinking to myself ""That looks like real rain soaking their clothes."" 

I'm not sure regarding the up close fidelity of the graphics but I know from what I've seen that Arkham Knight has much better art direction."
xxDoublezeroxx,"People who’ve never developed a game in their life don’t understand how technically difficult it is to produce a game like Gotham Knights where you have Unlinked Drop-in, Drop-out co-op (Which is impressive by itself), versus a singe player game. There are so many more factors that go into making a multiplayer game with the technical level of Gotham Knights."
Enelro,"all new triple A games are going the unfinished, under-developed, unoptimized route, and releasing early for free mass 'beta-testing' and ya'll are falling for it with your wallets."
hu94,"It doesn’t even look any worse. The one on the left just has the rain effect plus a better bit of scenery.

Also - most games from 2015 looked very realistic with great graphics. We can’t act like the gaming industry is going to be continuously improving their graphics significantly when there isn’t a ton of room for improvement."
LurkingLarry43,It’s even more insane that this circlejerk is still going. Are pixel points really that important to you?
General_Snack,Propaganda post
MatoranArmory,It’s actually insane y’all consider two cherry-picked screen shots to be actual worthwhile sources.
Newone1255,This fucking guy again
PM_ME_GOODDOGS,I guess I’ll finally unsubscribe from this shitty sub. Nth time this kinda stupid thing is posted.
MysteryPlaid,"Not every game has to be a photo realistic, emotional journey. Some games are just fun, with entertaining writing, fully realized characters, and gameplay that makes it ------- wait, wait what's that? Gotham Knights has none of those things?? Oh fuck well nevermind"
MarkusRight,"Does it seem like games nowadays arent made with any passion anymore?, Every game now seems to be made for maximizing as much profit as it possibly can and using psychology to manipulate the player into buying the extra microtransactions and loot boxes. What a horrible future games are headed down. At least I got to grow up in the golden era of gaming during the 90's when games were complete upon release and could be played offline and never once asked you to buy the cosmetics or modes that we could unlock by just playing the game, back then we got to unlock that stuff by actually being good at the game, you kill a hard boss you get rewarded with some new badass cosmetics that make the next playthrough worth it. Now you dont get that same rewarded feeling. Maybe thats why I have almost entirely shifted to playing Indie games more than 90% of the time in the past 5 years."
Rodger_as_Jack_Smith,"Love me a cherry picked screen shot. 

Classic reddit gaming."
Mr_ACGamble,"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a cash cow."
Hatjin,Most sad thing is that GK is just boring. I played like an hour and have 0 fun. Like I played free to play mobile game that's trying to look like console game but you feel that sole purpose of this game is to bore you till you give dev your money.
shortybobert,Rain?
b4c0n333,I think you're comparing apples to oranges here. Is there a part in Arkham Knight when it doesn't rain? That will be a better comparison
TryingAgainWhyNot,"Which one is being suggested looks better? Hard to tell bc one has rain and the other doesn’t, but the one on the right looks better/newer to me (as a non-gamer)."
ProtectionDecent,"It's funny how that works, isn't it? It's almost as if developer slave camps, I mean, big publishers can't be arsed anymore about even trying to deliver something that's actually good these days."
justapileofshirts,"Am I the only one who thinks the second picture is fine?
Why is the first one raining, but the second one isnt? It also looks cluttered, which may be a specific design choice but I can't tell what I'm looking at.

I have heard that Knights has bad graphics, but a single still of a streetside that looks okay isn't really telling me anything."
MaesterLazer,Design > Resolution
EsdrasCaleb,we evolved at this point graphics is a combination of tecnlogy+artistic sense and not just tecnology
ajerxs,"I understand that this looks crazy from a glance, but from what I’ve heard there is a lot of trickery going on to make that game look like it does. Also what other people have said about the rain generally giving it a false sense of enhancement."
opp0rtunist,We’ve come to a point where hardware improvements don’t really impact the look of a game. Effort and time put in by developers does.
Brendissimo,I'll let you in on a little secret - graphics tech has barely advanced at all in the last 10+ years. It's almost completely stagnant.
NeroXOTWOD,"Knights was such a horrible game. I bought it on sale, and still I felt robbed"
dratelectasis,"I keep seeing all these new games being released and they're all very ""cartoonish"" as you can see here. We have these powerful systems with pretty lackluster games."
SnoopDeLaRoup,Gothort Knights
GreatBayTemple,"Brand new games have brand new development teams. Some are more experienced than others, it doesn't matter if it's the same studio if it's cost effective to simply hire new blood to make a new game."
Edwardc4gg,The Batman games will forever be one of the best trilogy of games.  My god was it great!!!
LoSouLibra,"You guys all whined about the Batmobile and not being able to run mega ultra hyper max settings on a potato PC, so they stopped wasting money on making good games."
RBlomax38,Gotham knights had issues but overall I thought it looked better than a lot of other games out right now. Arkham Knight was just amazing
Jedi_Gill,"Just because they share the Batman name doesn't mean anything, the clear difference is simply on the developer that worked on each game.

Batman: Arkham City is a 2011 action-adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.

Gotham Knights is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by WB Games Montréal and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.

I think it's quite clear by these pictures and the gameplay that the developer makes all the difference and Rocksteady has been known to make some really amazing games that hold the test of time."
elysiansaurus,"I don't know which is which but I would guess Gotham knights came out in 2022, that road looks crisp."
dReDone,Really picked the worst images to compare.
GenericNerdGirl,"But but, in that left one you only had 60 frames instead of 120, and could sometimes see pixels instead of 4K HD on every single texture and effect no matter how insignificant! Therefore we had to improve on that! Also rain is haaaard :c 

/s"
Cless_Aurion,Art direction is one hell of a drug.
KitteNlx,DCUO's Gotham looks as good as Knights does.
afewpast,That was back when companies gave a shit about the games they were selling
numbarm72,"It's heavily raining on the left and pointing at some rather nice set of lights an imagery, next one is clear night and polluted air looking at a side street, let's be honest this is fox media type comparison, if you wanted to be legit, you would have it be a stormy night facing the same place, that would be a proper comparison, however I have not played either of these games, one looks like it has batman, the other, doesn't, I know wich one I'd play anyway"
MrDarkboy2010,"to be fair, Arkham Knight was graphically way ahead of it's time. ((to the detriment of performance))"
heilspawn,That's what happens when you take Batman out of a Batman game
warrentyvoided,Not enough comments about how these are made by different developers... one top notch and the other mid at best
Acalson,Tbf… Arkham Knight looks better than most games that released in 2022
DEFTMAC22,This is why a good art direction is the way to go. always looks better than games that go for the cold lifeless “realistic” look.
utopianlasercat,"It actually does not look worse. It’s just a different graphic style. GK is set in an 1980’s inspired neon soaked Gotham, and Arkham Knight is in an Tim Burton style Gotham. (Which yes is also 80’s)."
OffMyChestATM,So... you're a karma farmer?
perilousrob,"It **really** doesn't look worse. Gotham Knights is a pretty great looking game.

[For example](https://imgur.com/CZI2s54), and [another](https://imgur.com/0zPSvyE).

and that's just with the settings that I use to actually play the game. \~90fps, 1440p. RTX is not enabled."
lpjunior999,"If Gotham Knights doesn’t suddenly become lousy with tanks, I’ll take it."
Treshcore,"Unpopular opinion: I think that Gotham Knights looks very well.

I haven't played the game yet, but I wish to when I have a better PC. I looked on it and I can't see any reason why it doesn't look amazing. As far as I understand, Batman: Arkham shows a very gothic Gotham while Gotham Knights tries to show it as more... typical American city, yet quite gritty. When I saw it in [one of the How Big Is The Map videos](https://youtu.be/_-x_4CrskAc), my first association was clear: Liberty City from Grand Theft Auto IV, and I think it's a good sign. Visual effects may be poorer than in Batman: Arkham Knight, but personally I think that the less effects, the better.

I think that people have chosen this game as a scapegoat of 2022. I understand why they hate Saints Row reboot. However, I see nothing wrong with Gotham Knights so far."
DelgadoTheRaat,I don't think raytracing looks that much better.  Especially for the performance reduction
Amara_Rey,It's actually insane that these are two completely different games with two completely different art styles.
A_Hideous_Beast,"Gamers doing that thing again, where they confuse different art styles with quality, and forgetting the myriad of issues Arkham Knight had on release, and how much people disliked that game. 

Now people are all defending Arkham Knight. I swear Gamers have really bad memories."
Leedleheed,"Actually it doesn't. If you play both Gotham knights blows it out of the water, texture wise, graphic wise, combat wise. Instead of comparing a single screenshot actually play the game."
Apokolypze,2022 does have a far cooler logo though.
kimmycolden,your fault for buying shitty games
Phatz907,"Gotham knights looks really good at high settings. The problem is that it’s pretty unstable. When it runs well, it’s beautiful. 

I haven’t played Arkham knight in a while so I can’t compare the two but… I wouldn’t say it looks “leagues worse”"
Andrew1990M,"Charitably, you could argue that Gotham Knights is designed to be an online co-op game so you have to reduce fidelity. 

Problem is apparently the world isn’t contiguous when running online, am I right about that?"
charlesbronZon,"And it runs like shit while looking worse too!

That level of fuck up almost sounds hard to achieve, like they had a bonus depend on it and they worked hard to make it happen 😂"
TheDirectTV,Ur TRIPPIN😂
fuzzmeisterj,"GK looks fine if you played it at all.  AK has better art direction, but the ""graphics"" are hidden by rain and a small low quality image."
Bowling_pins_10,Look about the same to me
SnakebiteSnake,7 years is a long time to find ways to cut costs
VoodooStone,"It’s not worse, it’s different. Gotham Knights also has a lot more going on in it then Arkham Knight could even begin to process."
Rat_faced_knacker,Gamers learning about art direction for the first time.
m0rl0ck1996,A little bloom can hide a multitude of sins.
CutMeLoose79,"I've played Gotham Knights at 4K 60fps on ultra settings with ray tracing on. It's actually quite a nice looking game and people cherry pick their photos for comparisons to make it look a lot worse than it is.

You've picked the most boring, suburban street without all the nice neon signs scattered throughout the game for starters. Also while it isn't raining and not showing off any of the really nice RT reflections or the good fog effects filled with the lights of the neon signs.

The Gotham Knights / Arkham Knight comparisons are generally shown in bad faith, just like this one.

I'm not saying the overall art style and world structure of Arkham Knight isn't better looking, but this is a badly made comparison."
Ghost-of-farta,"Yeah I guess ""gAmInG iS mOvInG BaCkWaRdS"" 🙄"

This shit is happening a lot lately. Game Devs don't play games anymore 🤷‍♂️ 😂"
etcumtyrannide86,"One is an online game, and the other is a single-player game
 Due to latency and communication between computers, it's a better running game if it isn't filled with graphical clutter."
HerakIinos,Battlefield 1 was released way back in 2016 and still looks better than any shooter released since then.
BadSaltLundgren,I think a lot of AAA developers are kinda falling down the uncanny valley of videogames
