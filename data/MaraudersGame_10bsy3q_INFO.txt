{"Title": "To whoever helped us in asteroid mine last night, thanks for making my first day with the game memorable", "Post Text": "We were the duo wearing yellow raider suits who just spawned in our airlock and started spamming F8. It was so much fun running around and clearing the mine, up until then I had just been ratting. I wasn\u2019t super invested in the game yet at that point, but i absolute get it now. Sucks that you and my buddy got shot before we could make it out, but I managed to escape by myself with 4 kills under my belt. I\u2019ve still got that heavy stahlhelm you gave me, too.", "ID": "10bsy3q", "Score": 30, "Total Comments": 5, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/10bsy3q/to_whoever_helped_us_in_asteroid_mine_last_night/"}
