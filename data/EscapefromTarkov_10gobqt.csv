Mascaret69,When √† grenade is Handy...
jcarey4793,"Hey guys, enjoy the mosin. You earned it."
Killermen962,...most my impact nades are sourced from factory below med tents on a rubble pile that has a grenade case.... just so you know for future encounters :)
Woahboah,Holy shit now that's some shit
SpiritCrusher421,The Ole factory firing squad
Substantial_Cake3607,It‚Äôs silly because there is only 2 other PMCs that might extract there - that crew is disgraceful‚Ä¶this one should be easy to laugh off due to how pathetic it is ü´¢
Tropicalcomrade221,"Surely this is staged, a four stack exit camping for one dude?"
Stekun,Don't worry they won't survive the hammer
AttradiesLisanAlGaib,"*moans, burps, hail of bullets*"
Jai_chingnut,Why does tagilla moan like that
Hunter325i,"People take this game way to seriously, this is hilarious, and how can you judge people for going 4 deep on factory, Grenades exist for a reason, factory is just pvp fun me and my buddies run it all the time just for fun, it takes the all the bullshit frustration from questing and makes the game fun"
Library_IT_guy,I hope Tagilla came in there and destroyed all of them.
WoodeusPrime,"I love the coordinating blue, it‚Äôs amazing"
RichHedge,firing squad
TohkaTakushi,Bro met a firing squad XD
Luhtzo,'you know what would be a funny reddit clip'
V_Energy,This is the funniest shit
MBigz,This game....
Constant-Tap6617,When you stumble into a party you weren't invited to....
_Mr_Dino_,Is that a burb I hear right before you get mowed down?
BigToasster,If you queue up factory as a 4 man you should get a special label on your name like the streamers and EOD players do. Instead of it being a crown or something it should be a bicycle helmet
EZFrags,Its like being PKed in Runescape for your shovel by a clan
SurrealLemon,"it makes no sense to do this, only 6 PMCs can spawn on factory, best case scenario they kill 2 PMCs, that have some stuff from safe on them ü§¶ü§¶"
DunamisBlack,"I'm dying inside from the number of people jumping in to defend the extract camping 4-man, saying they are just having fun. Like... do you have ZERO standards you hold yourself to? Geez"
snoozieboi,I don't know why I want this to end with the Jackass guitar or something. This was basically a firing squad.
CAJ16,I'd be lying if I said I didn't actually giggle a little bit. I want to hate these guys but...
Daddy_Onion,I‚Äôve gotten my squad to do this before. Fucking tired of the extract campers. So we became what we hated most.
JustMattLive_Twitch,people that do that just know they gave up actually getting better at the game and are the low tier players of tarkov
MatchlessMarx,Seems staged\~
Karem857,Wait. Do you have the name of who killed you? This legit might be my squad lol we all had the same daily so jumped in real quick and waited to not get a run through lol
Repulsive_Voice823,"Neglecting to nade the extract

Not even once"
DarkastLegends,Ah yes ‚Äúrewarding‚Äù gameplay split the player into 4 parts after letting the whole map know your extract camping
Stoff3r,Zabrallo crew
Art-Is-Life,"To be fair, me and my friends would sit in that exit for 5 minutes or so (avoid run through) as  well if we had quests. But we would also spam voice commands so others would know and one guy ready at the door to push out if someone has the idea to throw in a nade."
Scavwithaslick,This why I nade gate 3 if I didn‚Äôt kill the pmcs myself
viking1313,"That's why I always use my factory exit key no matter what.

If you camp in there you gonna have a lonely boring game.

Also I never leave gate 3 as a scav"
DataAbject6446,"This is the exact reason me and my squad put a couple of shots straight down the left side, if any one was to be camping you'd hear the moan"
Resolve_Radiant,"If I don't see any PMC's all raid, Gate 3 gets an F-1 grenade. As a treat."
Mightypeon-1Tapss,"I always nade that extract, 9k is so worth for a shot at someone‚Äôs free loot and my kit is guaranteed that way every time. If i don‚Äôt have a nade i prefire the shit out of every angle"
lazzya,Ahahahhaha! Surprise!))
Overall_Molasses4097,thats unlucky rip
Gluckman47,Always come in that room with grenade in hand. Extraction to Valhalla.
XQuikX,Gg easy!
longliveveedub,"One grenade to kill em all, Mosin man"
nitsud_prime,This is why i never go gate 3
Lang9219,"my god...

&#x200B;

had no exit campers on G3 this wipe so far....fingers crossed

&#x200B;

but i also try to nade it when i can

&#x200B;

wasnt BSG planning on adding a ventilation shaft or something to the second big door so you can save nade inside to stop this shit?

&#x200B;

wonder when that happens

( i remember they said they looking into changing G3 and i think nikita mentioned like a door window you can nade trough etc)"
Procol_Being,"I get this is apart of the game, but damn I hate these people more than cheaters."
Kiiidx,Now we‚Äôve learned the value of peaking before running into a room
Youngprivate,Imagine if he flash em and got 4 knife kills ü§£ that alone should get you Kappa
Knoxx-reddit,u/savevideo
TacticalCyberpunk,4 man extract camping is pathetic but I love how dynamic Tarkov is. There's little to no room for error and it's so unpredictable. =D
RJBond,They had to just be memeing. Like a bunch of pals on discord just laughing over it.
BitterQuitter11,Dude cmon rofl
Volomon,This is why I carry a shit load of grenades.
willsueforfood,So.... that's what they do in between circle jerks.
edge449332,"And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why the Factory key is so valuable."
1DayNnight1,Shameless
Jazzlike-Jamaca4864,Oh yes‚Ä¶ the blue boys
Traditional-King1083,"Me and my friends do this once a night with ppshs and the ghoul mask. Never anything but laughs and we just leave the gear behind. Its a game guys, have fun."
EaterOfFungus,this is the only form of extract camping i‚Äôm okay with. it‚Äôs funny as shit and i might even do it some time with a few friends and some toz‚Äôs
stabbsen,GG easy (c)
TP_Gillz,"Blue Man Group - Firing Squad

New Album 2023"
rekonsileme,can't wait for when tarkov is open world and people like this will never be able to play the game again lmao
Alternative-Wealth13,That‚Äôs well funny fair play to em
mrfl3tch3r,But we need to know what happened when Tagilla arrived! :)
Leftical2,Hope the next guy has an impact grenade
RoboticControl187,A nade needed. Tagilla probably got them. Would have been cool if you got him into the room with them anyways lmao. They all cowards.
ALFA502,Firing squad camping for a mosem guy on factory..
Hungry-Opening-420,"That is sad, but funny :-)"
LanikM,Even if I had the time to do this I wouldn't. Damn that's gotta be so boring.
Ambitious-Kitchen639,Really? 4 manning gate 3? This game has gone to hell! (Wishes I had 3 friends to do this with)
BigMACfive,What a bunch of losers. I hope they're on here and see this.
Lanky-Structure-8838,Lol how bad do you have to be to be a four man and need to extract camp
