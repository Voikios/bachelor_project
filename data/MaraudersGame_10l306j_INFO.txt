{"Title": "The Red Baron - Patch #01 (LIVE)", "Post Text": "Space pirates, **Red Baron Patch #01** has just landed!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8acsw999x7ea1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c53d5080afeeb54f09c365578018ed2f9aa3ddd6\n\nThanks for your patience while we addressed the Market Trade bug that appeared over the new year. Your reports on this, along with reports on other bugs, have been instrumental in the completion of this Patch. Our main focus was to fix the Market Trader bug, fix the different crashes that players were experiencing, as well as address some inventory problems that were causing significant item loss, or ship loss. We\u2019ve done extensive testing to ensure the fixes we have implemented will work, however there is always a chance for an issue to slip through the cracks. So if you find any of the above issues continuing to reoccur, please let us know in [Discord](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=discord.gg/marauders), using the **ModMail** feature from the top of the sidebar!\n\nWe also took the time to add as many more fixes as we could, including updates to the UI and Sound. Oh, and we had a look at everyone's favourite weapon type, the Shotgun. Changes below!\n\nKnown Issues:\n\n* Localisation may be incorrect or missing, due to content changes. This will be adjusted and resolved throughout Early Access.\n\n**PATCH CHANGE LIST:**\n\nART\n\n* Tighter scratch damage on and improved normal map shading environmental objects.\n* A large number of item icons are now from textures instead of snapshots of items in-game (e.g. melee weapons).\n* Mosin Obrez now has an ironsight (front post).\n\nBALANCING\n\n* Terminator and Trench Gun have had their spread increased to be more inline with other shotguns, and to prevent shotgun sniping.\n* Liberator damage increased from 15x8 to 16x8.\n* Terminator shotgun damage decreased from 18x12 to

instead reposition or charge.\n\nSOUND\n\n* Tweaks made to gunshot sounds to help with spatialisation.\n* Tweaks made to the Howitzer turret and Large turret to help with spatialisation.\n* Cut dead space from the beginning of some gunshot sounds to make them more snappy.\n* Upped the max concurrency limit on some weapon shooting sounds (like the Thompson) to stop the shooting getting cut off when firing full auto.\n* Increased the volume of the pick up/put down Gold Bullion sounds.\n* Increased the volume of footsteps on glass while walking.\n* Increased the volume of crouching walking on glass..\n* Fixed missing sounds when using Esc to go back through layers of exit menus in-game.\n\nUI\n\n* QOL on crew password check menu, you can now press enter to try the password without needing
