We're now 10 years removed from GTA5. GTA6 better be a fucking masterpiece. Those leaks from last year don't give me hope though.... people have talked about a Vice city version sequel for 20 years, but I'm just not sure it can hold up to a NY/LA vibe. Hopefully GTA6 will come out this holiday season"
