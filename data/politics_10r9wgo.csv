TheSentientNFT,Oh shit hunter Biden’s actually real
FckMitch,Where is the investigation on two unelected WH officials who had access to top security documents and who later received $2B Saudi investment?
Colonel_Zander,Time for the GOP to produce some hard evidence!
Wasteland_Mystic,"Did anyone else notice that right after the midterms, almost every Republican who claimed that electing them would mean a Hunter and Joe Biden investigation all went silent on the subject?"
CBSnews,"Here's a preview of the story: 

Hunter Biden's legal team went on the offensive Wednesday, demanding state and federal investigations into the dissemination of material from his laptop, and threatening a defamation lawsuit against Fox News' Tucker Carlson for allegedly failing to correct false statements.

The flurry of letters to the Delaware attorney general, the Department of Justice, the I.R.S. and attorneys for Fox News and Carlson represent an aggressive new strategy for the president's son, who is facing long-running federal criminal investigations, as well as new probes promised by congressional Republicans, according to a source familiar with Biden's approach.

""This marks a new approach by Hunter Biden and his team,"" the source told CBS News. ""He is not going to sit quietly by as questionable characters continue to violate his rights and media organizations peddling in lies try to defame him.""

AmusingMusing7,"About time, actually. It’s long past due that the Right be held to account for their wild claims. Clearly, trying to just ignore or debunk it all isn’t working. They just persist and persist, make up new shit, and the zombie lies soldier on. Time to prove your claims in court or shut up."
BTree482,"The thing that drives Fox and Trumps family nuts is that no matter what Hunter has done or does Joe still LOVES him.  

However no matter what Eric and Don Jr do… big Daddy Trump will never see them or really care because, as an extreme narcissist, he only sees and loves himself."
Illuminated12,Hell yeah!  Start slapping them with that huge hog and lawsuits.
Belichick12,Should sue Elon musks Twitter for hosting pictures of his massive hog
Inside-Palpitation25,Finally someone is going to fight back against the traitors.
meeplewirp,"[republicans have voted against making revenge porn a federal offense numerous times in the last 3 years. things like the hunter Biden conundrum and the madison cawthorn endeavor shed light on why.](http://cybercivilrights.org)

He can still press both criminal and civil charges.  And I hope he does. Nobody has the right to see graphic sex of anyone without their permission and yes I would say people like Pamela Anderson and even Anthony Weiner and yes Madison Cawthorn are victims of what numerous modern day developed countries already consider a sex crime, whether you like them as people or not. You don’t have an innate human right to distribute pics of someone’s ass hole without a release form, sorry/not sorry"
Ozymandias_a,"Garrett Ziegler, a former Trump administration aide, called it a ""desperate attempt by ""Hunter and his family to get the attention off of their crimes."" Typical MAGA reverse think-omtertry."
ylangbango123,"Democrats who are being defamed should fight back.  Hillary should have done that.  This idea of If they go low we go high does not work because they dont have shame/conscience or ethics.  It just emboldens them as they think you are weak. Also turning the other cheek wont work for sociopaths.

I hope they do this too with people like Putin.  Call their bluff.  Stare them down especially if you are on the right and have the power or strength."
_JunkyardDog,The hunted becomes the Hunter.
flyriver,The best defense is offense.
pattydickens,"Hunter Biden vs. Jarod Kushner, in a no holds barred cage match, is the next logical course of action. As a taxpayer, I will settle for nothing less."
Thereminz,wouldn't it be funny if hunter biden was the guy who took down the entire gop
polyglamorous_gay,I’m not a big fan of the Bidens but I recognize revenge porn when I see it. I hope Hunter Biden wipes the floor with these ghouls.
steroboros,He's about to go Hulk Hogan on some revenge porn lawsuits.
KazeNilrem,"Hope he goes after them hard because I am so sick and tired of seeing organizations (not even going to refer to them as news) make all these bs claims that go against evidence, even when shown to be false, and just get away with it. The reason why this continues to happen is because there is no real accountability. They need to start hitting these companies with real financial consequences and then they will start taking their jobs seriously. 

This is why I hope Dominion wins their case and makes these people pay."
Olderscout77,"Hunter needs to speak with the folks at Dominion to see how one goes about suing a\*\*holes for liable. Pussbags like Jordan et al may have Gerrymandered themselves into office, but making them responsible for the lies they tell will at least keep them from getting rich."
einstein1202,"I was waiting for this moment. No way does some computer repair guy just start going through old emails and reading all the details and say ""oh I should call Rudy Giuliani real quick"". I'm not sure what they think Hunter did but I highly doubt its legal to give someones computer and data away to a stranger after first going through all his emails."
ooouroboros,GOP attacks on a non-political member of Biden's family are appalling. Imagine if Dems started attacking Barron Trump now he is no longer a minor.
tundey_1,"We're going to need so many lawyers, I don't think law schools are going to be able to cope with the demand. This is what the post-Trump GOP has unleashed. I wonder if I have enough time to go to law school and cash in."
Correct_Campaign5432,"I had a feeling that he is absolutely asking for a civil harassment restraining order.

These GOP motherfuckers can’t be trusted and should not be in a position of holding public office. 

Let’s ban together and make it unequivocally clear this horse shit has no place in America."
Koshakforever,GO get em Hunter. A Private citizen whose been tortured by a bunch of fucking squares for too long... squares. Don't stop til you hit the backs of their teeth.
BumperCarcass,GOP revenge tactics. But I’m sure a ton of them are just in it for the dick pic
Cost-Born,Good. Time to put these Republican bullies on the defensive..
windrider7,"I was beginning to wonder, assuming all the allegations against him are false, when he was finally gonna have had enough of their bullshit and start filing defamation lawsuits and such."
No-Consideration6589,Why do conservatives sexualize him and his dad?
Actual__Wizard,He should be suing and for a lot. The right wing slander and libel campaign against him is absolutely absurd in scale and damage.
iambic_paddler,He Bidened his time and now he comin' out swingin' ;-)
Important_Outcome_67,"Good!

Punch back."
PMMEBITCOINPLZ,"Oh boy, all my right wing Reddit pals who have been saying for years that Hunter had admitted to the details of the laptop narrative and there is NOTHING FISHY about it are going to have egg on their faces now that he’s demanding it be investigated. Bet they will immediately admit they were wrong and debate rationally and reasonably, with no conspiracy-mongering."
happyColoradoDave,"It always seemed strange to me that even if you did abandon a laptop at a repair shop, that they would be entitled to the data.  And then to take that data and share it with other private citizens.  Has anyone seen the laptop they supposedly got the data from, or could that be a lie to cover up the real source of the data?"
Farttopower,He should force Tucker to apologize to him face to face on Tucker's show.
s-multicellular,Hunter is not a 'public figure' by the usual definitions so I've been wondering when he was going to fuck them all over with defamation suits.
Skadzy,"Good for you, Hunter Biden."
Eddiebaby7,I think a massive series of lawsuits could do a lot of good.
formerfatboys,"I've been saying for months that there's no way they'll ever actually investigate because they're going to find that Russia hacked his cloud accounts and put his data on a laptop and found a blind computer store owner willing to play ball. 

This is a brilliant move. Dare them to find the truth because he knows along with everyone with half a brain that he never turned over a laptop to anyone."
Writer10,"Good for him.  The guy has simultaneously become a joke, deflection point, and a target.  Anything to keep the GOP from actually governing.  Rooting for him."
harrymfa,The Right’s priorities are such a dumpster fire.
RaymondLuxYacht,"I'm not a fan of HB by any means, but I agree that it's time to ""shit or get off the pot.""  Investigate and charge him or STFU."
Brief-Reflection9114,"OK, let me get this straight. The Republicants and neocons want to investigate a fellow who never held elective office, worked for a foreign company who their golden boy didn't like, is the son of the man who solidly beat their boy out of the Presidency (no, it wasn't stolen), and they will spend millions investigating him, and he never ever held public office or even worked for the Government? What is wrong with this picture? How much they spend on Benghazi? And not a damn thing to show for it."
Seeker_Alpha1701,"Republicans are going to regret gaining the majority of the House of Representatives once the non-existent case against Hunter Biden blows up in their faces. It was all about smearing the President who is his father, not Hunter himself over anything he might have done."
MaximumEffort433,"I'll chip in for the GoFundMe, he probably doesn't even need the money, I just want to stick it to the Republicans at this point."
Leather-Bug3087,Been waiting for this! Sue those motherfuckers. All they wanted was to see his dick pics anyway.
antigop2020,"This dude has his own demons and clearly benefits from being the Presidents son. 

But the right wing and MAGA obsession with him, like most things is blatant hypocrisy. The guy is not a govt official, hes a private citizen. Unlike the Trump children (Don Jr, Ivanka/Jared, and Eric) he did not try to influence the govt or work in his dads cabinet. And if you consider him a grifter, he is little league compared to the aforementioned."
Boobs_Maps_N_PKMN,Well well well well. How the turns have tabled in a very tably turning way
ithinkivebeen,"""You want to see my cock and balls, I'll show you my cock and balls.""

- Hunter Biden (probably]"
Illuminated12,I was wondering when this would happen.  NO ONE and I mean NO ONE should have to worry about a computer repair shop snooping through your shit and selling it to whoever.  Not sure how this guy isn't in jail for computer crimes and theft of information.  It would be one thing if he snooped and kept it to himself or the FBI.  It's a whole different ballgame when you make copies and distribute someone's personal info.
Gameofthroneschic,Good for him tbh
Unfair-Shower-6923,Damn they actually summoned him
buzzedewok,Finally going on the offense.  This is long overdue.
JuliusErrrrrring,A Democrat actually standing up for themselves?
xensiz,"I’ve never heard straight men talk so much about a laptop and his dick, may it be impressive if we ever see it lol"
NoHopeOnlyDeath,"If he's finally being allowed to go on the offensive after literal *years* of abuse, I can only imagine that him and his legal team have some bombs waiting to come out about Carlson and others."
theholyroller,"""It's an obvious attempt to silence America's Mayor, a man who took down the mafia."" Get fucked, Rudy, you insufferable piece of garbage."
gif_smuggler,If I were Hunter I would be throwing defamation lawsuits everywhere.
Bluefalcon1735,"To fuck with republicans, Hunter should say he's running for a house seat in Delaware as a republican. It will break their brain."
GhostFish,">A representative for Giuliani said in a statement to NBC News: “The work order is as clear as it can be. The laptop became abandoned property under John Mac Isaac’s control.""

Has Hunter acknowledged that he or someone working for him dropped off the ""laptop""?

Has the actual ""laptop"" been recovered? Last time I checked, the ""laptop"" was actually just a bunch of files that people claimed came from a laptop."
ShowerCurtainRings,Beware the hog of justice.
Salvia_McLovin,Hunter Biden is the deflection of the radicalized right.  He literally lives in their heads rent free until it comes time to scrutinize Trump.
Wild_Guess_7402,"Good for him, the whole trying to make him the bogeyman is stupid as he doesn’t hold any office and has no power.

Unlike boy king who put his fucking silver spoon kids in positions and gave them some power…"
Colonel_Zander,"The man said, ""no one fucks with a Biden""."
Grandexperiment,This motherfucker is gonna beat their ass down
Electronic_Permit300,Did Clucker Carlson ever find Hunter’s laptop? Carlson said FedEx lost it in transit. Supposedly it has the solution to inflation that the GOP is desperately trying to find.
WasabiPedicure,It will always be wild to me that Hunter Biden and Tucker used to be friends
BrownEggs93,"Fighting for what really matters for the american people, eh GOP?  Being putin's proxy here in the usa?"
lostoceaned,Dark Hunter has finally appeared!
T_Weezy,"Anyone who still refers to Rudy Giuliani as ""America's Mayor"" is a fucking joke.  Literally a walking punchline of a human being."
27bluestar,At least Joe didn't put Hunter on his staff.
SeaworthinessOne2114,"Good for Hunter, I'll donate to his legal costs.  Biden is not a threat to our national security, he is a private citizen.  Unlike Hunter Ivanka, Jared and DJT are all traitors and criminals, lived large on tax payer dollars while benefitting their own business ventures and Jared was very close to the Pretty Saudi Prince and then Khashoggie was tortured and murdered.  So leave Hunter alone and go for the real criminals!!  Trump and his toxic brood."
polarbears84,"Fight, fight, fight. Don’t let this bullshit go on and become a doormat. It is highly time Republicans get as good as they give, something that they’re unfortunately not accustomed to yet. (Just the thought that this imbecile McCarthy is two heartbeats away from the presidency makes me feel I’m about to pass out…)"
xeonicus,About time.  This whole laptop thing has been a political invention by Bannon since the beginning and it's just grown crazier over the years.
Sea_Dawgz,"I love it. Enough from these fucking Nazis. Go get ‘em
Hunter."
Kind_Manufacturer_97,Good. This is the biggest invasion of privacy of a private citizen that I've ever heard of.
SamuraiCook,"Someone must have realized that the more the American people hear about the actual history and details of the mythical ""laptop"", the more people will realize how much it is completely unfeasible bullshit."
rottenconfetti,"As someone who works with client data all the time…I’ve wondered about this from the beginning. I can’t just release client info, docs, or data for any reason ever, and never to a third party. I’ve always wanted to know what the hell the computer guy was doing handing off a clients things.  I’d be sued from here to Sunday for that shit."
ZodiarkTentacle,I’d smoke crack with Hunter Biden idk bout y’all
Kuroshitsju,"Good. 

The old ones in Congress seem to think its cool to harass a private citizen"
SaltinesOfSadness,Abbe Lowell is no joke. He doesn’t try cases in the media. He goes right for the face in the courtroom.
cbiancardi,"good.  he should do that.  the republicans are masters at gaslighting and projection, and will continue to pick away at any scab.  hunter is a private citizen, always has been.  he should fight back"
ting_bu_dong,">""This marks a new approach by Hunter Biden and his team,"" the source told CBS News. ""He is not going to sit quietly by as questionable characters continue to violate his rights and media organizations peddling in lies try to defame him."" 

Good.  Because otherwise?

>He says his short, quippy statement, and you give your detailed rebuttal. He then picks a single point from your response and attacks that as the new subject. Now, to an onlooker, the logical brain would register that he’s leaving 90% of your argument on the table, and that, by changing positions, he’s conceding he lost the first round. But the lizard brain notices that he’s always making the accusations, always in the dominant position, that he’s always acting and you’re always reacting. Regardless of what is said, he displays all the outward signs of winning. So, on a purely emotional level, he leaves the impression of being right.

They get to leave *the impression* of being right all day long, on their very impressionable base."
sedatedlife,Couldn't people get in trouble also for spreading the pictures of him. There is revenge porn laws and the spreading of the pictures was a concerted effort to dehumanize him and ruin his life.
rastagrrl,Good for him. He’s a private citizen who’s been defamed.
Alfie127,Good for him.  It's about time.
__________55,As long as we get more dick pics of Hunter Biden I’m ok with this - The GOP
Itchy_Mountain8167,I hope he sues them and wins so much money the republicans cut his taxes.
youareallsilly,The strategy worked for Dominion
rusyn,It's about goddamn time!
chunkmasterflash,Should sue them in civil court.  Make them go into discovery and show that they ain’t got shit.
fusillade762,The best defense is a good offense.
MadPeroX,"GOP, Fox News, OAN, NewMax and all their talking heads will will pay $$$$ when investigations find nothing illegal."
Immediate_Catch_9924,I think it'd be awesome  if he sued trump
Any_Classic_9490,">threatening a defamation lawsuit against Fox News' Tucker Carlson for allegedly failing to correct false statements.  

Just file it.  It worked against alex jones and it is working against fox news over election lies.

It sucks that prosecutors ignore fraud broadcasted in the media, but civil suits are quite effective against businesses and they don't stand a change in civil court where the standard of guilt is lower than criminal court."
gif_smuggler,I’m not sure this “laptop” even exists. Why would anyone leave a laptop at a repair shop with supposedly incriminating material on it and not bother to pick it up. It makes no sense.
Buck_Thorn,It was good to see him go on the offense.  And he did it in spades!
WaffleBlues,"A couple thoughts:

1 - Why did it take him so long..

2 - At this point, the guy has got to have a case for defamation against someone.  Fox News has been ranting about him for two years."
permalink_save,"> A spokesperson for Giuliani called the laptop ""abandoned property under John Mac Isaac's control.""

It's still illegal to access the material without authorization. It doesn't matter if it's abandoned."
acemedic,"I want to see a deepfake photo of Hunter chilling with Trump at a Russian hotel surrounded by prostitutes while doing lines of coke off the palm of Epstein’s hand. 

It’s amazing that the Republicans think this is what a majority of their constituents give two shits about. They shouldn’t get too comfortable in congress because they’re not focusing on actually getting anything done for the American People. Hell, I’d even be enticed to vote for straight ticket Dems next time and I’m a lifelong Republican voter. Good for Hunter for standing up for himself. 

Source: am a Republican who gives a shit about his country instead of circus clowns scoring political points on Twitter."
tacotheeater,"It's about time, gettem Hunter."
Sarkans41,lol I am going to enjoy watching Hunter Biden dismantle these fools.
NotmyRealNameJohn,"He should consider civil rights abuse charges 

Legislative immunity doesn't cover civil rights abuse and it will bring every senator and representative who has brought up false allegation  against him under question and since it involves stolen and disclosed private information I believe he has a reasonable case against the entire republican party"
The-Initiative,"Wait, so there’s actually a real laptop in question? I just assumed it was all made up by the right wing and ignored the story all these years. Hope Hunter goes Dominion on Fox."
dynamojoe,"That ""popping"" vibration you just felt through the soles of your feet was caused by thousands of GOP rectums puckering in fear of *Finding Out*."
wwhsd,"If he gets called before a Congressional hearing, I really hope his opening statement is something along the lines of:

“Let’s just get this out of the way up front. It’s $5 each if you want to take a look. An extra $20 if you want to touch it. No, I don’t take Venmo or Zelle.”"
First-Funnies,the best defense is offence (trump)
sictwo,About time he spoke up. Surprised he let it go this far
toomuchoversteer,Love it. They'll have to admit it's all fake or it wasn't his laptop. Lmao
supermegafauna,Dark Hunter Rising
Ursomonie,It’s about time. LFG!
trrup,And we are supposed to care for what reason?
re-capitalism,"Idc what your thoughts are on him, going after family of the president is pretty low."
archeusdevine,"Good, despite what he may have done and the position he gained due to jis family name. He does not deserve to be bullied and demonized by those fucking hypocrites."
md1501,Wait so if they investigate him and find nothing of value can he sue for defamation?
smiama6,It's about time he went of the offense.
Brodman_area11,"Good. Taking a play from the GOP playbook: never defend, always attack."
weezer-hash-pipe,"Hunter should be flattered that Republicans and MAGAs love collecting Hunter's dick pics.

Just sayin'.

/s"
Ozar06,Dark Biden rises
PurgatoryMountain,He should focus all firepower on Don Jr.
Lea_Lay,"Good. Long overdue. Tucker Carlson is a joke, said so in court but MAGA stupid think he is gospel lol"
valentineced,"This is what Republicans want for the country. Meaningless investigations for political revenge that,as with the Durham investigation, will either reveal nothing or crimes committed by their members. 
There has to be a better way to help the country and those that need the government’s intervention the most. Infrastructure, energy, pollution, vanishing water supplies, and homelessness could use the laser focus being applied to Hunter Biden…"
Additional_King3967,"I hope he wins across the Board.  I'll be watching closely on the Fox & Tucker Carlson lawsuits, I bet they'll both settle out of court."
stefanSfermat,He should start filing defamation and slander lawsuits.
