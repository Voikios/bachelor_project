Detector_of_humans,"Okay so people either arent familiar with **THE STANLEY PARABLE** or they simply don't realize the joke.

The board starts with the actually good sequels, then mediocre ones; they make you question it's need to exist. It's a seemingly normal list at this point. 

We are then presented to one that isn't even a game, completely breaking the boundaries of just a game, not only being one that has been lost but doesn't qualify.

Then the kicker, even below the previous one is a Dark souls 2, which was recieved so badly and was such a dissapointment to the fans that most would rather forget that it ever existed."
KitFisto248,"Left 4 dead 2, army of 2: 40th day, cod bo2: zombies, cod advance warfare: extinction, dying light 2 and infamous 2 all were great especially co op. Also I consider LoTR: return of the king and sequel because LoTR: TT was really the first co op of the series and RoTK was the best co op game damn near ever

Edit: also assassins creed 2, ezios story was amazing"
