justxkyle,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
BLUEacrossthepond,Lmao I drive past this regularly and never once stopped to think how old it is.
Lahoura,We have Mario Galaxy in Goose Creek SC too
Natalia_Groznaya,"The year is 2123.

The parking lot is now a row of hyperport docking pods. The streetlights are gone, light now being provided by the glow lamps of Sky-dome 37-g. The Gamestop is now a McZornalds, serving fast Centaurian cuisine at affordable prices.

In the window, the faded image of an extinct Earth Aboriginal wearing retro military gear can be seen. The Centaurians call him Master Chef, and it is believed by some that tentacle-tapping his image before meals brings good fortune."
SilverMagnum,Finish the fight.
thethesperos,I did NOT expect to ever see this GameStop show up here. Drive past this almost every week.
Papaofmonsters,"It's like movie theaters that keep old classic posters up.  Sure it might not be the feature, but it's a piece of history."
sirtagsalot,Here is crazy coincidence:  I have to go to a neighboring town in a couple of weeks. Rock Hill. I've never been to that area ever. I'm visiting a friend that is temporarily working in Fort Mill. I may stop by this Gamestop now that it's Reddit famous.
Arleen_Vacation,SC gang üåôüå¥
ElahaSanctaSedes777,"That‚Äôs a beautiful sight, nice looking GameStop"
topchief1,"Hey, that's my home store!  Best employees in the greater charlotte area, hands down."
McStabYou,That image reminds me more of GameStop than Halo by now
Automatic_Anomaly,That game really was perfect.
Chemical-Frosting909,IS THAT TEGA CAY -a sc native that now lives in CO
YuutaKenzigeki,3 of the GameStops in places I‚Äôve lived has had one of these. Great game and certainly a staple when it comes to physical games
Socratease1885,"Do GameStops have to be next to SportsClips, or is that only the law in some states?"
,[removed]
Specialist_Meal_5732,Best game ever
MODALLSOUL,I‚Äôve smoked weed right in front of master chief. Insane how many locals are in the comments.
LavenderCrownedCrow,"There's one in Sumter SC with Halo 3, Tomb Raider: Legend, and Sonic the Hedgehog: 2006 ads still up. Very nostalgic."
MetalDragnZ,"My first ever midnight release was for Halo 3. Being a teen that didn't drive and lived 4.6 km from the nearest EB games, that was one of the most intense bike rides of my life, balancing that big legendary edition box on one leg while trying to maintain balance with the other hand."
autumnaki2,Holy shit. Home town hit the front page. It's nice to see.
adamr94,Simpler times.
tteuhcsJ,That gamestop and the walmart behind it was my main source of video games most of my life. Always weird to see it on reddit
Sharpshooter188,Jesus. I cant believe that was almost 16 yrs ago. I was 23 at the time.  Miss those times. Bunch of us nerdlings set up 4 360s and ran 2 4v4 matches constantly.
Beautiful_Exam_1464,Still one of the best ad campaigns ever. Keep it up. Literally.
EstablishmentShot232,It's going to outlast the franchise soon enough.
landdon,The good old days. Hanging out at GameStop at like midnight with a bunch of nerds talking about whatever game you were all there to get. Getting free stuff occasionally and making new real friends. I met a friend many years ago in high school waiting on a Diablo release and we became close enough that we started monthly lan parties. I want to say it ran for at least 2 years and probably had somewhere around 20 PC nerds. What a time to be alive. So glad I got to do that stuff.
BangerBeanzandMash,Fort mill hell yeah
06EXTN,Fort Mill is so interestingly odd. I have cousins that live in Baxter Crossing and every time we go I kinda like it even more.
mr_edgeworthvii,Same with a GameStop on south hill in Spokane WA. Also has super Mario Galaxy as well
BigD905,I bought my switch at this GameStop

summernightsmood,And Halo 3 is still going strong too!
ITheNub,Hello fellow South Carolinians
VVolfGunner24,"As jealous as it makes me that other people get to see this, I'm also wowed by the places people are talking about in SC. I've lived in (still do) in SC my whole life and never heard of these towns/cities"
CorellianDawn,"Poor Master Chief, at this rate he ain't never gunna Finish The Fight"
nstav13,I remember going to blockbuster back in the 00s and seeing the posters for Halo 2 and later Halo 3. I remember renting and playing Destroy All Humans and Godzilla Vs Monsters a ton. That poster brings me back. H3 is still a banger.
Jsmoove1992,I drive past here almost every day lil
thegingerninja90,The gamestop near my house still has a Sonic and the Secret Rings window setup.

Edwardc4gg,Oh I‚Äôve not been by there in a few weeks. Thanks for sharing!
DancenOrigins,Oh shit that's close by. I should go sanp a pic
EvilDarkCow,"Man, that's a really nice looking GameStop. The ones in my area look like gas stations (and not QuikTrips)."
MinunsPlusle,Man I miss Fort Mill.
atk700,I'm going to look for that on the way home.
TT_Zorro,"I feel like the GameStop in Franklin Square in Gastonia still had this window last time I was there just a year or so ago. Hard to improve on, really."
Sambo_the_Rambo,Timeless
,[deleted]
jonstarks,its still bad ass
juicy-heathen,Theres one I'm Spokane WA with halo 3 and Mario Galaxy
VestPresto,Time is extremely slow in SC
krakenmyboy,Still got my legendary helmet out. Stay strong!
brucebanna34,Finish the fight
Kimmalah,My local Gamestop also has this picture on their window. I suspect a lot of them still do.
NEDGO,if i had the money i would fly there just to catch a sick photo in front of that bad boy
TheCreator777,"Don‚Äôt blame them, it genuinely looks good and it‚Äôs reminiscent of better times. I still remember the night I played Halo 3 on my brother‚Äôs 360 for the first time."
griffraff0701,Remember Halo
tylerprice2569,This made me happy
Jordan1719,Tega Cay rise up lol

BuSsYBoI-sTaYpOpPiN,"I swear this exact same shopping center exists in Buffalo, NY. They're just printing these things!"
Deusvalhalla,Man I miss the 2000s...

tempest_wing,How has it not bleached from the sun?
bilko797908,That‚Äôs Tega Cay not Fort Mill
AAMCcansuckmydick,If only HBO had the halo IP and not paramount with their master cheeks version‚Ä¶
jkess04,They know how to HODL
Xsylium0722,Was just there picking up my dead space copy. Tega cay sc
volcanostephen,Nice OP! I live in Fort Mill SC too! I recognize that Game Stop!
snarefire,"Don't draw attention to this! 

Otherwise some gamestop corporate shill will call the store and demand they switch to whatever new bullshit they think of"
topchief1,"TIL that most of us live in fort mill, and based on the traffic, that doesn't entirely surprise me"
radabble,I remember when this was installed. Crazy that it still looks so good after all these years!
Crafty_Substance_954,The gamestop in my college down had the Halo 3 window up until they moved locations in 2021!
OtterChrist,Hey this is less than an hour away from me. May have to stop by and pay my respects soon.
berensona,Lol golf cart town looooool
TheNappingGrappler,Load bearing poster
BCCDoors,We refuse to acknowledge that any other Halo exist beyond Halo 3.  The franchise ended on a high point... It was great.
LincolnParkZoo2,I hate the new Halo
FictionalX,They said they'll replace it when a better halo comes out....
Xbox,"""Welcome to our historic downtown."""
jjbombadil,"Nice! I grew up in Fort Mill. It used to be a small town but it blew up. Also the ‚Äúain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it‚Äù doesn‚Äôt hold up there now. Its all fancy now. There was a time when it was the southern equivalent of Letterkenny.

So just Letterkenny but we say ya‚Äôll not aboot."
Adeep187,I'm more surprised Gamestop is still goin.
agnostic_science,"Makes sense because Gamestop itself (brick and mortar video games seller) is a dated a concept as anything else. Quarter after quarter it continues to do poorly. Its future is doomed. As there will be no place for middlemen players like this for where the video game sales landscape is inevitably going (direct, streaming, digital, and maybe shrinking amounts of hardcopy sales sold through online vendors where there is loads of competition). Attempts to re-invent itself have failed. If it weren't for the meme stock craze and gme cult that sprang up, we'd be talking about this company like Bed Bath and Beyond right now. It will still get there. It will just take more time now and take a lot more investor cash with it before it finally goes."
Bigfan521,The Blockbuster in my hometown had a big Halo 2 poster in one of its windows until they tore the place down in the mid-2010s.
AlbertManus,Hope whoever takes over the store after Gamestop's inevitable bankruptcy keeps it.
hitmannumber862,They will all be gone [eventually](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/cogexn/).
Bigly_Star_Hole,GameStop is too cheap to replace that. It will be there until the store closes or the image is so faded it looks like shit.
Kushykush_,Salute this GameStop
Yohder,So excited for what GameStop has in store this year
12Southpark,Love GameStop
Charming-Forever-278,You get dibs when they go out of business
RedPanther1,"This is a pretty accurate picture of SC, and I don't even live in bumfuck nowhere SC."
AlbertHofmann01,This picture reminds me of looking at blockbuster when it was 2010.
phoenix7700,big prints like that are expensive and gamestop isn't doing that great. It'll be up until they go out of business and someone else buys the place.
bluegemini7,"As a former Fort Mill resident for about a decade, I actually think those windows aren't accessible. Not just because there's a wall-shelf of games on the other side but I believe they actually put a wall up so they could do hooks and stuff, so I think it's physically impossible for them to get to the window.

All is as it should be."
PrincessHootHoot,I've lost interest (and hope kinda) in GameStop
,[removed]
mynameisalso,3 window?
Guitrdude,I bet the cash wraps are by the windows. The window decal blocks on people outside from seeing the cash handing. There‚Äôs a cost for type of window tint and that‚Äôs probably why it hasn‚Äôt been changed.
ItsameMatt03,It's a classic image.
OHoSPARTACUS,2007 was truly the purest year for gamers.
Festey-The-Messy,"North Augusta, SC still has the Mario Galaxy window"

maesterbae,Crazy it hasnt washed out by the sun yet
Burt_McNasty,Ames IA still has the same one

mathfacts,It's John Halo. Dude is timeless.
crypticfreak,"I swear the east coast (especially the Carolinas and Virginia - included super secret West Virginia) have a thing for Halo. 

When I was doing AIT in Ft. Lee someone on post had an actual Warthog and it looked sick as fuck. I think it was a recruitment tool but still it was sick. Couldn't recruit me, I was already dumb enough to join. I've actually seen multiple of them while in the army. Once at freakin Ft. McCoy of all places."
ProfessorGlaceon,"I live close to fort mill, but everything I do has me heading north"

Pale-Wind282,Man I remember going to the midnight release for the game and skipping school the next day to lan with my buddies‚Ä¶time flies to fast.
unal991,"We have this one tech store with Skyrim, halo and mass effect 3 poster"
moenchii,The town I used to work in until last year had a clothing shop aimed at a young demographic (teens to mid 20s). On the side of the building in a side alley they had bug windows that were blocked by a vinyl wrap with advertisement of that store. That shit was straight out the early to mid 2000s judging by the outfits of the models on there...

hunter503,"I wonder if they still have the old school game fuel hidden somewhere in there. I miss that flavor sooo much, idk why they never made it a full time flavor."
UnfeignedShip,I think it's a toss up between Halo 3 and 2 as to which is the best in the series.
