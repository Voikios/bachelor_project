Zavodskoy,"Please stop breaking the brigading rules and rule 3 for insulting people, this thread will be locked too if it continues."
krylassa,"You know what the problem is? I recorded a couple of cheaters that were flying all over Lighthouse and onetapping everyone in the eyes, created tickets through launcher and website, attached video evidence and I get an answer after TWO WEEKS that BSG don’t ban people manually and I should have reported the cheater myself in the end screen. I see, I see."
bobthemutant,"Issue #1: Streamer needs to check their ego and stop begging BSG to ban people that kill him.

Issue #2: BSG needs to stop manually banning people based purely on the word of streamers they have direct contact with.

Absolute horseshit that infamous cheaters can literally flyhack for several wipes in a row with the same name, same account and not be banned. 

But as soon as a streamer they trust cries like a bitch BSG issues a manual ban without any reasonable evidence beyond their word."
SwatHound,"So what servers do you play on so I can like. not play there.

And my condolences, but at least you're free now. 

Maybe if he dies enough times BSG will eventually go ""okay maybe they weren't all hackers""."
joemiken,">There's a tree you can hide in next to resort on shoreline (that I learned from watching exfilcamper)

KoalaHulu,This game became such dogshit after BSG started sucking off streamers
xxJim,can you link a timestamp from his vod?
AlcoholicSkeleton,So you saying I need to now record my game every time I kill a PMC incase I get banned?
Solaratov,"Another day, another new way that BSG demonstrates their incompetence as a devteam. 

Well done BSG. It's clearly a fulltime job to fuck up this much."

grimshogun,"Honestly, his sherpa status needs removed from all this."
TECHNOV1K1NG_tv,"The fact that BSG wholy trusts some streamers to ban players without any checks tells me they truly have no idea what they are doing when it comes to cheaters. There should be so many ways to check for legitimacy beyond a streamer typing your ign to a discord mod, but they don't even look into that stuff. Either they don't have the tools to do it, or they don't care. Sure, let the streamer make a report. A lot of deaths in this game seem sus as fuck. However, it needs to be a TRUST BUT VERIFY system. VERIFY being the key word. I thought this was what happened when streamers reported directly to BSG, honestly that's lazy af."
william21south,"I'll let you know if anything comes of my case. Hopefully we get our accounts back brother, wish you luck."
JoseMnez,"That Rengawr was so bad, all day crying... Hes a 9 year old kid."
Chompskiii,"Similarly, I love LVNDMARK but I have a friend who was banned after killing him from a bush he could see LVNDMARK through but couldn’t be seen from. He killed him and him and his chat called him a cheater and he was banned during his next raid. Tried to get support but his ban was never appealed and he was only able to play after getting a new PC."
Evening_Elk_6531,Mod.. He's insulting his self and the way he's abusing the system. We've seen multiple post with proof this streamer has abused his ability to ban players. Nothing can be said on this thread that isn't hard truth. Let the people speak.. Stop trying to sweep this under the rug. You have a community of gamers. We talk different. Don't censor us.. Otherwise you become the bad guy as well.. I've seen you lock a thread already involving this guy and at this point it seems like you're protecting him..
tugrulserhat,"I'm gonna comment on the other post here because tarkov mods...This ""streamer"" has absolutely no game sense/knowledge. As someone who has around 4k hours in this game, as soon as he claimed that ""he's being thoraxed"" I knew he was full of shit because you can see on top left health thing that the damage he is taking is distributed evenly on the body parts he had left. And he has no game sense because that rock at the base is smaller than in the middle where his head is and the other guy shooting at him could easily see his legs while he couldn't see anyone because of the shape of the rock. No cheats, not even desync and he calls cheats. Dude literally has no game knowledge and still makes money out of it streaming while getting others banned for no reason..."

Adeyotol,So it’s just not safe for any to play EFT except Streamers and Hackers. BSG hates their player base.
anythingfortacos,Already decided I am done w all of his content on all formats.
Event82Horizon,Oof this is getting really bad.
Only_user_online,"The other post seem genuine and thought out he provided valid information and a source, this seems like a cheap attempt at trying to get unbanned im not inclined to believe that any of what you say is true, I feel like anyone could’ve come up with this."
fetzitheclaymore,What the hell is rengawr ?
DickeTitten69,Inb4 the mods lock this one too.
majadu5,"The other post was actually put some effort in to it, some evidence would be nice of what you claim...."
Bl1ndVe,This shouldnt be something possible for some random nobody to be able to ban people at will just because he has connections in BSG
metrize,"honestly people should just say gg and move on. stop abusing your power, people pay like £150 for this game and they shouldn't get randomly banned just because a streamer was angry they died. this guy goes for kappa every wipe why does he cry over every death, deaths mean nothing in tarkov especially people like him who have all day to grind"
loongod5,"Pussy ass mods, Rengawr is out there getting innocent players *Manually* banned and here you’re worried about him being insulted."

Ok-Street-7240,Also let’s not manually unban streamers that get banned multiple times.
william21south,Damn bro I'm sorry. Trust me when I say I know how you feel lol
SilhavyD,"BSG only cares about streamers, even in their balance changes"
OkazakiNaoki,so it's a toxic streamer?
Gourds2theMoon,"I was on an Interchange raid during nighttime and a streamer GrandadPallyTTV chased me around for a good 25min. He always saw me no matter which bush i was trying to hide in. He shot at me all the way from the highway through the wood part near train extract, across the highway again until he got me at the water pond. 

I actually hit him back twice when he went full sprint across an open field during moonlight. And he accused me of cheating and reported me as well (and also texted me his accusations). He killed me after I tried to run away for 25min and I am the cheater because how dare I shoot back. Some of these cheaters really have some ego issues."

SOVERElGN_SC,Wish streamers used their influence on BSG for providing feedback aimed on improving gameplay and tech features but just whine on guys who dared to kill their majesty.

RideSpecial7782,"This game is made for streamers.

They keep making the game grindier and grindier because they finish everything too fast.

Now they can even enhance armor even more when they reach elite level, no casual player is getting there, it will favor even more streamers with end game loot and skills being literal tanks while moving faster and jumping walls to dunk on people and make the game look fun on stream.

As long as cheaters avoid streamers it seems like they keep their accounts forever, but one word from a streamer and even a legit account is done.

Regular players are just fodder for streamers to make the game look good and sell more. Nothing more, nothing less."
sw3rvyyy,"Soooo funny how EU is just filled with chinese names blatantly cheating all day on maps like shoreline, lighthouse etc. and you get banned for killing a streamer. Good job BSG, you're killing it guys. Game's literally unplayable in my region because of chinese boosting rings and you spend your time banning a 1k hr 3k.d player. Yesterday I had 3 raids in a row where I got killed by BLATANT cheaters, full on speedhacking and everything and i bet you their account is still around right now...."
SystemEmbarrassed366,"these things make me hate the company...just feels hostile, and don't get me started on the stupid entitled streamers that cant deal with some reality checks"
guitarero666,We need a fking kill cam. It would stop these discussions
Vubor,"Not one streamer should have the power to get one manualy banned! Like NO ONE not even the biggest streamer for that game, UNLESS he is the producer of the game and only THEN if its like 100% safe that the enemy was cheating!

Shit happend in wow with a streamer who had a gamemaster as a friend and that dude got banned like few hours later, gm lost his job and the streamer from that point on had like a very bad reputation on his server and over all."
jtnether,"Did either of these guys get account back? Can we get some fucking accountability from the streamer and BSG? Like, this is a total abuse of power and it is not ok. Its disgusting

Edit: his chat is subscriber only to keep the redditors off I guess. Good luck OP."
flatspotting,Rengawr is a fucking loser
foxfire1112,Mods locking these threads about abuse of power is so fkn weak
peeparty69,"u/trainfender I know you’re too fragile to read reddit anymore but hopefully you see this before the bootlicking mods delete it: as a software engineer your dev team is an absolute JOKE. you get what you pay for with engineers, please use some of the hundreds of millions you have made from cheaters to hire better people that know wtf they’re doing"
Snlfrd,"Watched him get shot in the leg and stomach and make it to cover in a stream. Called hacks and when the guy pushed him, rengawr was able to kill him. He literally said o the guy was definitely hacking he just turned them off. That was the last time I watched him, really wish I had saved the clip bc it was just so damn funny. The dude sprayed and hit your leg and stomach and you're calling hacks. Just terrible sportsmanship."
BerserkLifter,"Really, this Rengawr guy needs to get over himself. Getting people banned instead of just clicking next like the rest of us."
MOR187,so now you basically have to buy a new account only because of that idiot.?
z3phs,"BSG only cares about babying the public opinion. 
Half the streamers are babies.
Sus deaths are hard to even be sus about because of shitty servers. Should have 0 proof. 
Wanna ban someone? Get the flyhackers, the god modes, the floating boys, the 3 headshot pst from 100meters boys like stop playing around. 

Game right now is a hot mess"
Mjrdr,"Rengawr getting some heat on EFT Reddit as of late.

And tbh, he deserves it apparently.

Guy is top 5 in the world for speed-running Kappa after wipes, and fucking cries about cheaters after every death it seems. Being so fucking petty as to request bans for the people that kill him.

The ironic part of it is the people that are getting banned are blatantly NOT hacking.... Like, the dude has youtube videos of factory where a dude triple-taps him in the face (wearing an altyn) with a pistol and that doesn't phase him, doesn't think the dudes cheating (probablybecause he disnt die to him)....  But gets leg-meta'd on Woods and instantly reports his killer and DMs a BSG admin to ban his killer.

Dude has some serious ego issues."
Lucien899,"The plot thickens and its absolutely sickening that him as a streamer/sherpa has the ability to message someone and get a person banned on his suspicion and not actual evidence.  Plus the audacity to immediately accuse because he died from a shady death ... Do what everyone else does of you think you died in a suspicions way just report them in the death screen and move on . 

I  won't ever watch that streamer just because of how he treated the dude even after he realized the dude wasn't cheating .  


BSG your devs should not be talking to streamers about banns idc if they are friends are what they should use the same proper channels to report just like everyone else because if not you have this exact situation qhere a streamer can power trip and report anyone and get them banned on the fly"
snorkelbed,Another case of BSG being a fantastic company. Who knew.
Odd-Accountant3672,Damn

Liamnelson95,BSG should just add their own internal anti-cheat and sanity check things.  If midair > 10 seconds = account review.  Sprinting for longer than normally possible @ given strength / endurance / weight = acct review.  Trigger an internal only recording or something and review the videos or let the community review the videos if they’re too cheap I guess. Seems like it would be easy enough to code in.
NgryRed,"I was buying groceries the other day, minding my own bussines, when 2 security guards came to me saying that I have stoled 2 tushonkas and an Aquamari, and escorted me out of Goshan.

It felt wierd at first, now im positive it was Rengawr."
The_Corrupted,"I don't want people like this in this community, guy needs to go. This is awful behavior."
NemoSHill,"This guys spends 90% of his time looking at twitch chat, he has no clue about his surroundings, he just sprints across the map while looking at chat, dies to someone and calls it a sniper or cheater"
SSHz,"BSG could care less of a fuck if any of us ""normies"" gets killed by a cheater, but make a streamer go through a ""bad experience"" that makes the game *look* like it has cheaters in it and it's the manual ban service.

I mean, come on guys. We can't go and kill the games main promoters. How will BSG ever sell EoD accounts if they streamers show cheaters live?"
Satta23,egomaniac
rootedoak,I think I will try to stream snipe for my play session today.
Kleeb,"My biggest takeaway here is that it seems like BSG doesn't have a way to independently verify these accusations. 

Like, I'm okay with content creaters having a rapport with devs, and even be encouraged to reach out in the case of suspected cheat use, but BSG needs to independently verify the accusation. Because it seems thus far that they don't, I'm getting the impression that they can't, which is a huge problem."
MaDJaM_UK,"Proudly banned from Rangawr's chat a year ago for calling him out on this stuff. 

He makes great Youtube videos but like Veritas, is an awful streamer, they need a lot of editing."
matteusman,Show a clip please
Nikazone,Lvndmark does the same thing. Immediately calls everyone a hacker if he dies but I guarantee most of these steamers are running ESP.

CultureNecessary3487,"I was false banned legit a week ago, and have heard NOTHING back from either BSG or BattleEye. I changed some settings in my BIOS to enable XMP not 2 minutes before trying to login and was banned AS I WAS LOGGING IN. This is absolutely insane. On the small chance someone from BSG sees this. My ingame name is “MiseryS”"
redroverdestroys,"I remember on Warzone a similar thing happened with Timthetatman, he got killed and then cried for some in raid cheater to kill the guy who killed him. Of course the guy wasn't cheating, and nothing happened to Tim for what he did.

These top streamers are really a bunch of whiny brats. They know their power with devs and their audiences. They are not idiots. They know what they can get away with. 

I really fucking hate streamer culture."
stelkurtainTM,"I got perma banned for saying “Sherpa btw” as a joke in his chat, like a year ago.  Looks like he’s still a raging pussy who has proven even further he doesn’t deserve Sherpa."
GreenTea98,common mod L for trying to say it's brigading for insulting when it's just bringing to light things someone has done so everyone can make an informed opinion on how to feel about this topic knowing it isn't the first time it's happened lmao
justAnotherLedditor,"If nothing comes of this, start a chargeback to get your money back.

Next step if that fails is a small claims court.


 Mention multiple people have gone through this and if there's enough a lawyer might be interested and work a bit of magic to prompt a response.

BSG will respond regardless when VISA or PayPal get involved."
Secret-Gantleman,Kinda scared to shit on people in tatkov with my honed rat skills now
LegitimateProcess211,I feel you man. This would have been my third wipe and I got home from school to a 229 and all 10 ish emails i sent to bsg have gotten the same response word for word. Really sucks because I had paid for eod two weeks before
getgroovyloony,We all need to stop playing this game yo
Lazypole,"Streamers have always had too much influence over BSG and their decision making process, but bans? Jesus.

People used to love the preferential treatment of streamers, even defend it because man they love watching these guys, but now you're facing the problems it causes, have fun if it happens to you."
smellow97,Video / proof ?
KebabSmuggler,thats a beginning of another me too movement.
Sad_Temperature_7455,BSG should be fixing Desync and all other shitty bugs that make shit like this possible. The streamers who are the front of EFT are clearly getting people banned falsely.

Squint_Squint,This is becoming way to frequent if I had a nickel for every person that got banned manually or killing rengawr I'd have 2 nickels. It's not a lot but it's weird that it happened twice. Now if I had a nickel for everytime I saw someone on this subreddit get banned manually due to a streamer or a dev I'd have at least 5 nickels which isn't a lot but way to many.
Vidimus_Vicimus,People taking these posts at face value without any solid evidence of anything. So gullible.
AxTROUSRxMISSLE,Oh wow streamers ruin games?! Im shocked

Vinddictive_,Dude the mods are trying so hard to suppress this shit it’s so cringe lmfao
Relevant-Battle-8848,He already addressed the issue. It's not his fault it looks like cheating when it desyncs like that - all he does is report what looks like cheating from his perspective. It's on bsg for not reviewing it truthfully. You all would report that shit instantly also so don't act up you virtue signalers
eddyxx,"Exfil camping is now banned?  FINALLY, VERY COOL!"
nlewis4,These Rengawr posts are a perfect example of how this community has gone full salem witch trials about cheaters

chroeboy,But yet they LET some of the streamers blatantly use esp lol. Games going/gone to shit.
throwawaytogame,"People just need to record their game when playing. Or use a clipping software. You can make as many claims as you want, but it doesn't prove shit. You were banned. Either provide evidence you were not cheating, or buy a new account."
BlazingShadowAU,This shit is really why it would be nice if they'd have a system where the game tracks the location/health stats of each kill/killer and that can be imported into their dev version of the game to see the moment the kill occured to know what happened. Something as simple as the two models of the players with a line drawn between them of the killing shot.
Crazy-Turn225,"I feel worried about the last post from guy who killed streamer and gets banned. As he says he didnt cheated and get banned from twich streamer because he got kill with help of desynchronization. 

I really dont want to be ban, because ive got some rare kill. And because someone think im cheating, this game cost to much for someone just says you are cheater and BAM, instantly ban and account delete. Without checking all software stuff and watching replay of gameplay. And i dont know what else checking like in other games."

homing_bear,My biggest regret is having paid these BSG crooks. I haven't got banned or anything but still infuriated. A few months ago i was trying to convince people to join me in tarkov but from now on i'll do my best to convince everyone not to buy the game and join this shitfest.
Kuraloordi,"Some of the most silliest things in this game would be that streamers are given chance to get people banned based on their own experience. I mean this game desyncs like nuts, so that means rengawr eventually gets every player banned if everyone is cheating who kills him."
PentaxPaladin,I've been reading this sub quite a bit and have been wanting to play this game for a few months now but stuff like this is why I dont know if I will ever play the game

Goober_Dude,"Most of these suggestions seem like they would work if implemented. Considering all of whats lead up to today in this game, does anyone actually think that this game will ever achieve what they stated it would be? BS has showed almost no action to deal with the cheaters besides penalizing the entire player base with pedantic rules for trading.   
I still believe BS is looking at the cheaters as just another source of income and count on them purchasing so many accounts to keep their numbers pumped. There's a literal financial incentive for them to NOT ban them."
painfully--average,Good thing  I suck at the game
Masoz89,"With these stories, I’m like….do I even feel like shooting other players? xD"
Salamimann,"The game is stupid for being so laggy and causing desmyc so everyone thinks theres even more hackers than there are already. And then devs give streaners too much power to get you banned in an instant.

GardenofSalvation,"Hey mods can we maybe get some moderation on here was talking to somebody and they blocked me and reported me and I'm pretty sure a guy who agreed with him to reddit care services for being suicidal, surely there is some rule against this lol"

Shpongled_Alien,"Good ol’ battlestate and their relationships with streamers. I’m almost certain they’ll fix this, but damn this has happened way to many times

They need to actually fix cheating lmao

Streamers ≠ anti cheat"
,[removed]
Opetyr,Streamers should have their own server. That way they opened nah each other until the worst player is the only one allowed on that server.
TimmeTehWise,"Seeing this, along with the other issues is really making me think quitting is a good idea, at least until BSG can fix this issue, because I really don't need to lose access to the game I paid 100$ for because I accidentally killed some streamer, this was the same reason I quit PUBG, and it's ridiculous but unsurprising.

At the end of the day streamers are just worth more as players,and BSG already has our money, so there's always going to be heavy discrimination, I just hoped that it wasn't to the point where I can't actually play the game for fear of getting my account locked.

If this is truly the case, that I can get banned for killing a streamer, I guess I'm just going to go play ER again... I really want to like and enjoy this game but every time I try there's some huge set of overwhelming flaws that make me realise the game isn't even playable, it's just the trailers that I enjoy, because the actual product runs at 11 fps on streets and is a massive unreasonable time commitment.
 And I was fine with those 2 large flaws, but when they set the precedent that you can be banned for killing streamers the game isn't a game anymore, it's just you filling up the lobbies as a bot so that the streamers can look more impressive when they kill you, and drag more people into the game. 

I hope this isn't the actual case, and if it is I hope BSG fixes it, because I enjoy the game when I can actually play it, but This like this make it unplayable.

This is just my opinion though, I really hope this is just a mistake on BSG's part, because Tarkov has so much potential ,and it is already an excellent game, when it works, but if this is the direction BSG moves in I won't be able to justify playing this. There are always alternatives, and even if this continues happening, if the price to play gets much higher I will value these alternatives more than this game, and I will move on to a different better product."
Xinexan,so they can just ban whoever they want because theysay you cheat and that means theydonteven need evidence? ngl this makes me want to uninstall even tho i played my first game today lol
Kadamace,"reng something better get this guys account back, dude's ego is all over the place"
Accomplished-Note386,Anyone see his video he just put up? How sad lmao
Sneaky_Rhin0,"i didnt even know who renga was but seeing how he treats enemy players and combined with pulling shady side strings, directly dming admins to ban without proof or when there are proof against cheating is disgusting, and he acts entitled and wont apologise, atleast man the fuck up and be a human being? honestly how is a person like that a sherpa? 

i had a guy flyhack and tell me where all the dead pmcs were when i scav into streets, i killed him & i recorded it and took his dogtag and sent it to bsg and they told me nah not enough evidence from the launcher ticket (they dont use video proof apparently) but a streamer can dm his buddy and ban others for no reason?"

stay in its little niche bubble."
Morrowindlover,What is still missing from both of these posts is a clip showing your OWN point if view of the kill. Weird how thats missing in the one that blew up.
