stabyourcat,There‚Äôs an achievement if you carry this thing to the end of the game.
Maccaroney,"""Jar""  
Unplayable"
Mr_Seezy,"*reads item name*

‚ÄúFeels like a joke that Rick and Morty would pull‚Äù

*sees its High on Life*

‚ÄúOh that makes sense‚Äù"
Some_Case_7087,BROTHER. THE GENESEED BROTHER.
RalftheMedic,Is it consumable? üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ
A_random_wierdo,"""There goes our 'E for everyone' rating"""
thefastball530,I felt bad for the red gate man so I called him hot
Icy-Donkey-9036,What ridiculous game is this?
Baneman20,This game is so reddit
Mavrickindigo,Didn't roiland beat his wife?
LowIronLvls,Over-enCUMbered
yaosio,There's a strip club achivement that claims you get it for spending 8 real hours in the alien strip club. That's the best one.
Blitzstrikers1,"""Press X to chug"""
ausmomo,That's not a jar. Can we pls get some realism?
LogicalDelivery_,I can see why they spent so little on advertising. Justin Rollands fanboys clearly have it covered.
RichWPX,"The game is called high on life, and I really wish people would stop uploading posts which don't mention what game it is. But perhaps the mods should remove them"
CTRL1_ALT2_DEL3,"yet again, nobody mentions what game it is"
mitchumi,And of course you idiots can't give game tittle
leplushy3,*Aggressively Drinks*
GhostalMedia,"High on Life was one of my favorite games from the past year. Gun play wasn‚Äôt Bungie tier, but that works and story were a really well done. 

I can‚Äôt believe I watched an entire movie in that stupid game."
Samtoast,That's a jug not a jar.  Only jars are jars.  And doors.  Doors can also be jars.
Seegson-Synthetics,"If you‚Äôre going to post a screenshot about a game, post the fucking title of the game as well."
forwalmartstuff,My god this game seems insufferable
,Hilarious üôÑ
,Still white huh?
estrusflask,"This game is so fucking cringe.

It honestly isn't a surprise that Roiland is a sex pest."
SteveCalloway,"That is certainly not a jar. In order to be a jar, the vessel must be widemouthed, and have no handle. However, a jug is a large deep container with a relatively narrow mouth, and does have a handle. That is a JUG of precious alien cum."
TruePadawan,"Since people have complained about not knowing the game, why not update the post title and put the name or put it in the description."
Lil-Ruffstarrr,"#HIGH ON LIFE

is the name for everyone who is wondering"
TheGreatYoRpFiSh,"This thread and it‚Äôs ever growing crowd of disgusting weirdos is what makes Reddit great. 

I am just so proud to be one of you and to be have stumbled in to bask in the degeneracy. 

Thank you all"
Gnarfledarf,Is this that unfunny Rick and Morty game?
CubeKun,"AWW JEEZ I DIDNT MEAN TO ABUSE MY PARTNER RICK, AAHH MAN THATS NOT COOL AHH JEEZ"
big_ma05,The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcarrying a garden gnome through the whole game appeals to me more than carrying this one.
Bogg1e_the_great,I‚Äôm just mad I couldn‚Äôt buy more. Lil homie jizzed a gallon and was out for the next 6 missions or so
SyncDingus,Concealed carry that shit and smack a boss to death with it.
Favorite_tortilla,This is part of my everyday carry.
krukson,"I started playing it yesterday, and got hooked right from the beginning."
DankRedPandoo,The random entirely optional side interactions is really what sells me on this game
SladeSM,What in the Saints Row fuck is happening??
xDxRockx,"*Intentionally purchased*

Yeah, so?"
,"I don't know anything about High on Life, but I'd expect this kind of thing from a Postal game."
beryOP,"In retrospective, would've been something to make use of it for the [insertion] ."
Franonimusman,Should I ask what this game is about? Cuz I have several questions
Zapinsure,Let me guess. High on Life.
PolThePol,"Let me guess, high on life?"
JoshRiddle,What game is this?
Trumeg,What game is this? High on Life?
Ok-Bodybuilder1148,I just want some alien cum
BlackLeader70,A gallon of pcp is better.
FlexViper,Milk is milk
God_of_the_sauce,Press X to drink aggressively
FlopsMcDoogle,Are we even allowed to laugh at this now that we know Justin Roiland is an abuser?
Evilmaze,How do we still not have a rule to include the game title in posts?
Camilo543,lamest game of the decade
dummyTukTuk,"Lmao, I bought it yesterday"
ErasedEnvy,What game is this ?
Sulohland,Thats a huge load you got there
Walid918,bruh was this game made by a redditor
VolcadoDePila,WHY
B32gtaP,Sureeeeeeeeeee‚Ä¶
LuckyRune88,OP has some weird Kinks
Dreadlordstu,"That's no jar, that's a jug!"
5W1TCHY,I was on the fence about if I should play it or not. Thank you so much for turning me away.
revtim,I would not describe that as a jar
theniwo,intentionally
frivelousendeavors,Is there a backstory for this? Like clean up from some crazied alien bukkake party? Or does their natural alien physiology just make them jizz buckets?
LuiizzBR231,###*d r i n k i t d r i n k i t d r i n k i t d r i n k i t d r i n k i t d r i n k i t*
Nooblord07,What‚Äôs the game
Accenin,Is this game really good?
Wonderful-Impact1720,Haha I bought the shit outta this
_ytrohs,That game is so fucking cooked I swear
Akroyar,Very generic and forgettable game.
SmegSoup,"The meta humor..  it never ends.. and I just can't do it. """"Omg I'm a gun and you're shooting aliens in fucking spaaaaaace holy shiiit"" ""good thing this games rated mature"" SHUT. THE. FUCK. UP. I can't wait for a mod that removes the meta humor (which would mean 95% of the games dialogue) so the few funny jokes can be exist without being sandwiched between ham fisted meta bullshit. Couldn't do more than an hour before I got tired of the morty gun basically shouting ""wee we're playing as a character in a gaaaaaaaame!"""
EnvironmentalBet440,"Wtf? It's just, Cum..."
Glam_Zombie,Wonder what it tastes like
ares395,I swear to fuck there needs to be a rule in place that you need to put the fucking name of the game in brackets in the title. Every time someone posts some bizarre shit and you have to dig through comments because it seems like every person in the world knows what it is but not you and to others apparently it's so obvious that they don't feel like saying the title of the fucking game.
alan251,"So much middle school humor in this game, don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so popular. Figured people would get tired of it after the first hour of the repetitive stuttering and recycled Rick and Morty jokes/voices"
RogueAgentV,There's another (a third) brother who also sells these type of goodies! Have you found him?
Bullrawg,Lez do it!!
izukyo_simp,üòãyummy
CritikillNick,Glad I finished this before all the Roiland stuff or i never would‚Äôve touched it now. The Tim Robinson gun sure made me laugh though
MysteryPlaid,"Does reddit actualy like this game or did they just make this game for reddit and keep desperately making posts like this to make it seem funny

This is not funny"
Joverby,Is this from that mediocre game with alleged groomer Justin Roland ?
guineapig_69,Can you beat your gf or groom a teen in this game? But in all seriousness my wife don't wanna play it anymore cuz she mad about the accusations.
IndigoDonDotta,I want it in me
AzureOverdrive,Those poor earth women and gay men that get hit with alien creampies.
J0E_SpRaY,"To Be Fair, You Have To Have a Very High IQ to Understand Justin Roiland's humor. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head."
trowin_away,"oMg iTz sOoO fuHnNeeee, iT sAyS cUm! hArHaRhArHaR

iTz iNteLLiGenT hUmOr dUrpY dUrP 

smh, man children finding this funny is sad..."
Mary1537,Things I did not think I will see today
IndigoDonDotta,Imagine the TASTE üëÖüí¶
shoxwut,This sub has become so degenerate

Chakov,\*below the description\* **CONSUMABLE ITEM**
Diviner_Sage,I think someone needs to take it back to the store they bought it from.  I think it's past expiration and the seal also looks tampered with.
,People with this kind of humor belong in labor camps.
Ingenium21,HAHAHAHAHAH SO FUNNY! OH MY GOD WHAT HIGH BROW ERUDITE HUMOR THIS GAME IS.  ONLY SPECIAL LITTLE SMART BOYS LIKE US WOULD GET THIS
T3lebrot,I instinctively knew this was high on life
Caffeinated_Cucumber,That's disgusting! Where?
Dax9000,I guess you had to be there.
lordkamael,Yummy give it a chug
Winnipesaukee,Did they make a King of the Hill game and have that as an item for Dale to collect?
ChaosCelebration,This is why Dan Harmon is actually what makes Rick and Morty watchable.
GeneralEi,Not even a jar. Fucks sake
Rabite2345,You got spunk kid‚Ä¶ now clean it up.
