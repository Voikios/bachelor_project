houghi,"Oh you sweet summer child.

Just a heads up. Each two tiers is about as big as all the previous ones together. So when you start Tier 7: Welcome to half-game. And it gets worse, way worse.

Do you feel violated already?"
mTz84,"I did it the other way around and it was way worse.  
Computers are much easier than HMF, no worries!"
Browncoat765,Dude I am 120hrs in and I am just starting oil
cynric42,"Yeah, I ran out of steam while building a fuel power plant. Idk what it is with satisfactory, but the tediousness of building yet another factory just like the others but with more steps and bigger got me.

Maybe I’ll try again when it is finished and possibly has more story or better tools to keep me going."
GeePee29,Or me making a big plastic and rubber production plant and then finding I don't have enough power to run it.
Axquirix,Go hard drive hunting. Get Silicon Circuit Board and Silicon Computer. You can now do the whole thing with quartz and assemblers.

catatethebird,"Spent 8hrs the other day, used 3 pure iron nodes, one pure limestone, and one pure coal, to end up with one manufacturer shitting out 2 heavy frames a minute. Im trying not to just use other people’s designs, but there’s got to be a better way!  I’m thinking I should switch to making separate factories making basic parts, and have them all sent to a central manufacturer factory. I don’t know, this game drives me crazy trying to make the numbers add up."
majora11f,"You just need Oil, Crystals, Caterium, and copper. EZ. 

Real talk though, just take it one step at a time. How many computers do you want to make per minute? Now work backwards. How many of each part in the recipe do you need? etc. Do this till you get to the base ore and now you know how much you need to build. Leave space for expansion! Youll need it."
stonks_lol,"""Do it for her""

TrustedJoy,"Haha all the best!
I need to start my computer factory. I have it planned out just need to start building. I'm aiming to make 25 computers/min"
Saaihead,Computers are not too bad. Just you wait for them sweet Turbo Motors lol.
dusty101011,This is my reaction when my buddy has been working on a separate massive production line for the past 40 hrs of gameplay but didn’t use global grid to align our pieces.
Vexomous,Me after I finish my massive plastic/turbofuel factory when I realize it's just 20% of my supercomputer factory
Skullz64,"Solution: alternate recipe, I literally have computers assembled in the assembler"
Dianwei32,"Meanwhile, I'm planning a giant factory to make HMF, Computers, Encased Industrial Beams, and Motors (I still haven't automated them yet).

RLToro,"I just got to aluminum and I brought ore straight to the foundry. It turns out, there are more steps. I'm so mad about figuring it out logistically, that I've simply stopped playing for the time being."
finalizer0,"It's the planning stage that's getting me. Spent the past few days mapping out how to set up the southeast corner for synthetics, computers, HMFs, space elevator parts, and misc equipment and ammo. Not even in the game, just staring at a notepad and various wiki pages & the calc app planning the darn thing.

Kinda wish the calculator program had a system for optimizing a set of input resources instead of just assuming one recipe for everything, but gift horses and all that. At least I'm finally at the stage where I can start putting this monster factory together now!"
Pixelsock_,"I take it you are trying to unlock trains? Me too. I just built a motor factory so that I can build the stuff I need for HMF and computers. (Manufacturers, etc)"
vincent51797,96 hours and counting on a 9k mw coal plant ...I hate water
NightBeWheat55149,"I still remember trying to get fuel generators and thats when i realised how difficult computers and HMFs are to manufacture (power grid blew 4 times, restarted after update)"
W34kness,"Just a note, your screw production is currently falling behind and is affecting other facilities efficiency"
