classless_classic,"You mean to tell me, he lied?!??"
grrrfld,"If George Santos does not turn out to be a new Sacha Baron Cohen stunt in the end, I'll be SO disappointed."
edinwiddie,Correction; he totally denied it at first. Then faced with overwhelming video evidence said it was a one time thing. It’s hard to keep up with all his falsehoods. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna66414
ImLikeReallySmart,But he hasn't yet blown the GOP's cover on its hookers and blow parties so they're still cool with him.
007meow,"Let’s make it clear - liberals and the Left don’t suddenly like him because he did drag, despite what conservatives try to push. Nor do they hate him for doing drag. 

He is getting hate for LYING about it, like everything else, while aligning himself with the alt-right."
Zbignich,"I never did it. 

If I did it, it was only once, just for fun. 

If I did it once, I might have done it more than once."
MadAstrid,Who among us hasn’t had a Mardi gras that lasted more than a thousand days?
barenaked_nudity,"It’s not what he lied about - it’s THAT he lied, and that he allies himself with those who would punish people with colorful lifestyles."
hdiggyh,Honestly I couldn’t care less what this guy does. The problem is he and his party made this into some giant thing and have literally made it a pillar of their culture war. Almost like everything else they are against but also partake in. What a turd
ohioismyhome1994,The documentary about this guy is going to be wild.
meem09,This dude has to be some sort of plant or for a film project or a prank gone wrong. There's no way this is an actual person.
keeping_the_piece,Poor drag queens. They've been falsely accused of being groomers a lot in the  past year but now they have to be associated with liar George Santos.
Extra-Ad5925,Someone else mentioned this on one of the many many previous stories…. But loving the strategy of asking him for comments and then showing all the evidence after he’s already made up something insane.
ImNickValentine,Is he mentally ill?  Not even joking.
sik_dik,"considering how much republicans hate drag queen story hour, they sure do seem to have no problem covering for a story-telling drag queen"
craig1f,"I feel like Republicans are using this Santos thing to their advantage. They are allowing Santos to become a lightning rod for the entire GOP. We are so focused on him, that all the other dirtbags in that party are being ignored."
Tony_Stark_0,"# WHY THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THIS PATHOLOGICAL LIAR STILL BEING ALLOWED TO HOLD PUBLIC OFFICE?

Someone **explain this shit to me!**

REPUBLICANS, I blame YOU for this. YOU created the atmosphere where someone like this can not only run for office, *but get elected.*

FIX YOUR SHIT, REPUBLICANS."
underwhelmer,"Liar who lied, lied about his lies."
Ixneigh,I’m going to run for conservative political office and just lie about my furry art and say it was a one time thing.
Divio42,"Unless he is either forced to resign without benefits or charged with a crime, this jackoff is winning via the Trump strategy just by keeping his name in the headlines.

There is no reason for his name to appear 4 times on the first page of /new here as of the time of writing this."
gandiesel,Pretty uncharacteristic that he’d lie about it
Noblesseux,"I've got to be honest: as much as the asshole *really* needs to go, it is absolutely hilarious watching basically everything he says immediately get slapped down by people pulling the receipts."
prescience6631,"George Santos is ‘Catch Me if You Can’ but stupid, caught within 5 minutes and without any of the intrigue"
llyrPARRI,Drip feeding evidence so that the liar can keep embarrassing himself is the absolute best way of doing this.
syrstorm,And lets be clear - being a drag queen? That's pretty cool. Lying about it like an asshole to get power? That's bad.
wired1984,This story keeps getting more confusing
TransgenderedPanda,"Honestly, this guy’s life seems pretty weird and awesome. If you made a movie about it, nobody would believe it. 

(please, someone make that film)"
rredline,Remember when a major political candidate’s career was ended because he “yee-hawed” too enthusiastically at a political rally? Pepperidge Farms remembers.
FortunateInsanity,"After learning he said it was a “one-off”, my immediate reaction was to think he probably has a scheduled drag performance lined up for later that day."
TheKindaMan,Interesting it went from “that never happened at all they’re lying” to “okay is was a one off”. Pathological liars gonna lie
picklestixatix,One-offish.
FuckingShitRobots,The fact that he hasn’t been removed is a devastating condemnation of just how shitty this country is. Everything is a goddamn joke.
WilHunting2,"Genuine Question:

Do we know for sure he isn’t currently in drag posing as a man in Congress?

At this point we don’t even know his  actual name, nationality, or where he is a citizen. Would it surprise anyone if Santos is a woman?"
Girlindaytona,"So he is a crossdresser. So what. We know he’s gay. That doesn’t bother me and it shouldn’t be the emphasis in the press. It’s the lying and campaign finance issues that we should be addressing. You would be surprised how many men crossdress or wish they could. It is uncommon but not abnormal. Then again, neither is a Republican politician who lies."
dawgblogit,"George Santos responses to questions from a reporter:

Did I say one night?  What I meant to say it was a series of one nights over a 3 year period to 10 year period?  

No I am not wearing a dress.   Why do you ask?  This is just a very long shirt that ends at the floor. 

Men can wear makeup too.  All the tv personalities do it.  Don't judge me.  

Oh these?  I know they look like it but they aren't high heels.  Much like Tom Cruise I use shoes to give me extra height.

So what if my chapstick is from MAC they have all the best colors I mean flavors I mean... next question.

Why yes that is ABBA playing in the background.. 

Oh my hair?  Oh this is just a wig I tried on.. I was thinking what I would look like if I had longer hair as a man totally not as a guy dressed as a woman answering questions from a reporter."
Ok-Hunt6574,How did he do that while landing on the moon?
Junior_Pizza_7212,"This guy is gonna crack soon, he was not prepared at all for all this to come out the way it has. I just don’t understand how his opposition didn’t find all of this out sooner?"
_wisky_tango_foxtrot,Where the hell was the opposition research into this asshole when he was running? This seat should have been a slam dunk for the Democrats!
AThreeDollarBill,"First it wasn’t him, and then it was a one-off, and then he was pretty much a career drag queen? Am I keeping up?"
XueShiLong,"never thought I'd see the day when an elected politician would like more consistently and absurdly than DJT, yet here we are, with an even more ridiculous lying bozo."
DogMilkBB,"I don't care about the drag, just that he is a lying liar. Not fit for office clearly."
omniumoptimus,"A couple of decades ago, news media would do this to criminalize homosexuality. Sensational headlines SUGGESTING being gay and wrongdoing were equivalent or working hand-in-hand. 

If transsexual behavior is ok, let it be ok. If it’s not a big deal, let it be not a big deal. If it’s not a problem, let it be not a problem. 

If you despise George Santos, there are many many things you can point to in support of your feelings. We don’t absolutely, necessarily, have to make it harder for transsexual persons in the process."
,"But to be fair, who among us can't say... they've partied in drag over the last 3 years? Quarantine had us all acting fools. Am I right? *looks around nervously*"
NIN-pig,"I wanna be a politician…

Drag shows, hookers, cocaine, political conspiracies and cover ups all sound delightfully fun 🤩"
TaiFuzzle,George Santos: The gift that keeps on giving!!
bluelifesacrifice,"He's getting dragged about lying, not dressing up.

Conservative PR are going to spin this."
JustYerAverage,"Maybe we can just get this guy to give us a list of things he ""hasn't"" done."
Pointlessname123321,"I don't understand how none this never made it to voters. I get not catching every lie when the only thing I'm sure Santos hasn't lied about is being born, but how had none of this made it into an attack ad or local news outlet?"
autotldr,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.businessinsider.com/videos-george-santos-drag-kitara-ravache-over-period-3-years-2023-1) reduced by 84%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> Recently surfaced videos seem to suggest that Santos dressed as his drag persona over a period of at least three years, casting doubt on his claim that it was a one-off occurrence.

> Santos initially denied the allegation of being a drag queen, writing on Twitter: &quot;The most recent obsession from the media claiming that I am a drag Queen or &#039;performed&#039; as a drag Queen is categorically false.""

> Videos and photos, spanning from 2005 to 2008, indicate that Santos may have been dressing in drag at events for several years, despite his denial that he was ever a drag queen.

CuriousHeffa,Who's keeping records with Pinocchio here? He must be past 600 lies by now.
Acrobatic_Bison_914,I feel like Ashton Kutcher is behind this…
tenghu,*One-off?* I thought he said it wasn’t true …
Returd4,The fact he was in drag is not important to me. The fact his a hypocritical bigot matters
cjthomp,"> ""Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me"""
Squidwards-the-goat,"So are all these conservatives that show up at places where they have drag queen story hour, going to protest Santos? Or is it OK because he has an R by his name?"
50clicks,Just a “less closeted” republican
Behind8Proxies,"Gee. I hope no children saw his drag show. 

Please think of the children."
alexbeeee,Lmao just cop to it already bro! They figured you out!
QuitYour,The real reason surfaces why the republicans are turning on him.
TroppoAlto,The drag part doesn't matter. He's a liar and a fraud. The GOP needs to kick him out.
7fw,"I hate that we have to use this part of his life to ""shame"" him out of office. He is so unqualified for office it's horrendous he even got in. We should be able to get him out based on those lack of being qualified. His being a drag queen should have no baring on his being in Congress, or his ability to govern. And rather than saying ""Ha! You look great! Good for you!"" we have to poke and prod and make him feel shame for it and make his party fuck him over for it. 

I hate American politics."
Wizywig,"Hey is that you in drag?

Nope, I don't do drag.

Hey! That's you in drag!

Okay... you got me, it was that ONE TIME. Don't read too much into it.

You partied in drag for years!

Okay okay okay it was for years, but it was a very fabulous time in my life, and I am different now.

You're currently in drag!

Okay look, we're in an open carry state, and I don't see you donating to my favorite animal shelter..."
gentlyredundant,">spread claim

>wait for the subject to deny said claim

>release iron-clad evidence

Love to see it."
Truffans,Is George even Tony’s real name?
LegalBrandHats,Ok but seriously who gives a fuck if he did drag. The Lies on his resume about his qualifier should be a bigger deal.
ErusTenebre,"I feel like we need to stop with the news of all the lies he tells and maybe switch to itemizing the truths he's told.

Might make less headlines.

Probably not any...

Dude is basically what happens when lies are embodied. Like seriously, he might beat Trump's record in a quarter of the time."
Palestbycomparisoned,It’s amazing they immediately have proof he is lying almost every time he is questioned. It’s like watching a trial with Alex jones when he is shown evidence over and over after each question and he doesn’t learn to just come clean.
GrnYellowBird,"No one cares that he did it. We cared that he lied and had no integrity, and works for a party that wants to send us back to the Stone Age"
ResponsibilityDue448,"Santos “Drag is wrong.”

Reality “You’ve cross dressed.”

Santos “It was one-off.”

Reality “You did it multiple times over three years.”

Santos “Cross dressing isn’t drag.”

Reality “😐”"
Inverno969,Are they suggesting he lied again? Who would have thought!
Steve0mac,"How did any of this not come out during election?

Whoever's job it was to find this out for the opposing candidate should be fired."
FlyingRhenquest,"Is this guy even a US citizen? I'm guessing no one checked that. He's from Brazil and has multiple aliases. Based on what we know about him, it seems like he's only here to take advantage of this country and its citizens. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear that George Santos is a stolen identity at this point. Did the New York Republicans make their base vote for an illegal alien?"
letscallitanight,I wonder if he partied with Rudy https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-stuck-his-face-in-rudy-guilianis-chest-in-2000-drag-comedy-skit-2018-5
mattthewj,"Where did the republicans find this guy?  Also, how did his democrat opponent not catch on to all these lies.  Sums up our system pretty well."
Icommentor,"I'm sure he can figure out a really entertaining answer. ""I momentarily switched faces with a friend, through a simple procedure. Turns out my friend used my face to dress in drags. I was only using my friend's face to defraud a dude a second time.""

""The Jewish space lasers do not only start forest fires in California; they can also project holographic images to spread falsehoods. I'm Jewish so I approve of this, except when I'm not Jewish, which is the case at this very moment."""

Bluffy O' Guile"
BoringWozniak,At this point I’m expecting George Santos to never have existed at all and every photo of him is generated by an AI
Hav3_Y0u_M3t_T3d,"I'm so glad that he lied and denied this, otherwise I might actually have something to like about the snot nosed weazel"
blind99,"Caught in his lies again lol, color me surprised."
dragon123tt,"If it comes out thats hes killed someone, it would not surprise me"
BretonDude,"Guys, I think he might be a pathological liar."
BunkMoreland1414,Wait wait I never said I didn’t party in drag. I said I was never a drag on a party!
RellenD,I love how journalists do this. They had all this information. Let him lie and then released the information.
alktrio06,"According to the GOP, he’s a groomer, but they’ll do anything to maintain power."
shmoopiegroupie,Immigration fraud should be a sin for the GOP. He married a woman so she could get a green card and tried to get his boyfriend to accept his engagement while still married by just announcing it over and over despite the bf turning him down over and over.
Earth_Friendly-5892,So he actually represents the type of people that MAGA republicans despise and HATE?
luxtabula,"Can we take a step back for a second?

Why are we talking about this story? Oh, don't get me wrong, I think George Santos deserves every bit of criticism coming to him.

But let's think of the stuff he's being accused of. He has pretty credible alleged fraud charges. Why is this not being circulated more? Isn't it a little weird we're focusing on him dressing in drag, a victimless issue that's not a crime?

I thought more people in this subreddit were liberal. I don't get why this story is being highlighted so much."
Rocketboy1313,"Okay this is drifting into performance art.

Is he just an elaborate psy-op to really highlight the insane non-sense that is the Republican culture war?

Just tear away any pretext of them actually giving a fuck about things other than power for its own sake?"
ScholarZero,I would rather the headline start with the lie.  This sounds like the three years of drag is an issue.  It's not.  It's the fact that he said he did it once and was clearly lying about it.
hawkseye17,"Are you saying a pathological liar, lied? Preposterous!"
monkeyhold99,"So he’s a closeted cross dresser and/or trans?

The irony here is insane"
Nicktendo,He probably did it Friday night
BlackDiamondDee,Is MTG going to call him a groomer?
Shurae,Okay come on this guy must be planted by the DNC /s
MithranArkanere,11 out of every 10 things this guy says are lies.
CoffeeTwoSplenda,Whoa! He lied?
xReshi92,I just can’t believe he lied. He’s been so honest otherwise.
Bhimtu,"OH....so NOW it's a ""one-off"". Geezus, this dude is pathological."
branimal84,I'm starting to think this man doesn't even exist - that he is a concept made up by someone else.
PallandoOrome,Kick this grifting lying criminal in jail and out of public office immediately.
No_Association7140,This guy is fucking sick in the head. Serial liar.
LosBrad,"I don't give a hoot that he did it, the problem is that he lied.  Again."
VannKraken,"Good God, I hope he wasn't reading books to any Brazilian kids at any of those drag shows!"
SadisticSavior,He might actually lie more than Trump. And that's not a small accomplishment.
Important_Fruit,"Let me see if I have this right....

""George - did you perform in drag?"" 

""No.  Never.  It's a dirty lie made up for political mileage."" 

""Here's the video."" 

""OK, but it was just once.  Just once.""

""Here's the other videos..."""
Monkfich,"Apart from the fact this continues to show he is a lying pig, does anyone really care about the drag at all?"
DrPagliacci,"I'd be fine if we just dropped the drag stuff altogether, he lied about plenty else that we can talk about without the side effect of using a marginalized group for a political point."
Millia_,There has to be a subreddit or wiki page simply documenting his lies at this point. It's legitimately too hard to keep track without writing it all down.
iamfareel,"I would think conservatives would not like this. How do they feel that he was in drag, and especially multiple times? Do they want him out of office just like democrats?"
Mrmakanakai,At this point I'm just gonna bet George is really a female.
mynameisalso,No way George Santos is his real name.
conditerite,next it will turn out they've marketed a signature line of wigs for the past ten years. s/
ayleidanthropologist,"“It was 1-ish times, ok? Those 3 years were just like 1 big party.”"
efstajas,"At this point, I'm convinced that George Santos is a Banksy"
SporkOfThor,"Georgina Santos?

Honestly, we know LESS THAN NOTHING about this guy/gal."
rizorith,Is this clown capable of trying the truth? Sounds like he'll fit in fine with the GOP. Not surprises republicans in Congress are fine with him staying.
tribe573,"I think of this whenever I learn something new about Santos.

https://youtu.be/CRj61dcvmuU"
jewishseeker,"If he is a drag queen, that's wonderful. The problem is when he is and claims to be gay but uses his vote to harm the LGBTQ community and our interests."
flattop100,WTF is wrong with this guy? (not the drag - the lying)
AngryBudgie13,George Santos aka Anthony Devolder aka Kitara Ravache aka Anthony Zabrosky….won’t even be from the US or Brazil at this rate. He was probably born on another continent altogether in somewhere like Namibia or Tajikistan.
Llama-Ghost,EVERYTHING HE SAYS IS A LIE! How hard is this to understand? They should just keep a running list online instead of continuously reporting every lie.
GlobalPhreak,"Pretty sure by the time you establish your own drag queen name, you're well beyond a ""one off"".

I buy Rudy being a one off... not this guy...

https://youtu.be/spn0MJZr-QQ"
DogDickRedForman,The GOP is like Ace Ventura right now when he discovered that Finkle was Einhorn.
zipzzo,"I think it's hilarious how much lying this guy has been caught doing but a small part of me feels a little uncomfortable when the articles and stories are focused around his history as a drag queen.

Like...there's nothing wrong with drag queens? So a lot of these articles and some of the hubbub around the discovery of him having been one just feels a bit low-key bigoted to me? I know that people will say ""it's just the fact he lied about it"", and for many that's the case, but like, you know, some people might hide it because they recognize the societal implications (sadly, that's just how things are) or just plain don't want to be beat up by strangers or bigots.

There's plenty of other lies to hone in on, but this one just makes me feel weird. There are actual, verifiably good reasons to lie about this sort of thing depending on where you live, or who surrounds you or what community you live in, so it doesn't really strike as *that odd* that he'd want to keep it under the table.

Now, this doesn't excuse the other dumb ass lies he's been caught in, don't get me wrong, I just can't really ""join in the fun"" when the subject matter is focused on his history in drag."
1025Traveller,Surely George isn’t telling lies.
Every3Years,"Dude is incapable of being completely honest, it's so weird"
finitecapacity,Cannot wait for the impending biopic on this guy.
Kamarmarli,That’s the least disturbing thing about him.
GreatMadWombat,"The drag part isn't bad at all, but seriously, how the fuck did the Dems not do any opposition research on this dude whatsoever? There are so many gigantic spots where he's lying"
Mr-Brown-Stone,This guy is the GOP’s distraction so they can pivot on other controversies without anyone paying attention.
Song_Spiritual,"He put it on for three years, and only took it off once = one-off.

Q.E.Mfing.D."
WiseAlbatross9474,"Our first drag queen in congress, a republican. I wish we were that liberal."
imfreerightnow,"I love that this man is now tied exclusively to a party that will always and forever despise him and everything he is. I love that for him, I truly do."
shotgun_ninja,"This just keeps getting funnier.

It's not that he did drag. It's that, like everything else about him, this too was a lie."
