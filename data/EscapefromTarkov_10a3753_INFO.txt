{"Title": "If you're wondering how people are seeing at night without NVGs, read this.", "Post Text": "I mainly do night raids, and I'd say only 15% of PMCs i kill at night are actually wearing NVGs. I see this come up all the time in the sub, people complaining that they can't see, or wondering how in TF others are seeing at night. There are many solutions to this, including NVDIA control panel settings, in game post FX, but the least intrusive and best way I've found to see at night (or dark places like interchange) is through Windows \"Calibrate Display Color\"\n\n1.Type \"Gamma\" into your start bar.\n\n2. Open \"Calibrate Display Color\".\n\n3. Push \"next\" 3 times until you get to a slider.\n\n4. Crank the slider up to 80-90% then tab back into tarkov (don't go further into the menu).\n\n5. Leave it open in the background to make changes on the fly as needed. The window must remain on the same monitor you are gaming on. When done with Tarkov, simply close that window, and monitor will revert back to normal. This works for most monitors, but not all. For some people this will only \"wash out\" the picture, but it has worked for 80% of my friends. This will work on every map except factory- It's the only true dark map at night.\n\nHope this helps, see you in the shadows.\n\nEdit:\n\nNotice all the downvotes and butthurt from people who abuse this, but don't want you to know about it. These are the guys who are shooting you 20 feet away in the dark and you have no idea how they saw you sitting in the shadows.\n\nIt isn't a cheat, it's literally a windows monitor setting that every single person with windows has access to.\n\nUntil BSG finds a way around it, spreading the information only levels the playing field. It would be dope if everyone was forced to use flashlights/NVGs for night raids, but I'm not running NVGs when 85% of the lobby isn't.", "ID": "10a3753", "Score": 1118, "Total Comments": 491, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10a3753/if_youre_wondering_how_people_are_seeing_at_night/"}
