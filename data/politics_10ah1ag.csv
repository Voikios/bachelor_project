gogojack,"Friendly reminder:

After the 2016 election - where Trump claimed ""massive voter fraud"" led to him losing the popular vote - he empaneled a blue ribbon commission to root out all the ""massive voter fraud.""

Not long after, the ""we're totes gonna go after voter fraud"" panel quietly disbanded after finding (checks notes) nothing.

People who wanted very badly to find voter fraud found none.  This was a precursor to the ""Cyber Ninjas"" case here in AZ where a dedicated voter fraud conspiracy theorist got the legislature to spend millions of dollars to find...

My-Angry-Reddit,"Me and a republican acquaintance of mine got into an argument about election fraud. He was convinced democrats cheated. I gave up arguing with him and said, ""Well, if dems are so good at cheating, maybe you guys should cheat better."" 

The trap was set knowing goddamn well that if they attempted it, they would get caught.

This is how all Republicans think. They think we cheated, so they try to do what they're projecting thinking they're smarter than everyone else and they keep getting caught.

Dems aren't perfect by any stretch, but it's quite clear who the lesser of two evils are."
