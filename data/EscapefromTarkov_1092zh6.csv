El_Boojahideen,"‚ÄúAcquires top tier loot after multiple grueling raids‚Äù 
‚ÄúGets killed by a hacker the first time i bring it in to raid‚Äù"
JiffTheJester,Damn these guys really want top tier gear to be rare. If you run it you‚Äôre def getting killed by a hacker
Strawhead2077,Hopefully they will buff Loot again then. KIBA needs love
chinock,Guarantee it's all going to light keeper as an incentive to level him up but hardly anyone will have the time to max him especially with all the cheat kicking about lighthouse
EnrolledAgent,Do you guys have jobs? Why the hell are you 50 already?
katkitt,"You missed the one that will affect the average player the most which is by far the most braindead shit i've ever seen: 

Rat rigs from rag2 are now limited to 1 per reset... lmao."
vektorm8,"What if all of the stuff they're taking away is stuff that Lightkeeper is going to sell?

Personally, I think they are just trying to delay the wipe by taking away super high end stuff so the power levelling chads aren't constantly covered in late-game kit. At least yet. I was thinking they'll add this stuff back at the end, or were thinking we'll stockpile it anyways. That being said, the Lightkeeper theory kind of works there, too. Like he may be timegated and will bring all this gear in at a later date further in the wipe?"
Joeys2323,"Where is the tasmanian tiger? Is he safe, is he alright?"
bungothecat,It just makes no sense why they do this stuff during wipe and not make these changes before wipe.
roadtograndchampion,"Small brain thinking: 
Removing high pen ammunition and removing high tier armor to the same extend vanishes the fact of removing any high pen ammunition in the first place. It is now paca vs ps ammo instead of gzel vs bp ammo."
Ibrenecairo,this will make aidrops super attractive now which is cool
Newguyiswinning_,What? BSG nerfs casual players after streamers get to benefit? Never heard of that before
MrEmuu,"Whatever keeps this game from turning into the 762BP,m61,m62 GZHEL, ALYTN, Vudu, m856a1 thermal, hell of a game this game turns into within 2-3 months has my gratitude, so nice. About time lol"
NvIWraith,"makes sense, looks like they want the current ""mid level gear"" to be the new ""end game gear"" then have the endgame gear be in small quantities or a luxury.

I like this change personally."
Shawzus,These changes are moving in the right direction. Make the recoil a better system and it will be great.

Komacho,Literally killing progression desire for the average player lol
Zookzor,"Who cares, there‚Äôs no real reason to PvP anyways."
Fissure_211,"This is only my second wipe (first full wipe; I joined last wipe late, hit max traders, etc), and I can't help but get the feeling that this is why people no life/rush this game. 

People who are already at max traders, etc, have stockpiles of good ammo, armor, and weapons. Me, a guy who plays fairly regularly but didn't take off of work to no life the game the first week, is only at lvl 19 and has not had the chance to stockpile the best armor, weapons, and ammo before they were removed. 

These changes needed to happen at wipe so that they impacted everyone evenly. Changing the playing field post-wipe start has a disproportionate impact on segments of the playerbase. 

People who no life the game should get the best stuff faster, I have no issue with that, but letting them get it earlier and then changing the rules for everyone else is a shitry way to manage it."
EstablishmentCool197,"Mid wipe will last longer, I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs a bad thing"
FakeGarboMan,"reddit hivemind when bsg buffs chads: anger

reddit hivemind when bsg nerfs chads: anger"
Lazerhawk_x,Tbh just remove traders at this point- remove the flea market and lets just hit each other with axes and pm pistols.
ZeroTwo3,"I know my opinion literally doesn‚Äôt matter, but I‚Äôll give it anyways. I‚Äôve played this game since 2018, and it‚Äôs been getting steadily worse since. 

Making it so hard to even get to mid tier gear will almost assuredly kill my desire to play at all. I never had more fun than when I was walking around in full L6 and meta gear by just playing casually. I loved rocking a PACA, blue beret, and fully kitted SVD with SNB in Interchange, just fucking around. Night ops on Lighthouse in top-tier gear and a VSS made me fall in love all over again. T-Tiger and iron-sighted MP7? Fun on a budget. 

This? Hell nah. I‚Äôve gotten KAPPA before, I‚Äôve been L60 +. I‚Äôve extract camped, ratted, chadded, and played conservatively. My best friend and I bonded over this damn game. This is straight up pandering to those players with no situational awareness, who‚Äôs dog tags filled my cases in wipes past. It empowers the no-lifers and streamers, who we all can see have BSGs ear. It makes me, who doesn‚Äôt have time to spend on impermanent game progress, unable to win gunfights due to subpar gear. 

I just want to *play a game I paid for*. Sure, it‚Äôs entitled to change, but this is clearly being made in a direction contrary to what is healthy for me and others like me."
ChucklesAcademy,Im just slightly agitated as to how im going to get Gzhels for tasks now?
ChefCobra,"As long as I can get my ""Press"" armour, I am good."
thebski,"Every change like this further incentivizes hackers, gear fear, and avoidance of PvP. Everyone complains that the game used to be more fun because PvP was so fun but now everyone just wants to rat in a bush. Gee, I wonder why. Probably because back then you just went to the flea and bought the kit again. Now, the good stuff isn't just hard to get it, it simply can't be replaced without RNG."
StealthCatUK,"So we have gone being 2 or 3 shot to through level 6 armour with M62 or 762 BP to, 2 or 3 shot through level 4 armour with 762 PS, why?

It changes nothing gameplay wise. You still die in the same amount of time."
saiik,"F to the Rys, it was my favorite helmet"
Kavorg,"As a player who has played for over 5 years but much more casually these days, this change is phenomenal.

These recent changes are a culmination of years of dev blogs and players (not just the streamers that were invited to be on them) asking for these changes. 

These are good changes. üëç"
Huller_BRTD,"The complete removal from traders will just make it so that it'll only be used by turbosweats who farm rogues/raiders nonstop or spend the entire wipe locked up in an ammo box like all FiR only ammo. I do like the intent of the change but instead of flat our removal they should have restricted the amount you can buy so that you'd have to either stockpile or ration it per magazine (eg 20 PS 10 BP), especially if they added magazine presets at the same time. 

120 rounds of BP per reset resulted in people stockpiling more meta ammo than they could ever use so they decided to just run exclusively with full load outs of top tier ammo. If instead you could only buy twenty/thirty or so BP per reset you'd have to be a lot more frugal with how you spend them. 

Imo they should make most top tier ammo available to traders in small quantities per reset so that instead of running exclusively meta mutants we'd have the option to branch out into other weapons. Out of BP? Why not try the RPK with that 7n40 you have been stockpiling? Not in the mood for AKs? Give the 50 rounds of 9mm Pbp per reset a chance to shine."
ReflexSheep,"If this game is still in beta and testing phase, why lock so much content behind restrictions 90% players wont be able to get through?"
SeparateAddress9070,good. good. good.
_baundiesel_,I don't hate these changes but I do hate that Nikita made sure they didn't do it until all of his streamer buddies had Level 4 traders and had already stocked up.
artosispylon,"all these changes are useless until they at least try to crack down on cheating, the second you put on a t6 armor you will be murdered faster than if you used a paca due to cheaters comming right for you instead of ignoring you"
Chad_mcbooty,"All this changes are actually dumb, why focus so much on gun building and equipment while developing the game just to make everything flea and trader restricted. So much fun running around with shitty old guns."
riceputting123,Lmao idk what we expected. BSG made a good game and is just slowly murding via death by thousand cuts
aidanmanman,My input on the situation might sound crazy to some people. I don‚Äôt like removal of good ammo besides BP no needs to go but the way I look at the game is that the streamers and no lifers will always have good ammo but removal from traders makes it worse for casual players since they don‚Äôt have time to farm rouges bosses or raiders for good ammo while the no lifers can spend a day farming and fill boxes with great ammo you may disagree but this is my opinion
snorinsonoran,Finally
braxton3451,"With the massive performance hit I've taken across all maps and the fact that standard Account has gotten fucked AGAIN. I'm finally doing it, I'm done with tarkov. The devs actually straight up ignore any feedback and usually do the opposite. Band aid fixes for band aid fixes for shit that's fundamentally broken."
Ok-Life8294,"All these changes are going to make cheating and group play skyrocket in the game. Then the game will turn into every other similar game.

The best thing about Tarkov that I always felt was great was that money was easily obtainable and the best gear wasn't ungodly expensive. It's all accessible by everyone. But why would anyone bring good gear out solo now? The harder the game gets the more people will cheat, which in turn will create more cheaters or lower the player base. The cheating problem is already the worst I've ever seen it.

I get that they want to prolong the early game and have people suffer. But this game is turning into a masochistic pain simulator devoid of any of the fun aspects of the game.

I'm just not gonna play if I can't play the main core of the game, the end game pvp."
WowWhatABillyBadass,"I used to laugh at all the ""balance changes"" BSG did, even though the game itself is broken and unfinished in nearly every aspect.

Now it's just sad. How long was the game in Alpha, and how long has it been in ""beta""? Is the game ""feature complete""? Does audio work yet? Is desync improved? Are the hackers gone? How many times have you done the gold pocketwatch quest?"
Ruin4r,"Another change that highlights the need for more loyalty levels on traders. 

Having more loyalty levels would help keep progression feeling rewarding and split up the thousands of items in game."
methrik,I‚Äôm a disgusting little rat fuck that just sits in a corner with a shotty and maybe sometimes throw on armor from my last scav run. This is good for me lol
DreamDisharmony,"For me, a player who can only play a few raids a night these changes make it so I won‚Äôt quit the game in a week. Because before I could never keep up and it‚Äôs not fun playing where every raid is some super chad with high tier body armor and ammo while I‚Äôm stuck with tier 4 at best and middle ground ammo. Now I‚Äôll be able to stand a chance since gear and ammo will be rarer."
Cheiff117,BSG removing meta üòÇ rhs-T is dumb that they removed ammo fine I get it honestly but helmets and armours  that are locked till lvl 40 where half the community can‚Äôt even get past 20 üòÇüòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è going downhilll
superorignalusername,Soon the paca will be a lvl 4 ragman buy
Sanagost,"Good. Let the end game be the end game, with the highest stakes. You are the best protected, but if you lose, you lose big and have to find your way back."
intermediatehatred,"Lol all those YouTube channels living off speculation... ""They said trader changes, it will be traders in games possibly"" with way higher hype than ""possibly'"" warrants.

There you go, real changes."
sanctionTheOrcs,"So this really is happening, nikita is doing what he said long time ago."
Reven-,I don‚Äôt mind this.
WhtLtg,Helmets are fucking useless anyways. I haven't run a helmet all wipe. 52% survival rate 41 PMCs killed
Sazbadashie,Oh and you can't wear headphones with the ssh steel helmet anymore  and I'm okay with the Altyn going personally the rest seem a little weird but I can understand that one choice  the other ones sound like a Chad problem I'm to rat to understand
kyoLZC,"Good changes, but it wont work unless cheats are purged from the game lmao..

can alr imagine sites going : Â°îÂÖãÂ§´Êñ∞ÊâãÁ§ºÂåÖ +Ëá™ÁûÑ+ÈîÅÂ§¥ = 150 RMB"
ItsAxeRDT,Why is BSG favoring cheaters so much rn? Unless they have some heavily good anti-cheat changes along the way as well as a large cheater wave this will just do more harm than good
Comprehensive_Fee_23,Don't you all say that early wipe is the best time because everyone is running around in paca's and dick helmets with trash guns? There you go
VonComet,"imagine the shakes you will get now when you drop a chad with ULTRA rare loot, it's gonna be more rare but more fun"
Khryn_Tzu-TTV,"I don't mind having to find gear in the LOOTER SURVIVAL game.    


You were a target already if you wear good stuff in raid for cheaters, now you aren't going to last one minute.  This should be fascinating to watch these streamers that are high level already get run down over and over by cheaters."
ReformedLifter,good now u can just get killed by the cheaters with 1 bullet instead of tanking 20 of em poggers good job bsg
Nationxx,"I‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôm not playing this wipe, the new changes sound so shitty.."
internetguy789,I cannot believe the stupidity in this sub üòÇ. Buffs hackers and RMTers. The trade for Ghzel is still absolutely dirt cheap for no lifers. People saying this is good are the seals getting clubbed on labs.
ForEveryHour,"*This is such a great change, it only extends the life of the wipe!*

Yeah, incentivizing cheaters even further when they are already at their pinnacle in this game is a great idea for retaining players. Great fucking idea.

Why should anyone be rewarded with good equipment through questing or PVP, loot-vacuum rage hackers need to eat too! 

Thousands of hours in, but still don't like it?
**git gud SCRUB**"
Ok_Part_2747,"I found Rys in tech bins, stashes and green crates. 

I love these changes. Sucks because the wipe already happened. But this game is at its best when good gear is truly rare. The next wipe should be more gritty and back to basics. They are compressing the content and that needs to happen. If you didn‚Äôt play in the early days you wouldn‚Äôt understand. I think the new features mixed with the old grind would make this game as good as it once was. Read the lore of this game and it will make sense. It‚Äôs not supposed to be a super trooper sim. You‚Äôre stranded in a post war city. Resources are scarce. They have gone off course in the last few years so seeing these changes is phenomenal. Can‚Äôt wait for more restriction tbh. Tired of the fresh wipe feeling only lasting a few weeks because people can power through it with rubble grinding and buying the best gear.. hide everything behind stuff you have to find in raid and limit it."
Commercial-Low351,"skill issue, game is going in a direction where GOOD GEAR IS ACTUALLY RARE. like it or not thats the game we play its not intended to be a game where everyone has the best shit. Game is designed to be time consuming and punishing. id suggest call of duty or roblox if you want a more casual experience. Also Arenas will probably cater to casual players as well."
momentslove,"Not that matters but this wipe breaks my limits and it's time to say enough for me. BSG expects every player to be playing a hundred hours per week to be able to enjoy the game and unfortunately, I'm not one of them."
DickeTitten69,This wipe is shaping up to have the highest escape rate of all time. Plenty of other games in the sea. Nothing quite scratches the itch of Tarkov unfortunately though.
Donsen420,"So far this Wipe all BSG has done is getting the RMT prices up , with these changes i am sure i'll drive a Hellcat or AMG Blackbird like Niki in no time."
AverageMetalConsumer,"Cool so the only people that will have good gear will be the hackers, just how bsg intended."
OGlettuceWEED,It's like they actively try to make the game less fun every wipe I swear to God
Adony_,"Bsg in meetings figuring out ""how can we increase the time between raids, while also rewarding cheaters in game"" and struck gold with the armour removal."
aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,"FUCK, I hope the RMT guys enjoy the game when we're gone."
DorimeDoge890,"This is the worst dude, Tarkov has been going downhill since the loot restrictions happened."
,this literally just buffs hackers and nerfs legit players
FilthyPeasant_Red,Level 5 armor is end-game and is so good honestly I see no problem with this.
beonik,Good
storage_god,Dogsht change
SweetyMcQ,"So basically T4 is now endgame. They are literally slicing off hours of gameplay from Tarkov by removing this stuff. As soon as you get T4 thats it you basically made it, you win. The meta ammo, scopes, and chad armor/helms will be far to rare to routinely run for the vast majority of players.

In all my years of playing Tarkov I can confidently say that FIR Altyn/Rhys is very rare. So are their faceplates. Vulkans used to be reasonable to get from a raid when lab raiders wore them but now that all raider loot is absolutely dog shit and pathetic as fuck so I havent seen one in many wipes. I play a fuckload too. Routinely end up in mid/high 60s with Kappa."
ranopan0,"they are actually braindead, why the fuck dont they announce stuff like this before wipe? if you are making flea useless and doing quests useless on top of it, might let people know beforehand ?"
-Shaskis-,"Dope, so all the hackers can have the good gear and we are stuck with dicks in hand good job BSG."
dannybates,"Called it yesterday, Thankfully I managed to stock up roughly 20 Altyns/RysTs"
paulmonterro,"I thought people were crying chards have huge advantages and now they deleted a few options for no-lifers. So it will equal the playground. Are we still mad? 
Oh yeah, this is Reddit after all."
ShiddyWidow,I‚Äôm convinced they are trying to kill the game at this point
SideHug,Something else absolutely nobody asked for
Joeys2323,Now this is dumb. I could probably count on one hand how many altyns I saw last wipe
allbusiness512,"Yeah I've got a big stock, and Altyns can be found in raid at least so to some degree it makes sense (stashes/raiders/etc.)

But literally the deleting of the Rys-T makes zero sense. You actually cannot find it in raid, ever. They also just deleted the Vulkan barter and literally no one uses that shit."
itz_ayz,"Thank god i never used mine, now i will destroy all streamers with high tier rigs üòà"

BooBs_In_My_Inbox,"Is this cheater bait or something? 

How is taking access from good armor helping the average player? 
Seems like all this accomplishes is widening the gap between the haves and the have nots."
BeefyZealot,"They are giving up. They‚Äôre killing everything off, making it super grindy and boring and will fully release the game this year."
DontBelieveTheirHype,"I'm just over here losing my mind at this dude level 50 with all this loot barely two weeks into wipe, like holy shit how many hours did you put in this wipe my guy???"
Chris_Cobi,Looter shooter?  more like shooter with shit audio
Wrangler_Positive,"Awesome, meta stuff should be rare and hard to obtain. Makes the experience of finding it or killing a geared chad all that much more satisfying."
CachimanRD,im liking these changes more and more
Soulcaller,"man, just delete the whole game now, BSG clowns... now you can run around with mosin and diper gear until lvl40 what an experience D:"
JPence14,"Players: ""We want the early/mid wipe curve to last for longer""

BSG: ""Okay, done""

Players ""WTF, I can't get to the late wipe curve mere weeks after the wipe. Fuck you BSG!""

GibFreelo,All good changes. I'm level 6 running trash gear and got burned down by a kitted out level 40 dude last night who was exit camping on Customs. Diaper rags and dick helms sound good to me.
Tatersaladftw,"Doesn‚Äôt even matter. I‚Äôm
Already getting dusted by dudes level 50 with access to everything"
bass_voyeur,"I think BSG should just restrict gear by time, and make gear available in grouped tiers - a la arms shipments arriving to Tarkov. For example, tier 2 gear might become available after 1 month, tier 3 gear available after 1 month, tier 4 gear after 1 month... and so on. Quest rewards unlock better gear within that tier, but nothing from any subsequent tiers (which maybe only comes from bosses, rogues, etc.). We literally have the lore in the game that these Traders are getting gear from outside sources. So why not mirror that on the BSG side so that gear is restricted for the wipe season?"
CrashnBash666,"Well, guess I'm done with tarkov. BSG has proven they don't care about hackers, and why would they, it's a steady income source. But with all these changes I see no reason to continue through yet another wipe of the same shit."
stindog123,"they also moved fucking fs switchblade to ragman 3, honestly so annoyed with this game at this point"
LocusShadow,"Sweet, hope they stay in this direction"
,[deleted]
CatLooksAtJupiter,"I have literally never bought armor or helmets from traders. Maybe a few uley trades. I either find armor in raid and use it or don't bring armor and kill someone with it. That said, I have armor lvl 4+ on 90% of raids. 

Don't understand the people who just buy everything. Like, are we playing the same game?"
