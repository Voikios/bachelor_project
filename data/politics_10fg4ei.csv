**Tl;DR** This entire law is just a farce meant to prevent teachers from suggesting to students that prejudice is alive and well today. It also outright bans discussing affirmative action without saying that outright.There's an element of ""muh bootstraps"" in there too so that the right can continue to implicitly suggest disadvantaged people are just lazy.  

P.S. I would urge you to focus on preventing Ron Desantis specifically from having a rise to power now and let this shitlord get too much momentum. it's beyond clear he's the next ""chosen one"" Those migrant planes across state lines were a literal federal crime.

AskJayce,"You know, I thought I couldn't find a more despicable, Ivy League-educated, bad faith-acting politician who *pretends* to be an idiot than Ted Cruz. And then I learned about Ron DeSantis.

He very likely knows that he mostly tackles strawmans, but accuracy and actual *governing* isn't the goal; it's to pander to his base supporters. And they, for some fucking stupid reason, reaaaaaallly care about the culture war stuff instead of the insurance crisis and climate change crisis that is wrecking their state, so he's capitalizing on it."

Anyone saying that the US does not need to confront systemic racism or that it does not exist is either lying or willfully ignorant. Attacks like this on education are an attempt to cling to control. There is a reason Red strongholds have a tendency to have under funded education systems."
SpartanKane,">in the future, should College Board be willing to come back to the table with *lawful, historically accurate content*, FDOE will always be willing to reopen the discussion.

They mean history that doesnt deviate from the narrative that racism wasnt that bad in those days.

I **fucking** hate how they now want to rewrite history to serve their own sensitivities. Prejudice was and STILL is a thing. Own it and be better than it. What a joke. 

I think i need to take a break from news. This shit makes my blood boil."
quest-to-know,Ron DeSantis hates freedom.
jagdedge123,That's what a dictatorship looks like.
DuncanYoudaho,"I don't know how you can claim this is anything other than racist.

You know why we have African American Studies and Womens Studies and History of Feminism instead of just ""History""? 

Because crusty white guys didn't like having to care about anyone but themselves, so these Studies departments had to find other homes. It's a stubborn and bigoted refusal to change."
TintedApostle,"So Florida students will be unable to compete in colleges.  Advanced Placement courses get college credits for students.

throwmeawaypoopy,"One of the best courses I took in college, many moons ago, was something to the effect of ""American History from the Black Perspective.""

One of the most important educational events I ever had happened in that class. The professor asked what the cash crops of the South were. I answered ""Tobacco and cotton.""

We then spent the next 45 minutes discussing why my answer was wrong. Turns out there was a third cash crop:

Human children. The most important resource a plantation could grow was more slaves. 

Education matters"

zdvet,"I... ugh. 

This is for an AP class - which is not a required class. If a student wants to take the class, then who is he to say no. That should be up to the student and parents at that point.

DeweyCoxsPetGiraffe,‘Party of small government’
maxfieldd,"It’s exhausting reading about all this stupidity on the right currently. It feels inevitable and impenetrable. George Santos lied about nearly everything to get elected - give that man a committee seat. MTG might be involved in the attack on our capital - homeland security for her. DeSantis knows this is dumb, but he also knows that the idiots that make up his audience will eat it up. 

It’s so sad watching our country burn at the hands of a shrinking majority bent on ruining it for everyone before they leave. Bad Luhrmann said:

“Accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old, and when you do you’ll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders”

It feels different now. Everyone is a sociopath."

I don't understand why he alone knows what is ""historically accurate""."

MoveMitchGetOutDaWay,Even more of that “~~small government~~ smol dick energy” at work.
Flimsy-Statistician3,It’s literally an anti black law. Anti crt is just anti black.
Mr-Klaus,"Notice how they keep on taking their censoring and banning efforts to higher and worse extremes if no one stops them.

These ""anti-CRT"" bullshit laws were meant to only apply to younger kids, because they were ""protecting kids"". The it went to all kids no matter the age. Then they started doing the same to adult libraries by banning all kinds of books they disagree with and getting librarians who disagreed with them fired.

As we stand right now, it is illegal to teach any student anything to do with LGBTQ and/or racial history. They've even gone a step further and banned any speech that has anything to do with LGBTQ on school grounds.

They are literally policing what people can and cannot say.

Remember this is the party that keeps saying the Left wants to ban and censor everything, and using that as a rally to get people to vote for the Right. 

Looks to me like they're working under the idea that it's cool to censor and ban anything they don't like - but if people try to do the same thing to shit that they like, all over sudden you're violating their rights and that is against the constitution."
Gold_Biscotti4870,"He is the primary example of why we should not have a two-party system in this country. 

""It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, and foments occasionally riots and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which finds access to the government itself through the channels of party passions"". Thus, the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.

In short, we get crazy when we stop considering one's actions based solely on party affiliation. It is the lazy person's way of considering the destiny of this country."
TheBatemanFlex,This is pretty insane. Systemic Discrimination is a HUGE topic in economics these days. Right now it seems like he will block anything that implies the country has institutions that are fundamentally discriminatory. Will he begin to block research from universities in this area of study? Florida once had some powerhouses in economics.

ghandi3737,Can't wait to see the lawyers try to explain what CRT is and also to try and spin how it's bad to learn.
Dogstarman1974,They don’t want to teach history because their white children will or might FEEL bad.  The fuck your feelings party have pretty sensitive feelers.
Trixie6102,"As a woman living in Florida (ugh), pregnant with a bi-racial child, I am so very frightened for our future."

ShrapnelCookieTooth,He’s a favorite among Conservatives for a reason. Giving them all the hate they can handle and they’re loving it.
Important_Sound5151,"This should be a violation of the First Amendment. We are joking about a deadly situation which can have serious consequences for the future.  Those who really love their country must do everything in their power (legally) to reign  in these lunatics who are destined to take us back to the darkest part of our history. That’s why every Americans must read and understand their history. The notion that hiding the evils of the America’s  past will make the generations of the oppressors  feel good about themselves while the generations of the oppressed continue to experience such evils is a recipe for disaster. Deception and lies have never won but always come to a time of reckoning. Politicians can distort, hide, prohibit or suppress the authenticity of history, but only a simpleton would do  so such nonsense. The only redemption we have is a true version of our history that is accessible to schools, colleges, libraries that is appropriate to each age-group. If country or person does not come to term with the past, there cannot be a conciliation, and only then will understanding and forgiveness  can become a reality. 
Therefore, these politicians, who seek to maintain the status quo of “superiority” by putting  one race over another race(s)and  disguising their supremacy intent, in the name of their states, through laws or intimidation must be rejected and shun."

PowerAlwaysReveals,"For anyone who might be inclined to buy into the idea that courses like this are basically just dolled-up indoctrination seminars, the reality is both more interesting and more benign. 

The point of courses like this is to examine/analyze history and art/culture through a particular ‘lens.’ Familiar subject matter; less familiar context.

During my brief-ish stint as a college English major way back when, I came to know Shakespeare’s *Macbeth* like the back of my hand. Not because I particularly liked it—kind of a snoozer compared to *Othello,* honestly—but because no fewer than three goddamned courses in the space of two years had it on the reading list. The first being a ‘Survey of British Literature’ class, followed by a course that was exclusively Shakespeare, and finally a Gothic literature-focused class, where it was presented alongside, among other things, Bram Stoker’s *Dracula.*"
