Satisfactory"
houghi,I am afraid for you when you realize how much time you can spend on making things look nice.
elitebronze,"It looks good, very good. But pipes should go before belts, because of physics."
S1a3h,horizontal to vertical is the best pipe mode

Oh, wait...."
Mr_Zobm,reject nice and clean. embrace spaghetti
FractalJaguar,"I spend hours, sometimes, just building and rebuilding and working out the placement of buildings in order to get that kind of neatness!"
The_WolfieOne,"My first full play through to learn the game is a glorious mish mash of various sites purpose built that tend to be a spaghetti of belts and pipes and power lines.
I’ve gone back and restructured some sites as I improve building techniques - all in all pretty organic so far. I’ll save it and come back to it in a year

Likely restart before long and take what I’ve learned with an eye to this type of symmetry - my large scale coal power plants are symmetrical and neatly routed.
I prefer this neatness."
HoboSuperstar,I wish they make it a bit easier to build
