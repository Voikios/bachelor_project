TheSneakySneaks,Werewolf: The Apocalypse. Bought it for $70 when I first got my ps5 and I hated every moment of the 45 minutes I played.
Nomadic_View,"Biomutant

I bought it on launch day.  I got around to beating the story yesterday.  Kinda made myself finish it.  I didn‚Äôt have anything else that i was really interested in playing and figured I‚Äôd knock this one out.  It‚Äôs not the worst game ever, but it is repetitive as fuck.

It‚Äôs like a mix between fallout and teletubies.  Everything is dark, gloomy, and covered in waste.  But the dialogue is always something like ‚ÄúGo to the fuzzy fields and get the tinkerturner.  But watch out for puffy-floos and their gurgerly-goos.‚Äù"
not_an_mistake,Rocket league 3 days before it went to free to play
ElasticBiscuit,Battlefield 2042. Gold version.
seita2905,Anthem
Henchman4Hire,"Spider-Man 3 on the Playstation 2. 

Remember the amazing joy of playing Spider-Man 2? The web-swinging, the fully realized Manhattan? It is one of the greatest superhero video games ever made, especially at that time. So when the next movie came out, complete with another game adaptation, I was beyond excited. So much so that I went out on my lunch break to the next town over just to own the game as early as possible. I couldn't wait until after work to get it. 

Turns out Spider-Man 3 was made for the Playstation 3, and the PS2 version was a steaming pile of hot shit. The graphics, gameplay, game world were all leagues worse than in Spider-Man 2. This thing was a monstrosity and the memory of my foolish hope has been burned into my soul."
cabalavatar,"Worst one for me was Thief 2013. I almost always wait, but the PS4 didn't have a lot of games, and I love games that emphasize stealth. But the game lacked polish and too inconsistently had enemies spot you in areas where they shouldn't be able to."
spageddy_lee,Aero the Acro-bat for Super Nintendo.
Inefficacy,"Battlefield 2042, I still feel like such an idiot"
SweetPuffDaddy,"Gotham Knights. Played maybe 6 hours before uninstalling it. The game came out 3 months ago, and it‚Äôs currently on sale 50% off. That tells you everything you need to know"
applecideriswet,Anthem deluxe and fallout 76 collectors edition
SHARNTROY,"I‚Äôm pretty sure there is a whole subreddit called Madden for this question‚Ä¶.  Those guys are like a broken record 

They would be like
Madden 23
Madden 22
Madden 21‚Ä¶.

Yet they purchase the game every year"
ToxicSplash,"Just Cause 4, pre odered the Gold Edition for 100‚Ç¨ because I was a long standing fan of the series and the trailers all looked really good so I got really hyped for it.. well it was alright at some parts, graphics, story and gameplay were awful, but the sandbox open world was pretty decent."
arealdoctor25,Falllout 76.    What a load of trash at launch that game was
AllInHarry,"WatchDogs Legion 

Don‚Äôt buy a game just cos you think it‚Äôll be cool driving round a city in the country you live in lol"
Z_M_P_Y,"The rainbow six siege year 7 pass, mainly because I stopped playing after season 1"
cameronfremont,Pretty sure Playstation issued a refund to everyone who bought Cyberpunk on PS4 if they wanted.
AverageBoi55,"My brother bought Marvel‚Äôs Avengers for us to share and play, that game bricked his ps4 and now is a dead game"
Nightshade-79,I've been scrolling for a while looking for anyone mentioning Evolve. That game was so hyped and wound up free to play after not very long from memory
CrusaderLuke,Brink
those1fat1rolls,Callisto protocol
TheHighKingofWinter,"Avengers, without a doubt"
ThePencilRain,"Battletoads on NES.  


I am still convinced that I got a demo cartridge that only has the first three levels.  


Mostly because I've never beaten the goddamn turbo tunnel."
captonkrills911,No man's sky on initial release
Squish_Squoosh,Ark survival evolved I love the game but haven't got a strong enough computer
gavins-friend-,I felt this for the first time with Gotham knights. It's worse cause I made my friend pay full price for it too.
Dahyton,"Warhammer Darktide. When i pay full price, half the promised features and things shown in the trailers shouldn't be ""coming soon."""
Pro_Hero86,Anthem
MasterhcSniper,Call Of Duty Modern Warfare II. Most updates are focused on the free 2 play parts like Warzone 2.0 & DMZ instead of multiplayer maps and gamemodes.
JerkfaceJr777,"Grand Theft Auto Remastered- this game completely sucks and is in most ways inferior to the base originals. The graphics are shit, songs are missing, it‚Äôs still filled with bugs, and most models/textures were clearly ran through some quick automated model vs being deliberately designed by a human. A sloppy mess clearly undeserving of a $60 price tag. Rockstar clearly doesn‚Äôt give a shit about these games and thought so little of them as to delegate development outside the company to Grove Street Games (a mobile game company!) who themselves didn‚Äôt give a shit and were defiant and insulting in response to fan backlash. Rockstar has enough resources from their GTA5 micro transactions to do this game right (and since they didn‚Äôt to refund buyers of this shit title). Not the disaster that cyberpunk was but a totally unforced error where they promised the world and then did just everything wrong."
xX_69noob_Xx,Back 4 Blood. Or any other game I've bought that then goes on sale days/weeks later.
ntmrkd1,"Digimon Survive. I was aware of the VN aspect of the game, but I was not aware of how lackluster everything felt."
SableHalloway,My Friend Peppa Pig for my daughter.
St0rmtr00per69,Madden every year‚Ä¶..
Knight275,Watch Dogs: Legion
StardustCrusader147,The new mario strikers
AceBricka,For me it‚Äôs overwatch because I don‚Äôt find overwatch 2 fun and can‚Äôt play the original anymore. They robbed me
Giorggio360,"The Outer Worlds. Reviewed well and had a strong first few hours or so, meaning it showed well in a lot of first impressions YouTube videos.

Never seen a game so frontloaded. Rest wasn‚Äôt bad but nowhere near as good as the first planet. Once you get to the third planet and realise it‚Äôs the same jokes, same story, pretty much the same enemies every time, it wears thin.

I would have enjoyed it if I spent ¬£20 or so, but ¬£50 was not worth it."
Skauge,Battleborn
ExcellentWaffles,The division. I just didn‚Äôt expect the bullet sponges to be that spongy.
HasperoN,"Outriders.

Made me lose all faith in those devs"
loopy95,Pok√©mon Diamond Remake.
Saint9232,These days? Most of them
NothingIsTrue55,Far Cry 6. I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking. So boring
IAmKingSatan,Anthem
Damasticator,"I didn't pay for it since I was so young, but my uncle bought ET for the Atari 2600."
Ftpini,Brink. That‚Äôs the last game I bought that I never got over. It was bad at launch and they abandoned it.
TheTrollmanOfYore,Duke Nukem Forever. *mic drop*
bambinoquinn,Marvels Avengers and WWE2k22. Neither got played after the initial week.
Jahavan,Aliens: colonial marines     - I was so hyped when I saw the trailer
Bahnd,"Everyone referencing recent purchases and disaster launches as if they are the worst thing since haribo sugar-free gummy bears.  These are peanuts to the 15 years of vaporware, false promises and bankrupted studios this game left in its wake.  You will never know the disappointment and my shame.

I bought Duke Nukem Forever... Full price, Day one, with a pre-order... Never again.

Remember kids, no pre-orders."
ReElectSkroob2024,Destiny 2. My friends convinced me to buy it to play with them then immediately a dlc came out and they wanted me to buy that to keep up. F that. Now the vanilla game is f2p anyway!
jinxxybinxx,Mass Effect: Andromeda
PandaKing550,Ac Valhalla bought gold and never finished it.
misslehead3,Swtor
,The new mw2 and also escape from tarkov
Happyfuntimeyay,"The Outer Worlds, it was like the first 20 percent of a real game."
Zagatho,Assassin's Creed Valhalla. That was the game that made me stop preordering or buying at day one. Most games now even the new ones I wait for em to be on sale.
HammosWorld,Animal crossing for the switch. I regretted buying it and then regretted putting 150 hours into it
simulatedkayas,The GTA Trilogy.... F/CK Rockstar!
LordsWF40,"ANYTHING  thats on games pass/ea play. For example,  ive bought almost all the star wars games mostly at release for full price, there all Ea play (comes with game pass). So yea ..thats a waste of money"
CursedArc9542,"EA's Star Wars Battlefront 1 and 2. 1 was ok but not worth the full price and 2 was awful at launch. If I'd picked BF 2 up 2 years later, it would have been worth it then as all my issues with the game were sorted out."
bleebleblabble,"cod: vanguard - i know i should‚Äôve learned my lesson by this point, but i guess i just wanted to relive the cod: waw days"

anonymous32434,Borderlands 3 super ultra deluxe version. Can‚Äôt remember the exact name but I remember that I despise the game
Novalll,Avengers
TheDickDangler,"None.  I operate on the ""wait 2 years for all the bugs to be worked out and all the DLC to be included at 1/3 the price"" system"

supmydudes12,Brink on Xbox 360. Absolutely rubbish üòÇ
LowIronLvls,"Not sure if anyone remembers it but MAG, a hyped up multiplayer shooter. Fucking awful. 

All the way to GAME on a bus after school for that."
stupendouslydude,Rainbow six Siege. Fuck that no campaign having game. The story is what I loved about the series!
boca_leche,Destiny. Pre ordered it for the 360 because Bunge. Last game I have ever pre ordered. I enjoy halo and story driven shooters. Destiny is not that.
onelove7866,God of War Ragnarok - not because it was a bad game but because I‚Äôve seen it for cheaper now and I‚Äôm just a cheapo like that üòÇ
undecidedquoter,Mass Effect Andromeda
subtleheartlycan,"Resident Evil 3. i love the series but cmon, the game was like six hours of content‚Ä¶"
Cold-Bandicoot1707,"Pok√©mon violet. 

Started it and just never turned it back on it didn‚Äôt pull me in at all."

awildNeLbY,"Agony. I wanted to support more games with Hell as an environment, but the only Hell I experienced was trying to play the game the week it came out."
Jeeper08JK,MW 2022
highcarlos,The newest cod. Already uninstalled that shit to make room for assetto corsa mods
Pansie_Schioler,ET on Atari 2600
CatIsOnMyKeyboard,"Destiny 2... Plus all expansions up to Beyond Light.

I really REALLY wanna like the game since several of my friends play it a ton. But jesus christ, no other game leaves me feeling as utterly drained and bored as this game. Don't get me wrong, the gunplay is great but I just end up feeling like I have zero goals to work towards. Usually games that have a lot of armor and gear to customize with hook me a lot, but the only time I actually get to see any of it is when I'm just sitting at the tower. I honestly think I'd enjoy the game a lot more if they had a third person option (outside of just using a sword) since at least then I'd care about trying to get new armor.

And then there's the actual gameplay loop. The actual loop just feels like a job to me. Just completing soulless ""dailies"" and ""weeklies"" over and over in a cycle. When I play a game, what usually drives me to keep playing is story, cool looking armor as a goal, or uniquely satisfying gameplay. I've really tried to enjoy the story in Destiny, but the fact that I feel like little more than a bystander makes it feel more enjoyable just to watch it on YouTube. And as I said before, the gunplay is good but it doesn't exactly do anything new. It's just well executed shooting, which tbh there are so many FPS games that it just doesn't really hook me. And I've already mentioned my issue with armor as a goal.

And I mention this game here because I bought it at full price on release to play with my friends, only to have the game go F2P with zero gifts for having paid $60 for it. Makes me feel like I paid full price for a beta test without being told that that's what it was."
endplayzone,Monster Hunter
