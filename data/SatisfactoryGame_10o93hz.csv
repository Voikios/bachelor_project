RedditHiredChallenor,Be sure to post that glorious spaghetti you're bound to have when you finish Tier 2 production.  It's always beautiful in its chaos.
paleo2002,"Me:  I set up my smelting so I can easily expand it as I get miner and belt upgrades.  Pretty sweet!

This Sub:  I made a giant refinery plant that [looks like a giant refinery](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/10ntb14/9000_rubbermin_refinery_is_up_and_running_more/)."
Dutchtdk,"Lots of the factories are under 10 types of recipes and arent too complex, just a high input and output which makes the factory bigger.



Most fancy designs are just completed factories which have been ""wrapped"" in a fancy design after completion.


Now how fancy you make it, that is all dependent on your skill, but not a necesity.



Then you have the madlads that weave their structures through the confined canyons and plateaus from the get go and don't have much wasted space yet make every nook and cranny beautifully decorated."
houghi,"Don't stress too much. Just enjoy it. I know that will be your intention. Write that down and re-read it when you are stressed, because you will be."
TheLostDovahkiin,"Me : sees people doing fancy and cool looking stuff
Also me : trying to build fancy and it looks like a dirt house in MC"
thisdude_00,"Remember, nothing you build is permanent in satisfactory"
King_Burnside,It's a rewarding learning curve.
Blind0bserver,If it makes you feel better I've been working off of the same save since I bought this game three updates ago and I'm working on trying to get drones and I *still* feel like a chump compared to some of the people I see post builds here.
-D-FENS-,Haha took me 5 hours to figure out how to automate rotors and reinforced plates. Then I make the mistake of coming here.
DurzoSteelfin,Quick! Run while you still can! Save yourself!
nightwolf483,"Ralph we talked about this! You have to walk the 10,000 foundations like the other pioneers can't be taking the bus it's reserved for lizard doggo execs, what would Becky say?"
Cpt_plainguy,"One of the few games I have played where I actually didn't notice the passage of time, good luck Pioneer"
Unkindlake,A little radiation never hurt anyone
freakstate,I stopped at Oil stage. And I've not played in about 18 months. Apparently you build cities now??!!!!
Plat-O_18,"Joining this sub was good and bad. See so much cool stuff but also quite depressing seeing all that cool stuff!

I’ve learnt lots of things from seeing some of the advanced builds. I try and use little bits and pieces I’ve seen. My builds have improved a lot since joining this sub."
Yozysss,"Well... i've got like 200h on a save, don't even reach nuclear power and i'm too afraid about it haha. Also looking this sub give me so much energy and drain it instantly when ibrealise how much work you have to do to make it."
lukyth1rt3en,Don't worry. This game has a very good progression curve that makes it pretty easy to learn as you advance.
Eric_Bigglesworth,My social life anytime I go to boot up this game
maxiquintillion,Don't watch any of kibitz' stuff. Unless it's the first few episodes.
wolfe_br,"Literally me earlier today, when I saw that giant Refinery with over 500 shards used just to reach the next tier... Meanwhile the best I did towards the space elevator was making a very small building to produce only the final parts from a stockpile of stuff... :sad:"
The__Dark__Wolf,Did you also get the game with the Base Builder Sale?
4y744,"My least favourite part about this game is making the most beautiful and elaborate mega project, just to realise a few minor (or major) flaws and quit. Then a few months later to lose your restraint not to play and repeat the cycle. Don't get me wrong, it's always a good time when playing satisfactory, but big projects can ruin your motivation to play."
ItsChaBoyKevin,The best past of the game for me was learning and advancing to the high tiers
wawoodworth,I literally have to log out and leave it for a couple of days while I think through a logistics issue.
486321581,The 98% of player that actually dont have crazy cool base will get a voice here!
486321581,"I only feel in danger of learning new tricks, so... fine xD"
AnteaterWinter2453,I decided to make everything horizontally instead of vertically. It looked horrendous
