Ok-disaster2022,"As a big One Punch Man fan, I gotta say OPM does have 1 major super ripped old man. He's considered the 3rd greatest known hero after a Telekentic that's like a natural disaster, and a guy with the ability to warp space. The irony of the series is the Titular Saitama is relatively unknown because his fights are so anticlimactic."
