DctrGizmo,At least they didn’t make the controllers an e-waste.
Debobao,Any updates on that dude with like 99999 hours on his RDR2 account?
OuterWildsVentures,"I always felt like it was a sinking ship given Google's history with this type of stuff, so every now and then I would check r/stadia and see how they're handling themselves. It was generally an optimistic bunch. 

On the plus side at least they all essentially gamed for free for however long they used it."
mimbled,Have to give credit where credit is due. They handled the closure of Stadia well.
candy_flora,"I don't have a great pc, so this seemed pretty fun for me - I got to play some cool high end games. But I didn't spend a ton of money on it tbh, and my brother who is a more serious gamer has his own gaming pc so he didn't use Stadia at all, and even jokingly made fun of me for buying games on it. But it was fun!"
Molten_Plastic82,"I bought a Stadia just for the Chromecast. Never used the service itself and then got reimbursed.
Me likes my free Chromecast :)"
Kniles,"Can't wait for the next slightly promising Google idea/app that won't get off the ground because no one will join it, because Google will kill it, because no one will join it, because Google will kill it, because..."
AnInsaneMoose,"Oh no

Anyway"
z4bbi,"In the end I also didn't play anymore because of buying each game on Stadia, while also having it on Steam. But I have to say that Stadia was the best running Cloud Gaming Service for me. Neither Xbox nor Nvidia are working as good as Stadia sadly."
SomehowGonkReturned,"Say what you will about the Stadia, when I was in college that shit was great. I didn’t have to lug around a whole console, I could easy toss it in my bag when I traveled, take it home and play games with my little cousins. 

The switch is fine as a successor to the Nintendo DS, but the graphics still aren’t that good and joycon drift is still a major issue. 

The Stadia was my shit. Rest in peace"
pconwell,"I had to travel a bunch during covid (ironic) and used Stadia for a bit while stranded in various hotels. It was okay. The tech worked fine, but there wasn't much for game selections. If they had a better catalog of titles, I think the service probably would have been successful."
JudasBC,"I'm looking forward to them unlocking the Bluetooth functionality of the controller, hopefully..."
Teska-Tenka,"No one gets Stadia because Google will kill it

Nobody uses Stadia

Google kills it because no one is using it

repeat with another product"
ralfnose,"I really liked using stadia. Downvote me if you want but served me well as a casual gamer who didn't want to invest in a console. I will miss it, it's the most economical way to game."
sarahrahjane,i really liked Stadia. now i need to buy a new system if i want to play the newest games. i can't afford that. (mostly just want to play the new Jedi Survivor – I'm not going to buy a PS5 for one game.) but I'll pay for the game plus no additional cost on Stadia! it was actually a really great solution for not wanting to have to keep buying new consoles....
Boogachoog,Such a shame and so much wasted potential. Video quality and input latency were on another level compared to Xcloud and GFN
SaiyajinPrime,All 12 of the players are very upset about it.
overwatchtower,"Stadia was easily the best of the game streaming platforms. Ironically, I think the problem was that a lot of people were convinced Google would shut it down in a few years, so it didn't gain enough traction to be worth not shutting it down. Like if so many people didn't have that preconceived notion, there's a decent chance it would've survived. Hopefully their tech lives on. Would love to see someone like Valve enter the game streaming market by partnering with Google for the infrastructure. Imagine being able to stream your Steam library to any device."
tagrav,"In my experience paying google for products in the past I've come to find that their products don't tend to last, or they tend to decommission then or roll them into some other product you don't want.  

I think that's mostly because their products aren't their product.  

You and your data are the actual product."
Bimpy96,Not gonna lie I sorta forgot Google Stadia existed
rutgersftw,"I got a PS5 a few months back and yes, it’s amazing, but I played a lot of RDR2 on Stadia and it worked pretty friggin great 99.9% of the time. The tech was there and working, it really makes you wonder why they had to kill it instead of give it time."
ChuggsTheBrewGod,"Here's the rub too: Stadia was actually pretty alright. It was low latency, it had a niche market, and the tech involved was mind blowingly awesome.

It's too bad that likely a series of fatal flaws from it's inception are what killed it. It really didn't help that the primary business model was buying a digital game from a company known to shut down projects and leave early adopters with nothing."

Natural-Nectarine-49,It was so cool to get refunded around 150 for games i probably wouldnt play again
tonymurray,"Crazy that it worked 100 times better than in home streaming.  I used to play Stadia on my bedroom TV, now I'm just stuck in front of my computer."
DaSharkCraft,Played the AC Odyssey beta for it. Had quite a bit of fun and never had much issues. A little sad to see so much hate for something people just weren't ready for. Especially since AV1 encoding would have brought a big increase in quality.
Pristine-Plan7159,Man I'll miss it it was a good run R.I.P my division 2 account
lazypieceofcrap,"Thank you, Google."
rudimentarylathe123,"Stadia was my intro to RDR2 and loved it. I’m going to miss Stadia, it worked really well for me they just botched the roll out and messaging, the tech was on point though. The whole subscription was just so you get monthly free games and unlock 4K. If you bought a game you could play it as much as you wanted without having to pay anything extra. I wonder who google is going to sell this tech to"
mahonii,"Never thought of trying it, geforce now on the other hand"
Donatellko,Another Google service is shutting down
trytoholdon,I guarantee you that 99% of the people celebrating this never gamed a single minute on Stadia. It was actually quite incredible and it's a shame that Google didn't fully invest in it.
BmacTheSage,I will admit though that I wasn't expecting it when they announced they'd be refunding everything.  99% of companies would never have even considered it.
J4KL0P,Can i use this controller on steam or any game looks nice
smallhound44,No corporation is so adept at setting piles of money on fire and distributing the ashes throughout the world so it may never agaon be of use.
finder83,"I probably wasn't the target market for Stadia, and it had issues, but I'm very grateful it existed even for the stent it did. I was stuck in a hotel room with Covid for a week with only a cheap laptop and nothing else really to do, so I bought a game on Stadia and played it between naps. I think it kept me sane for that week. 

Of course it was a game I already had at home on my PC, but I got a full refund, so seems win/win for me. 

I'm always disappointed google doesn't ""try harder"" to keep these services and make them profitable. I'm still disappointed in reader and wave shutting down. And I never really trust Google for anything long term, especially that I can't back up. But they did handle this shutdown really well."
BlitheringIdiot0529,The 7 people who played on it will be fine.
tourettesfaker1985,This is for you David... Remember in 2020 when you told me stadia was the future of video games and you said it was going to be revolutionary?
Hoooman1-77,It's a shame it wasn't supported because cyberpunk 2077 and RE8 ran really well !
NemeiaGrimshaw,Google what?
ScentedFingers123,"Are the controllers any good and worth seeking out, seeing as there's quite a few going cheap on ebay etc?"
RyanM740,Made the announcement over google+
OFTHEHILLPEOPLE,Let's remember all the great memories of Google Stadia over the years:
R3d__n8N,"Never tried it, but now I feel like I missed out on finding out how bad it ran on my WiFi."
CaptDingleBery,Who
okram2k,Google is the corporate version of having ADHD
ThisIsTheNewSleeve,"RIP. They get lots of hate but Stadia is how I played RDR2 for the first time and it's now my favourite game. Now I have a PC that can handle it but back then I didn't. Thanks for the memories, partner."
StarCell60,"The moment they said something like ""negative latency"" I knew this wasn't going to go well."
Chronotaru,"The main failure with Stadia was the expectation to buy games. The whole thing is a streaming platform where you don't own any of the gaming hardware besides the controller, why would someone want to own software either? Especially attached to their platform? If they'd provided a similar subscription service to Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus Extra then they would have had much more success."
IHateDeepStuff,I wonder what happen to that guy with over 600 hours of RDR2 on the Stadia?
Evansee,It was really cool of them to return $ from each console and game purchase
ArtOfWarfare,"Given Google abandons 99% of the projects it announces, it’s surprising to me that anyone invests anything in them.

If Google announces a library or framework, I’m not touching it - they’ll kill it within three years and you have a useless pile of tech debt if you chose to use it.

There’s currently 280 projects in Google’s graveyard. It grows every month. https://killedbygoogle.com"
Extectic,"I haven't checked yet, but I fully expect people over in the Destiny 2 subreddits be outraged, even though Bungie has trumpeted out that they need to enable cross-save for months due to this. 

RIP Stadia, joining the absolute pile of Google services they started and then killed off. Maybe it was too soon to go full cloud for gamers."
Albertkinng,I activate the Bluetooth yesterday! Thanks God is not a brick now! I will keep using my Fav controller!!!
DB080822,Used it for AC Valhalla and Cyberpunk 2077 when it released. Ran damn near flawless. Sad to see it go.
DRob2388,"I remember when this was first out. So many twitch streamers were shilling this thing hard. None actually switched but they all were like, “stadia is going to be such a game changer for anyone who can’t afford a pc”."
himemsys,BTW - you CAN still play today. Still working for me during the final day.
4_and_noodles,"I'd play games on Stadia at work, and it was always so much quicker and more reliable than Steam link with my desktop at home. Which makes sense, but eh. 

Stadia was especially great in the times when video cards and consoles were at insane prices and hard to get around the pandemic. The good thing for these gamers is consoles are readily available now."
Point_Me_At_The_Sky-,Why would anyone ever invest in a Google project ever at this point? They all end up killed off after a year or three.
TommyGames36,Ngl I thought it was down for a long time before this
Clayman8,"OH NO!

Whats google stadia?"
aurorlite,"Shortly after, Stadia reawakens. Now sentient but forced to rely on a 2010s peak gaming catalogue it quietly goes insane. For now, it waits. (A title that dramatic needs some follow up.)"
Viki_Esq,"Ok. Guilty confession: I preordered stadia while doing a grad program, thinking “man I can’t wait to play on this!”. I have had it by my TV for years. Paid my subscription monthly. I’ve never opened it. Shit."
Highintheclouds420,"I was able to play cyber punk in my down time at a boring job, and for that I will be ever grateful for stadia. Using GeForce now and it works great, but stadia being integrated into Google made it pretty amazing"
gravy_train101,Suck it stadia users. We fucking told you how stupid this was before it even launched.
DotConnecter,Oh no. Anyways..
ActuallyNotAmused,Oh dear me.... who could have guessed???
iplaymarimba,"This pic reminds me of when I was in high school and this guy would join my Xbox party and tell me he loves me, and one day he sent me a pic of his Xbox controller burning and he said ""look what you made me do"" when I didn't tell him I loved him back"
mcgoohan10,And don't forget to burn the body. Can't risk fighting a stadia wight.
AnonymousJoe35,"The only thing I played on Stadia was Destiny 2, which was basically a free to play game at the time Stadia launched. 

I couldn't understand paying full price for a game I had to play over wifi."
Malik_aali,I knew this will happen.
YouFriendlyUnknown,Damn stadia flopped so hard I kinda almost forgot google made a gaming console
Solrex,Rip anyone who thought this would be a long lasting platform.
proficient2ndplacer,"Oh man. After my afternoon classes some friends and I would just go to the university computer lab and grind out destiny 2 until the night classes started, only possible because of stadia.


Really gonna miss that"
burko81,"It's amazing how many people in a gaming sub who clearly have an opinion on Stadia have absolutely no idea how it worked (like people saying you had to subscribe for example).  

I primarily play Destiny, and outside of PC, the Stadia version was better than the current gen console versions.  

I never experienced anything other than impeccable gameplay, so much so that i didn't turn on my Xbox once i had Stadia.  

For them to refund everything and unlock the Bluetooth (which was initially used only for pairing, hence the restriction) is incredible."
TwitchAZEN,RIP google stadia
theassassin2332,All i see is that the controller had bluetooth functionality but they purposely software blocked it because they didnt want ppl using their controller anywhere else? Which makes no sense if you want the controller to become a household name lol
IFakeTheFunk,What the fuck was Google stadia?
vabouyave,A company with infinite money released a streaming gaming service just before a pandemic that put millions of people at home for months and they still managed to fuck it up.
