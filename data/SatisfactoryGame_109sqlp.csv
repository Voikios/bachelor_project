mainest_,"Disabling dialogue in audio settings turns off the creepy voice. This also will mean that ADA is muted, which way or may not have an impact on your efficiency."

not_from_this_world,Plant? Isn't it a crystal?
Choripan_Lig_Salado,There's a plant that talks? Oh no
roy_rogers_photos,I have a theory that the voice may come from ADA but is actually from the pioneer's mind. The line about other ficsit employees being around and to harvest it before it's too late. Like a parasite that uses whatever memories the host has to help convince them to harvest it and help them spread. The other random VO make me think the same. They're so surreal and creepy.
Luucas202,"First time I heard it, it was about 2am and I was exploring a new territory for steel. I was kind of on my toes already because of not being good at fighting and having died multiple times to the big hog right before.

Hearing 'C O M P L Y' suddenly in a robotic voice certainly did not help."

IRay2015,Iâ€™ve never actually touched the stupid fucking talking fish that draw you in and I kinda wanna do it now just to know if it kills you or what
