Alexxfernandes61,What in the Tarkov rp did I just fuckin read
arct1ccz,"greetings from a friendly gargoyle decorating the resort roof, ... People never look up lol"
NotTactical,You missed the part where you go MIA anyway because you forgot to check if you had Emercom or Railway.
Dayyyman,"Yep im checking that spot every raid from now on, fucking vultures haha"
therealgoodmans,CHAWWWWW!
ArkAbgel059,You could always use a pilgrim as bait with tp scattered in the slots at the bottom of the ramp
TheSaltySeaOtter,Good read. But hyenas don‚Äôt give a fuck.
YungJizzleSnitch,You are an emercom sniper one of many
ALDRFG,"I pray for the possibility to give tribute to the All-Seeing Vulture so that He may offer me safe passage to Emercom.

At the base of the stairs leading upwards towards The Roost, I lay some of my valuables, nuts, bolts and tools, some days gold and others modest sum of roubles or foods.

With my offerings and prayers made, I scurry towards my exit with only the hope that my gifts were acceptable and that the Vulture deems me worthy of Life."
osemaster,Between this and the rat to Chad post I'm fucking loving tarkov reddit today more this less whinin
RespectGiovanni,Im more surpised you arent getting shot by the horde of scavs that spawn behind oli and by emercom campers. A pmc‚Äôs body sticks out on the top of that roof
Jean_Claude_Vacban,"""and as a lone male""

Oh, we know."
-_Dare_-,‚ÄúI squak in triumph and bristle my wings‚Äù lmfao.
guberNailer,"Bro wrote this mid game I‚Äôm pretty sure, while doing his ten minute wait for a victim"
BringBackManaPots,"We used to do this thing we called scav golf on reserve after the karma changes went through.

My friends and I would post up in black pawn and wait for the scavs to clear all the loot out. They all generally worked together thanks to the new karma changes so most of them would make it to ~~extract~~ us, brimming with mid tier loot. They'd get to the extract and then our firing squad would come alive. We'd split it all and pop out of d2 with a minute left, absolutely stacked with a maps worth of loot."

JavxF,"One of my best Tarkov Experiences was a ""Volture/Rat"" one. 

I went into Interchange, waited for many minutes to come and when the shooting stoped, I went in. I went to the Gun Shop to take leftovers but I found a fresh body with EVERYTHING on it, LVL5 armor, huge back pack, gun, etcetera...

After looting it I wanted to EXFILL! I was really new to Tarkov, so I never had such an invetory before, went down through the hole in the mall to take Emercon exfill, when I saw this dude who had the exact same armor as I, he hasitated and I gor a jump scare and just took a shot!... A burst came out and one of them got im in the face. I went to loot him and he as PACKED!... It was weird he had the same armour as I did... So I just took everything and plan to go for exfill... When I saw this OTHER DUDE! in the SAME kind of armor!... He hasitated again, he saw me and he just kept walking like if I wasn't there.. I got another head shot... 

Then I got it, they were all a team, they got the same Vest, Helment, Guns, so they wouldn't confuse themselves with someone else! But I already looted 1, killed 2... Perhaps there was a 3rd one... AND THERE HE WAS!... As I was going to the exfill he and I started a shootout... It was INTENSE! I was about to exit the mall, and shot my last burst of rounds! Only had my handgun left. So I came out, cross the road, jump the defense of the road and hid into a bush!... Waited for some seconds, he came out bursting. He came really close to te bush and I considered taking the shot, but then, he just walked away... Went to Exfill, and I never knew mor of him...

I was tempted on going back to the bodies, you know? A RAT instinct kicked in, I needed MORE LOOT! But I have almost no ammo, and only a handgun, so I waited untill there was only 4 minutes left.. I know as a good rat that people wait even more to exfill, so I had to be in between. I ran to Exfill, Heavy AF... Had 3 vest, many guns, etc. I wanted all of that. And I got it. I belived he was waiting for me at emercon, so I got there as slow as possible, with some rat knowledge not many people posses, but he was nowhere to be found. I got out, and never knew the guy. He tried hard to get me, but I was too much of a rat for him, and I got his friends loot with me.

In a single raid I took WAY MORE than I wanted too, killed 2 high lvl players and got out with 0 injuries... That day, was a good day."
LogNberry,"Lotta haters. Happy hunting, preying?"
JadenAUT,ok ok ok ok guess we have a new playstyle of ratiness :D so its chad > rat > vulture hahahah nice
JebstoneBoppman,"Hello, Vulture  


I am a squirrel. I believe we can live in peace and both get what we want. Does this proposal sound enticing to you?"
KniffelLive,I lold hard. Thanks
FlameForFame,"Great story. Absolutely love to see how many people are getting angry over this. Keep up the great work, vulture!"
Positive_Insurance_5,Bruh did I just read Tarkov rat poem lmao
Ted1590,edgy
Bonus-Representative,I am the happy Scav... I have great Fence Karma - I spawn with great loot. I can scav Factory for 5mins twice in the time it takes Vulture to wait until last the last 10mins - and I have 4 mins in hand. I am the happy Scav.
Caine_Pain333,Actually enjoyable to read very poetic lmao
Real_Holyfrog,"HAHA MAN, i loved that story"
TGish,Tarkov players are cringiest mfs alive I swear
Molojin,dont care about the playstyle but vultures scavenge dead animals the vast majority of the time and rarely attack animals. get your rp straight
DenOndeBonde,"I fucking love it.  
And I fucking hate it.  


Good job :)"
wpreggae,Extract camping the Emercom is way of life
voxyvoxy,"""Does the lion mourn the death of the gazelle?"" He does everytime he's not the one doing the eating."
Cr1t1cal_Hazard,"We that are above the scum and filth of Tarkov, us the refined gentlemen and scholars that chose to use our brains instead of brawn to best our enemies, we, the superior race, those that wait for the enemy to come to us, we need a universal way of signaling each other. It'll be our brotherhoods secret handshake to signal to each other that we are fellow Members, and that we seek peaceful passage through.

I personally vote for a VOIP ""SQWUUAAK!"" And flipping the bird if thy brother is out of ear range"
ChucklesAcademy,"I would like to read more of this poetic vultures tales.

What say you?

What say you mighty winged beast?"

VultureTX,Amusing
FellowConman,"Thanks for telling me your plans. I will look out for Ratata‚Äôs such as yourself. Some people enjoy the ratty style, some people need it. Either way it keeps it interesting. Sometimes people either can‚Äôt stand losing or don‚Äôt like the game that‚Äôs being played. There‚Äôs a work around to each extract camp. The game to me is being prepared for the right rat. Happy hunting"

exsciled,Fking rat roleplayers fetish lmao. Wierdo
pio_11,tarkov poetry? ü§£
LilMountainHeadband,you're a rat.
ManyyBasedGod,"Weird flex, but okay.

If you just wanna spawn in for the last 10 min to pick around at some carcasses, just run a scav at that point? That‚Äôs kind of the entire point of scavving lmaooo. You can do exactly whatever it is that you‚Äôre trying to do, except without it being an extra 25 min of time wasted waiting for someone who may never even show up since many people avoid Emercom at all costs."
PanProjektor,Forgot about the part where for 20minutes vulture assassin just sits there listening to ambient noise. Fun evening

xbepox,"You would have loved Reserve before D2. I used to snipe from the hill and just stack bodies down below before going to collect. No scav karma, tons of loot and gear from players, scavs, raiders and bosses alike. It was a different time."

Kindly-Mine-1326,"Careful dude. When you pick up a GPU, there will be still a cheater that comes flying over to you."
Beef_Boye,"I do the same, but in woods and streets. Feels like the raid goes silent after about 15mins are left, which is when I creep down from my hidey-holes and loot my goblin kills. I almost feel bad for the poor souls that try to loot the bodies. Almost."
Pyromanuel,"I, too, shall follow the way of the Vulture!"
GreNaderz,"i think i lost braincells reading this

not because of the extract camping or anything just cause it's really edgy"
goliath-og-2021,How do you get above oli?
goliath-og-2021,How do you get on top of oli?
Sloopydupy,"I am the vulture. I prey on dead players and scavs. You typically won‚Äôt see me until there‚Äôs 10 min left in a raid when I leave my roost and converge on the carrion for a feast.  
  
I‚Äôve watched the whole raid from my perch above Oli, where I drink my water and slickers. Some rats and chads are able to scurry past unharmed, but many are not.  
  
I see a thick chad through my valday, crawling by the blue wall towards emercom, laden with loot. I almost feel bad as my silenced AKM rains PS ammo down on to him. There‚Äôs no where to hide, and he has no idea where to shoot back. His thick body laying lifeless, my belly grumbles with hunger but my instinct is to wait. Wait in my nest until the other scavengers come to feast. It‚Äôs not long before player scavs are surrounding the carcass. With a well aimed shot, they are put down, but more keep coming, unaware of the vulture circling overhead. After the bodies are piled up high, the vulture drops his insured weapon and armor in order to fully gorge himself as the raid timer drops below 5 min. A FIR Ledx on a player scav? I squak in triumph and bristle my wings. This is the year of the vulture!  
  
Being a vulture is a way of life, and as a lone male, I justify it as nature taking its course. Does the lion mourn the death of the gazelle?"
CeoOfLighthouse,"Me and some buddies did this strat two wipes back. It was sadly super satisfying to be a little vulture. It's a hybrid rat strat. Let em all loot up, wait for a juciy boi, drop him, and then wait some more. Interchange and Reserve were awesome maps to be a vulture."
synthetic9,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
noprnaccount,"Interesting but a culture shouldn't be seeking out combat, more like taking good scraps before the scavs get there"
GregasaurusRektz,"For those wondering my typical build.  

Helmet, cheap body armor, ears, large chest rig.  Basically anything around my stash.  If I‚Äôm not down bad I prioritize a decent helmet over body armor just in case I‚Äôm spotted and someone gets a lucky shot off.  

1 grenade, preferably vog or impact but any will do.  A LOT of scavs and PMCs will come out from the entrance right below you and opening with a grenade is pure bliss on groups of two or more

Gun - variable zoom optic like Elcan, valday, or vudu.  Silenced anything with semi auto capability.  My go to has been AKM but anything will work.  In previous wipes I‚Äôve been sniping up there but I find the semi auto is a lot better since people are on the run and I can get 4-5 good shots off instead of 1-2.

Happy hunting"

loongod5,Buddy you just described a rat.
