Temporal_Illusion,"**For The OP**

1. We normally don't allow IRL Posts like this (see Rule 11), but in this case I have approved the Post.
2. The discussion on how to build a similar crossing in Satisfactory is very helpful to a lot of Pioneers.
3. PLEASE NOTE: The use of IRL Building or Object ""Inspirations"" along with a Screenshots of your Structure in Game using those ""Inspiration"" is OK.
4. In the future watch what you post.

HorseVengeance,"ramp, 1m foundation, ramp... sorted"
No_Concert_4615,"At this time a railroad is the archenemy of vehicles, not a single one, not even the explorer can pass over them. Sometimes driving tangential to them can get vehicles stuck or send them flying for some reason.

&#x200B;

I'm not saying it needs signaling too, even though that would be nice, but at least something we can use to upgrade existing railway sections to smooth them for vehicles or even walking"
Lraund,"Yeah, that's why [I build my whole tracks into foundations.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6yFmmxSssI) Though I only use trains for self transportation + mats."
PsychologicalTowel79,"This underground tram video has embedded rail crossings and a very Satisfactory look. Also, it is not a factory.

JVonDron,"Elevated rails, it's the only way to monorail."
speedysam0,"So there‚Äôs this newfangled structure you might not of heard of, it‚Äôs called a bridge, it allows for paths to cross without interruption to either path. /s"
WolfeIsntWolfie,It's actually fairly easy to make yourself
LazarusOwenhart,Yeah we really do.
ICANTTHINK0FNAMES,Exactly! I hope we can get railroad crossings at some point.
RMSHN,I already saw on Reddit how someone did that... There was a video
LeoRidesHisBike,"Not just this, but also the day-glo orange conical version and wet floor signage while we're at it."
sir_ramen,"I often imagine using the edges of rails as a sort of guide for rendering empty space. Like when making forks or making your own rail crossings so there's no clipping.

I hate clipping."
big-succ-2,Indeed
TrainsAreForTreedom,grade seperated heavy rail transit:

hshshuzbwijsn,"Bro we need this. I think some one made a traffic light mod so surely they could tie up the lose ends and make this work with train signals and then get like a train to foundation thingy

Edit spelling"
skepticalmiller,I like trains.
coreywindom,I think it should be in the game but my trains are all elevated so I would not have any use for it.
Gunk_Olgidar,Just drop the rails down 1m onto foundation .  Works fine.
