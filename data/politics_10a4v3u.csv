SyzygySusurus,Oust?  Feinstein is running for re-election?!  Oh c’mon!

> Sen. Dianne Feinstein&#039;s colleagues aren&#039;t waiting for her to formally announce her retirement from the U.S. Senate before backing would-be successors: Sen. Elizabeth Warren has put her &quot;Full support&quot; behind Rep. Katie Porter, the Orange Country-area lawmaker and Warren prot&eacute;g&eacute; running to replace the 89-year-old California senator.

> Warren&#039;s early embrace of Porter&#039;s candidacy is a de facto snub of Feinstein, but also a reflection of Warren and Porter&#039;s decades-long personal and professional relationship.

> Warren took Porter, herself an aspiring law professor, under her tutelage and hired her as a researcher for one of Warren&#039;s major bankruptcy projects.

Read_Weep,"89-year-old and with dimming attic lights Feinstein. 

While I thank her for her service, the best exit Feinstein could hope for is to be replaced by the likes of Katie Porter."
JohnnyPantySeed,Katie Porter is one of the few I've seen articulating problems well AND trying to help. She's smart and capable.
honorcheese,"Porter would do a great job. That's a nice endorsement too. Warren knows her stuff. If you're ever having a bad day, look up the video of her taking down the CEO of Wells Fargo. Never gets old."
Zetesofos,The Senate should not be a retirement community
Singer211," Feinstein will be over 90 years old by the time of the last election.  And she has not sounded great recently.  And Senators serve 6 year terms.

Frankly if she won’t bow out gracefully, she SHOULD be pushed out imo."
tlsr,"Unbelievable that someone that ~~wants be~~ *will be* some 97 friggin years old at the end of her next term, refuses to just retire."
PhishInThePercolator,"This is good news for those of us that want to see a Chuck Grassley / Dianne Feinstein 2024 presidential ticket. We need Dianne to focus on a presidential run, not a Senate run!"
fairoaks2,Porter is a remarkable legislator.
geraltoffvkingrivia,My grandmother is 83. She gets what I tell her mixed up with other people mid conversation. She can’t go outside by herself. She needs someone home with her all the time. And you’re telling me a 89 year old is fit to be a senator for the biggest state in the country? Nah.
tastygluecakes,"Whoa hold old, Dianne was just starting to get into her groove!"
mokango,"Sounds like it'd be really awkward at 4pm dinner in the Senate Cafeteria when they run into each other, if Feinstein could remember who Warren is or that either of them are senators."
KevinCarbonara,Feinstein's going to be very upset after an aide spends 30 minutes attempting to explain this to her
pomonamike,"Feinstein is nearly 90. Who the hell should be working at that age? Surely she has accumulated enough wealth to live comfortably for the rest of her life. She should welcome passing the torch to Porter. Honestly, she should retire now and allow Newsom to appoint Porter, just like when Harris became VP."
BigBonesMilk,89 is way too old.  These prehistoric politicians should be in a nursing home and not making decisions for our country.
tavo791,We need more people like Porter representing us
Kagomefog,Porter was one of Warren's Harvard Law students and one of her political protegees (like Boston mayor Michelle Wu).
LUNA_underUrsaMajor,"Heres Dianne's $40 million dollar lake tahoe home she recently sold:

https://therealdeal.com/sanfrancisco/2021/11/20/dianne-feinstein-finds-buyer-for-lake-tahoe-compound-after-10m-price-chop/"
xwing_n_it,"I read that Barbara Lee is also planning to run for the seat. I like Lee, but she'd be 82 when she took office. We need new blood."
PrettiKinx,Ugh. Feinstein  needs to go.
Esc_ape_artist,"Y’know, one of the reasons we got our presidential term limits was to keep people from dying on the throne like the kings and queens ruling the lands our ancestors left.  


It’s insane that an almost 90 year old is still in office."
Malodoror,Feinstein’s been fucking up since the Zodiac killer investigation.
Hot-Bint,Who doesn’t? She was a good senator but her time has passed.
Dewahll,That’s way too old to be governing.
averageduder,"I don’t get the strategy in this endorsement. It seems like there’s going to be a primary from at least 3 of Barbra lee, Adam schiff, porter, newsome, and Eric swalwell. What’s the purpose in endorsing almost a year before the primaries even start? 

I like Elizabeth warren the person. But she doesn’t seem to have great timing / strategy."
giddy-girly-banana,I’ll never forgive her for hugging Lindsay Graham after the rapist judge’s scotus hearings.
kingofthejungle223,The only thing I don't like about Katie Porter running for Senate is that I want her to run for President.
Ceratisa,"I mean, does anyone like Dianne at this point?"
JojenCopyPaste,She's doesn't have a bid to oust 89yo Feinstein. She has a bid to oust 91yo Feinstein.  Just retire...
enjoimike49,Someone please wake up Feinstein and let her know
Lollipoop_Hacksaw,"Feinstein is a barely cognitive dinosaur, and those are the facts. This is not a bi partisan issue, it is a term limitations issue that needed to happen decades ago.


I wish that I could argue that having an older political voice in office helps to keep the older demographic relevant because they would fight to keep them afloat through Social Security and welfare programs, but these old assholes In office have shown that they couldn't give a single iota of a fuck for their generation, so I say fuck it, and convince the older generation to embrace the new blood that may actually care about them."
PenngroveModerator,Imagine thinking someone has your best interest and is in touch.. in their 90’s.
WornInShoes,"These are the next steps towards a Porter presidency

She'll bust out that whiteboard the way Ross Perot would break out the pie charts"
InheritMyShoos,"We, as a nation, need Katie Porter."
Nicktendo,This is like 20 years overdue
,[deleted]
bisskits,"You know, it never dawned on me how truly fucked our government is in regards to age. I work with the elderly and they cannot fathom how to use 2 television remotes, so how is an 89 year old still working in government? Why do these people not want to retire the instant they have the chance?"
Ok-Ease7090,Is Feinstein running again? Thats stupid she should retire gracefully.
CryptoNerdSmacker,Feinstein needs to get her old ass out of the way.
djseifer,"I was in the 5th grade when Dianne Feinstein was first elected to the Senate. Now I am transitioning from ""grown-ass man"" to ""old fuck"" and I think it's time for some new blood to take her place."
Intrepid_Library5392,"At 89, if you need to be ousted, you should be. good god, get the fuck out"
MandalorianManners,"No one over the age of 75 should be in office, period.

It’s these fucking fossils who drag their feet and do more harm than good as it relates to progressive legislation.

Edit: while we’re at it, no one under the age of 30 should be allowed into higher office, either.  Sorry but your brain isn’t done maturing, yet."
bethaneee,I have no doubt this was sured up before the announcement.  This is either a signal from top Dems that Feinstein shouldn't run or Feinstein has said she isn't behind closed doors.  I imagine Porter has 3-5 more high profile endorsement to role out over the next week or so.  She clearly has a well thought out plan and I would expect nothing less.
GraceMDrake,"The last time time Feinstein ran for re-election, the state party refused to endorse her and backed another Dem candidate. I can’t recall his name, which was the problem. She was re-elected handily.

They may not have said so publicly, but I can’t imagine Katy Porter would have tossed her hat in the ring without the blessing of the national and state party. She is well known and popular; I think she’ll do well.

Feinstein should step aside, but it doesn’t look like she’s going to. We have open primaries, so they could end up running against each other in the full election."
PopeAdrian37th,Dianne “the lights are on but no one’s home” Feinstein is an embarrassment of modern politics. Her only use at this point is standing close to Biden to make him look more cognitive to the people taking talking points from conservative media.
samwstew,Nice! Already raising lots of cash and pulled a solid endorsement as well.
AsianMysteryPoints,"It's not a bid to ""oust"" Feinstein; Feinstein is retiring."
Caboos20,Hippie California here.  She needs to retire.  Longest running records be damned.
healyxrt,I’d love the chance to vote for Katie potter for anything
larrythetarry,"Makes sense, Warren was her professor at Harvard law."
Ranvier42,California is an open primary right? So it could be a two rounder loss for Dianne
kabukistar,Hope she wins. We need some new blood in Congress.
Open-Election-3806,Reminds me of storm Thurmond
ClericofShade,"Mrs. Feinstein should retire- but she may not know what to do with herself without the job she has held so much of her life. Way back when I used to work as a housekeeper in a retirement community, one of my clients was a lady who used to work in the Pentagon- and other long-time workers talked of the poor woman riding the elevator looking for her office."
whydoihavetojoin,70. Upper age limit to hold any government office. Elected or otherwise. Judicial included.  Who’s with me.
friedbymoonlight,"Honestly, retire at 65. We don’t need low functioning leadership. Take your pension and advise the next generation.
You too pelosi, McConnell, trump Biden.

Bernie can stay"
Exocoryak,"If Feinstein is running again and winning reelection again, I really hope she's doing as well as my 85 years old grandmother who's still beating us at card games and who we can have great political discussions with. And hopefully better than my other, 87 years old grandmother who is suffering from dementia and living in a nursing home."
PowerAlwaysReveals,"As much as I understand and sympathize with the basic age-related concerns people have about public officials in general, I would still argue that these concerns ought to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. 

Because while I think Feinstein should probably have stepped aside the last time she was up for re-election, I find myself simultaneously hoping for both Bernie Sanders and Angus King to seek and win re-election to the Senate in 2024. Despite their advanced ages—81 and 78 respectively—and understanding that their health six years from now will only become more fragile than it is today, I still feel that both have valuable energy and ideas to offer."
eastbay77,89 years old?!  I wouldn't trust my uber driver if they were 89 years old and these dinosaurs are running the country.
wraithe33,Isn't 89 a good time to get out of the stress of politics and chill on the beach for your remaining years? Is the power that addictive?
FreemanCalavera,"I'm not exactly pro-Feinstein, but holy fuck is this comment section being nasty towards her.

The way people joke about aging, cognitive decline, it makes me sick. This sub routinely defends Biden against accusations of dementia (who has committed a ton more public gaffes in regards to doddiness compared to Feinstein) and actively championed Bernie even though the man had a literal heart attack on the campaign trail. The ones that do criticize them have usually been super tame comments about how they ""should consider retirement for their well-being!"". Meanwhile, the vitriol in the words used against Feinstein and the underlying sexism of these double standards is disgusting.

Yeah, Feinstein is far from perfect and maybe Porter could do just as good a job. But then the people whining better actually show the fuck up to vote instead of complaining about ""young people having no time or energy"" while spending hours bitching about politics on Reddit.

/rant"
herpblerpsmerp,we need a mandatory retirement age for those in government.  something under 100 would be nice lol.
Gunslingering,"Should ask Feinstein to endorse her as well, she will probably do so…"
Mister-Butterswurth,"Millennials: It’s time to stop letting our grandparents and great grandparents generation run shit. In fact, our parents generation needs to go too."
KanyeWestBrick,Feinstein needs to go. 89 is a joke
joshdoereddit,At some point I'm sure Dianne Feinstein will also endorse Katie Porter.
Necessary-Hat-128,Dems need to be as focused on winning as the Repubs. It’s time for Diane Feinstein to retire.
capnmax,I'm so excited for her.
PlayedUOonBaja,She is clearly suffering from Dementia. How does that not disqualify someone?
layout420,I don't think you should be able to hold an office past 75. Not an HOA office and especially not one in Congress.
mrkruk,She's 89?  Prime of her life.  I bet they can roll that ol' gal into Congress at 100.
chelseablue2004,"Katie Porter has 2 Problems:

1. Barbara Lee also threw her hat into the ring to become a Senator and would get the Black Vote as she is a leading proponent on racial equality. 

2. Feinstein will use her connections in establishment to win again so she can die in office. Leeching even more votes.

She needs to get more and more support, like Bernie and other progressives to show she is the one they support."
Whompa,So fucking old just retire already holy shit…
RunRevolutionary9019,Good
bong-water-neti-pot,"Where exactly are Feinstein’s loved ones? Y’all need to be getting power of attorney and helping your damn relative, who is obviously unwell to everyone, and actually addressing her issues."
carfo,Thanks Diane but go home and enjoy your family now time to pass the torch
Select_Insurance2000,"Out with the old and in with the new.
Go Katy!!!!"
thegamenerd,"Honestly those pushing her to continue to run are committing elder abuse

She needs to retire, all you have to do is listen to her talk to see she's got dementia"
tanzmeister,"I'll be honest, I didn't think Warren had it in her."
Died-Last-Night,89?!?! Why are dinosaurs running the country?
brandogg360,Better Katie Porter than thr Grim Reaper
Fragmentia,"Oh damn, I can't wait to vote for Porter in the primary."
ausofbounds,"It should have been down a long time ago.  Hopefully Feinstein has the grace and cognizance to retire and endorse Porter.

I'll go one more and I hate to say this, but Bernie and Liz both need to start looking for successors too."
RafikiSama,"I can’t wait for porter to run for president, she’s one of the rare good politicians"
ifhysm,I don’t understand these articles that are written with headlines that insinuate infighting.
Double-String-1451,I think there should be retirement for Supreme Court judges as well.
Katsu-Shintaro,She’s 89. She’s gotta go. And I assume Warren would step down unlike Feinstein when the time comes.
,89 holy crap. We really need an age limit in congress.
SnooStories5035,I love this woman. Literally one of 2 or 3 politicians actually working for the people.
littletrainthattried,How about Warren and Feinstein both leave?
Free_thought_3231,All of these old ass politicians who have been in there for 30+ years need to go.
Troml,70 would be the limit
SoDear,I’m not sure it’s an oust. Feinstein hasn’t said what she was plans. Katie Porter would be an excellent addition to the Senate! She’s smart and in command.
marvology,"She guaranteed won't run because she KNOWS she won't win. Camping on a safe seat when you're 90 is one thing, but trying to battle a horde of hungry challengers is another. 

The Democratic party has WAY too many doddering, old centrists in power as it is."
Old-AF,NOBODY that is 90 fucking years old should be holding elective office.
Vindolus,Who votes for a 90 year old come on people
NJMomofFor,We need age limits! We need term limits!
arroe621,I'd like to see Adam Schiff run for Senate.
Downtown-Review4908,Yes please!!!!
FrancoManiac,"Elizabeth Warren was her law professor, and the reason she pursued Congress. I am fans of them both."
ligh10ninglizard,"This is an absolute no-brainer. Sorry Diane, you are 89. You had a great run. Learn from Ruth G. It's time to ride into the sunset and plan your end game. This country needs more people of Ms. Porters caliber. There is no need to run against Katie. Instead, endorse her. Embrace her. She is the obvious future and is urgently needed to keep the B.S. from drowning us. Truth to power is rare. Ms. Porter, is that lightning rod the Senate and Democratic Party needs in future fights. Ms. Porter goes to Washington will be a wonderful story that is and will continue to be an inspiration to  all citizens of the United States 🇺🇸"
styrofoamladder,She should have retired quite some time ago. Hopefully she does the right thing and endorses Porter.
toomanyplants314,"Dianne Feinstein has no business being in the senate - it’s common for someone with cognitive decline to not have any idea they’re losing their memory. So it’s really sad & hard to watch this play out in public.

That being said, I can’t remember the last time a democrat senator has come out directly for a primary challenge to one of their colleagues. Interesting if there will be any others."
CoralTwang,Porter was a student of Warren's.  This is expected.
Joanian,I’ve donated. Go Katie!!!
ladywiththestarlight,Katie Porter should be goddamn president as far as I’m concerned. She’s the perfect example of what a public servant is supposed to be.
neuromorph,The same Feinstein that thanked Mcconnel for his service to America?
AmbivalentFanatic,No more politicians over 70.
Status-Sprinkles-807,"People here need a reality check. A lot of comments saying Feintsein is too old when her real problem is she's a neoliberal pro corporate dem from what is supposed to be a very left wing state. 

If she was a leftist and Porter was challenging her from her right I wouldn't be supporting Porter, her age doesn't matter."
KneeDeepinDownUnder,"I love Katie in the House, it’s been a treat to watch her reaming people.  But…unseating Feinstein and squaring off against Texas’ Rafael?  **swoon**. That is just too delicious."
BiochemistryBro,Diane Feinstein was born in 1933. It’s time to hang it up
50clicks,"Effectively senile for at least 15 years,  Feinstein’s career will end tragically  late."
PopeHonkersXII,"""Which one is Feinstein again?""

-Senator Feinstein"
