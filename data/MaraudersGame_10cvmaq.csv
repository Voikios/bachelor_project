HHgameking115,"I tried to climb the second railing while I was in the air, so when I hit the ground I climbed trough the wall.
I was able to walk underneath the entire map and on some spots I was able to look into the map at a little bit.
Was not able to reach the droppod or airlock and had to leave the game."
Jedly1,"I got stuck in the same place, except I was in the wall above that.  I could look out both sides, but not move."

Sandy_Peener,Itâ€™s this spot in particular I think if your head goes above the ceiling when you vault happened to me a couple times. I vault straight at the rail like towards the fire range below.
