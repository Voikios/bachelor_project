FIGHTMAN94,Let me sort ascending or descending too so that the empty space can be at the top instead
Opposite-Shoulder260,you can't even sort the tasks in a proper way so stop asking so much lol
Quetzal-Labs,"I've been fucking around on a little tarkov-inspired project in my spare time, and [implemented an item locking feature in about 5 minutes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91A85qLayt4&t=1m34s)

It's literally like 5 lines of code.

Also has multiple sort types, bottom-up sorting, ctrl+clicking in to any container, you can lock empty slots to always keep them free, you can empty an entire container in to another with 1 command, items stack properly when you drag them in to containers, and you can stack meds of the same healing type (put an AI-2 in to a partially used IFak).

Honestly, it makes me wonder wtf they're doing over there at BSG."
Sm0kebringer,"When I read those kind of post -that I do myself and wich I agree with-, I tend to think that the  concept of ""Quality Of Life"" is totally unknown in Russia...  


(More than 10 years for a BAD autosort ""system""...)"
Clewds,It's my turn to post this tomorrow!
Countcristo42,"It's been suggested so many times, but I will upvote it every time"
Chilishot,"Haha and let us tick only show items put up in the last hour for flea.
The only show items expiring in less than an hour is useless and an insult to everyone trying to find anything rare on flea..."
-Shibdib-,Adding this feature would break healing in raid somehow. Would also add a 20 FPS cap to factory.
blizzach,"I'd also wish for sorting to be available while having items in the sorting table, then i could put all the stuff I wanna sell in it, sort the stash and then put all my stuff to the bottom."
ravenousglory,"You can use sorting table to kinda manually sort parts of your inv. Not perfect, but works."
bufandatl,Could you please post it 4 wipes ago. I think the idea wasn’t on the table back then.
Orsim27,"Just let me move more than one item at a time and I’m happy.

It’s beyond annoying to notice that you need another row of free space in the top of your stash and then you have to move down every item below it one row down."
Gul_Dukatr,or at least make the sort option sort from bottom to top
WingsOfWingsOf,This has been suggested 79091875018 times and BSG has refused/ignored every time
awfeel,"Better yet - let me filter by the OPPOSITE of the categorical selections - let me see everything NOT found in raid, or NOT meds etc. and let me auto sort to the BOTTOM of the stash lol"
Dulliest,BSG : No
SweetyMcQ,Based suggestion.
heyitsfelixthecat,The technology just isn’t there yet
MarcusAurelius0,"The auto sorter sucks, so much so I hate using it.

Often I have to resort to maximize space."
BukLauFinancial,"an easier fix, and something a lot of players would find more practical, is keeping the top 10 rows free"
AbovexBeyond,We’ve asked for this the minute they released auto sort.
ReasonableConfusion,"Yep, been hoping for this since it was first suggested with the introduction of auto-sort.  I'm holding out hope they'll do it.  Maybe... probably not... I don't know."
richard31693,Nikita has stated that this is in the works already. All we can do is wait for it.
buckets-_-,"this gets requested once per week

pls bsg add the feature already we need it"
SkippyMitch,any additional parameters would be appreciated immensely
goodsnpr,"Also, sort only one type of item to the top/bottom. Set affinity to containers so when we click something like barter items or ammo into stash, they auto sort to the correct container.

With crafting now returning a lot of tools, a dedicated tool chest that would take and return would be nice. 

Why do we not have a dedicated key storage slot item in our hideout?

Why not let us right click on a slot on our PMC and equip xyz item?

Why are armored and unarmored rigs one tab on the flea? same with helmets/hats? 

Why do we need to click on each item to identify it at the trader? (Viva la Dirt League has a great skit on this)"
Xedeth,Can we solve the 100 other problems first?
ordinarymagician_,"""Coming soon.""

Next patch: you can pin things so you can't move them, but autosort still does.

Also 3 more AKs that are useless, 10 meme cartridges and one that fills a gap in a caliber but nobody can access it. And more lightkeeper quests! (By which they mean they rephrased Health Care Privacy's questline and moved it to LK from Therapist)"
dj3hac,"This has been suggested countless times in the last 5 years, I don't think it will ever happen."
rodigo1,Fs in the chat for everyone who’s accidentally shuffled their inventory
neckbeardfedoras,I wish the junk boxes would also sort 1x2 items in the same orientation. Drives me nuts.
M-Gnarles,Ahh the daily lock sort thread. It gives me peace and calm when the balance is never broken
Rob_P53,"The game is supposed to ""feel like a punch in the dick"".  Search Goolge on:  ""Viva La Dirt League Tarkov creators"".  A poor inventory system just gets you ready for the game itself. :)   This was all planned, and discussed in the video I mention.  As they say in the military: ""Embrace the suck""  :)"
Pierr0x,"That would be a quality of life improvement, so it won't be implemented. Instead they'll probably give even more cheated X-ray vision and aimbots to scavs."
Tough-Zucchini-6300,I don't think they know how to do that
usprocksv2,"alright sure well implement it BUT u have to do a bajillion task to unlock that feature, also these
task are be locked behind extremely rare keys that wont be in the market enjoy"
IndependentYellow4,"Open sorting table, move stuff you dont want to be autosorted with Lshift + left click, hit autosort, then just drag the items from sorting table to the bottom of the stash"
Tcleve31,Quit trying to make the game easy
