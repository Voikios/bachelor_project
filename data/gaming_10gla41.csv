Rex_Mundi,Let's hear it for the set designers too.
elhawko,"Is it a good show for someone that didn’t play the game?

Edit: Ok guess I’m checking it out. Thanks for the responses.

Edit 2: watched the first episode. Promising start!"
Vwhat5k,"Every time I see his face I think to myself ""God damn it why didn't you just finish the mountain when you had the chance you beautiful bastard."" That first episode was great, easily the best adaptation I've ever seen."
vulture_87,pfft. That light switch was being a diva on shoot day and they had to remove it.
Grynz,"Unfortunately I've never played the game, but I'm thoroughly enjoying the first episode of the show. Not knowing the game may be a benefit here."
VanZandtVS,"Pascal is probably my favorite newish actor.  

He killed it in the Mandalorian and he was the only good part of Wonder Woman 1984.

Dude's got so much range.

Edited to add other roles he's killed:

Oberyn Martell, Game of Thrones.

Javier Peña, Narcos.

Javi Gutierrez, Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent.

Bunch of other roles, and he even had a part in S4 E1 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer back in '99, so I guess he's not that new."
RadSkeleton808,"I walked in going ""huh he doesn't feel like Joel at all to me."" By the end of the episode I 95% was sold. Just want him to grow the full beard (if he can)."
Mr_nudge89,"It was the car scene trying to get through the town that got me, it was spot on to the game, the camera was even in the same place"
HughMungusThot,"The casting in this show is some of the best stuff I’ve ever seen. Tommy is like dead on, it’s kind of freaky."
getyourcheftogether,"Costume design, set design, casting, makeup, lighting, and a shit load of cash helps. Tons of effort beyond the famous faces"
vigneswara,"After the mandalorian & now this, Pedro Pascal is now officially the best Foster parent figure in TV."
ScaryPirateDude,His sleeves are too low. Literally unwatchable.
ckirby7,"Every screenshot I see is an exact replica from the game. I haven't watched yet, but damn it's got me excited."
seth_window26,"""Drugs. I sell hardcore drugs"" so glad that made it to the show"
Telemere125,For anyone that’s played the games and is watching the show: can I watch the show and not ruin the game? Just got a ps4 and was planning on buying LOU 1 & 2; would really like to watch the show but I’ll hold off if it’s going to ruin the games for me
ToyDingo,"This is exactly what an adaptation is supposed to be. It follows the source material very closely but changes barely enough to make it ""different'. 

They didn't rewrite the story. They didn't change the characters personality. They didn't try to shoehorn some stupid political message in there (outside of any message already present in the game). The literally just took the source material and made it a live show. That's it. 

Why is that so damn hard for studios to figure out?"
venom259,Watching the first episode was like going back to 2013 and playing the game for the first time.
RogerOSmith,He’s just standing there
RigasTelRuun,"The director, the designers, the writers, the costimers, the DoP all played a part. Especially is a shot compared to a screenshots where Pedro is just standing there."
sandalcade,"Okay. I don’t play games and I’m coming from /r/all. I’ve scrolled down and only saw references to “the game”. I feel like that Chris Pratt meme at this point, but I’ll pluck up the courage to ask. 

What game/show is this?"
escientia,Was skeptical about his ability to pull off Joel’s Texas drawl but he does a great job.
Darkest_knight3,Only 1 ep in. Relax fanboys
Snorca,Why is there a fence next to him?! Literally unwatchable /s
owowhatsthis--,"Question: If I've only played the first game, but plan on playing the second soon, will the show spoil the second game for me?"
TwoEuphoric5558F,This is about 1% Pedro and 99% the production team. Credit where credit is due.
Sub_to_heskey,"and to think people were mad when they announced Pedro was playing Joel cuz "" hE Didn't lOok LiKe jOel"" . Gamers needs to stop with this doppelganger casting obsession i saw someone in this sub suggested that Triple H (wwe guy) should play Kratos because he looks at real life kratos?"
GhostalMedia,"This picture really just highlights that casting and the wardrobe department are killing it. 

Pedro is crushing it too, but you need to actually watch the show to see that."
GreasyPeter,"How is he so damn likeable in all his roles, even the villain ones?"
Kronic1990,"the people who made this show have shown unbelievable respect to the game and source material, makes me even more bitter about what a shit show the Halo TV show turned out to be.

I knew Halo was doomed the moment they started ""bragging"" about deliberately not following the source material."
Ganjookie,the studio seamstress picked out the perfect denim to match.
AlmightyRuler,"Killing the fungal zombies, maybe. But not the look."
rensanx,"Wait, he is Mando right? Or am I bugging???"
name_cool4897,I love him as Joel. I also love lady mormont as Elle much more than I thought I would.
geoffkreuz,"I honestly dislike it when he was casted as Joel, i think he doesn't resemble the character. After watching episode 1, oh boy, I'm so wrong."
colm180,"Can't believe that they thought ""what's the most apocalyptic city"" and immediately went for the one I live in. 

....but they're also not wrong, sucks ass here"
FabulousYellow0,Matthew Fox was supposed to play him
Flat_Unit_4532,Directors and costume design and set designers and casting and makeup artists and lighting etc etc are killing it
GeraltofRookia,"As soon as Oberyn was introduced to GoT, he was my favourite character and remained like that till the end of the show.

And then he comes here and FUCKING SLAYS again!

I love this man."
DaggerMind,"I was very pleasantly surprised by the first episode. After all the horrific game adaptations we've seen, this was refreshing and can be enjoyed by people unfamiliar with the game."
DrZed400,He almost killed it in game of thrones but he slipped and that big guy got him
Aussiebadgamer67,"Honestly was not expecting much from this show, whole zombie thing is tired and played out or so I thought it was great, tense and well paced."
Serpenta91,"It's nice to see an adaptation respect the source material, unlike what has happened with garbage like rings of power or wheel of time show."
YepImanEmokid,"Loved him in Narcos and Mando, I'll admit he wasn't my first choice for Joel. I wanted Jensen Ackles (mostly for the voice and beard, I'll admit). 

I'm very glad we got Pedro. He's one of the most talented actors working right now."
mainWeiRDo,"I love how, in the truck scene, they mimic the first-person car ride pretty damn well! Overall, the first episode has made me excited and given me hope!"
BattleForAssgard69,Dude better not ever come out in some scandal later I'll fucking lose it
toph88241,"I didn't think Pedro had a big enough frame to pull off Joel, but he's nailing it so far"
CementCemetery,Perot Pascal seems like an obvious choice but then again I’d cast him in just about anything.
The_Notorious_Donut,It was so good. I watched it twice
Zombull,Pedro Pascal is killing it in everything he's in.
Cannabis-Enjoyer98,The scene with the plane crash is also really good. Was scared they would slaughter the series but nah. Its great. A must watch for everyone honestly.
Reinheardt,He and Tommy’s voices were eerily similar to the games too
the-voice-of_treason,"Not gonna lie, I was apprehensive about how this show was going to work out. I played the original game right after my middle boy was born and the opening 20 minutes sent me into a feeling of such dread and sadness I actually took a break from the game, not going to spoil anything for those that haven't watched the first episode or played the games but there's a scene that smacks you right into the feels.

Even though I knew what was coming it hit just as hard in the show. The scenes and characters all done extremely well and the acting is too notch, I wasn't expecting a true to source show and I've grown to distrust writers from tweaking things without reason (looking at you Netflix). HBO and the team behind The Last Of Us have done an amazing job, just don't fuck it up!"
Sporesword,Yeah boi! Excellent Joel.
Traditional-Star1895,I will be the first to say I was WRONG. I was the one who had initial issues with Pedro playing Joel. I’m so happy with the cast and how Bella is killing it as Ellie.
Turbogoblin999,Fun fact: The brick wall that did the MoCap for the game is the same brick wall that appears on the show. :v
1pt21gigawattos,"I prefer the grittier graphics in the bottom pic.  Both look realistic, but you can tell the top one is a game  as it has fewer wrinkles on the shirt and fewer bricks.  The fence is made up of giant diamond polygons.  His face is also much smoother and lacks the detail like the nose cut and damaged eye.  That along with the lack of a beard show they needed to cut polygon count."
Hrast,I was giddy when I found out the voice actor of Marlene from the game is the actor playing Marlene in the show.
Sniffmyplasticglue,"The only tiny gripe I had was that I'd have liked TV Joel to have a more best up, tired face. Other than that, the first episode was amazing. As a dad, when the sad part happened, it genuinely got to me emotionally (not much does so well done showrunners). I loved the sense of panic and dread at the beginning because I knew what was going to happen but didn't know when. 

Can't wait to see episode 2."
Many-Application1297,I’m slightly disappointed that he didn’t sneak up and choke to death the first 30 people he meets. Coz that’s what I did in game.
