Lithuim,Wait until you find out that it‚Äôs all taking place in the Mushroom Kingdom.
tatsumakisempukyaku,Koopas are turtles too.
Farm_N3rd502,Bunch of angry short dicks.
BlueMikeStu,"This is the same sort of mental energy I felt off my brother when he told me ""Navi is called Navi because she's your Navigator.""

Edit: Holy shit, don't tell me my brother is the only idiot who didn't realize this until adulthood."
Wolventec,lore wise i believe they were citizens of the mushroom kingdom and most of them decided to join bowsers army(i guess peaches rule most be worse than bowsers)
Karthathan,What did you think they were? Just weird little monsters? I know when I watched the old Mario Movie they showed goombas as weird shrunken headed dinosaur lizard people so that didn't help me.
intoxicatedjedi,Just wait until you figure out that Mario travels through pipes.... Because he's a plumber!!
bradleysween,Nah bro they‚Äôre muffins
flufalup,Wasn‚Äôt until i was 21 that i learned Limes are not unripe lemons

SirGroovitude,"I literally just figured this out because I started playing Super Mario RPG for the first time and Toad cries for help because a ""mushroom"" is attacking him and it turns out to be a goomba."
longoverdue83,Holy shit I just realized this‚Ä¶

cjpr,"As far as I'm aware, it comes from the Hungarian word 'Gomba' meaning mushroom. (source: live in Hungary for a few years)"
SweetCosmicPope,When I was a little kid I said they were poopoos because they were little brown things going in and out of sewer pipes.
MojoRyzn,"If by walking mushrooms, you mean penises? Yes."
victorbarst,"I feel you dude. It took me until I was 23 to realize ash Ketchum was meant to sound like ""catch em"" and lord farquad was meant to sound like fuckwad"
Archangel289,"Just wait until you find out about the pun in Miles ‚ÄúTails‚Äù Prower. 

Don‚Äôt worry that one took me 23 years."
bugdelver,"Lmao. As a 40-something, who has played almost all Mario games ever created, owned every Nintendo home system since the NES, and turned off the system after discovering the warp-zone in world 1-2 of Super Mario Bros. because I didn‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶ I also just learned this."
Uberdragon_bajulabop,I used to think they were angry wingless owls.

Porfur,Gomba means mushroom in hungarian
Compwert, taking place in the Mushroom Kingdom....
theGuyInIT,Wait‚Ä¶holy shit
OneSession3432,"dude i thought they were turds...

&#x200B;

Mario is a plumber.."
vaszoly,Bro how even do you do that.
res30stupid,"Fun fact -  in the original game's manual, the enemy goombas were originally citizens of the Mushroom Kingdom until they sided with Bowser when he kidnapped Peach. Those who didn't join the coup ended up being turned into the blocks seen on various stages.

Note that not all of them turned traitor - you get some goombas as your starting party members in the Paper Mario games."
RonYarTtam,Dicktipwhat?
Ninjapuppy1754,"I, for some reason, thought they were ants ""cartoonized"""
trullette,"You're not stupid; it's quite easy to not recognize something like that that you've probably seen before you were able to visually connect the mushroom design. Your brain labeled it ""goomba"" and never thought about it again.

That said, this gave me a great laugh so thanks for that :)"
TheBurbs666,Because of McDonald‚Äôs I always thought they were chicken nuggets

Virtual-Park-3349,WTF did you think they were before?
Right-Ability4045,"No there little shits with legs

Alternatively penis tips with legs"
blakeoft,"They're actually chestnuts apparently. I was surprised to read this many years ago.

Edit: It seems they are mushrooms, but the misconception comes from the Japanese name roughly translating to chestnut. Either way, they get squashed no matter what."
SilentStrikerTH,Did you know Sonic is called that because he's super fast? Like super sonic speeds? Ikr smh my head
NOTSiIva,*insert break free persona joke here*
ItsChris1206,"Nah, they talking, walking cocks"
jross217,"Sir, thats a penis"
DeathByFrzrBurn,The bricks and blocks are the people of the mushroom kingdom also
alexpg12,Did you think it was a dick and balls before?
Jonahble,Aren‚Äôt they a type of nut? The reason why they are shaped the same as mushrooms in the first Super Mario Bros game is because the cartridge or something couldn‚Äôt handle a whole different sprite so they just recolored the mushroom. Same reason why the ‚Äúgoombas‚Äù in Super Mario World look nothing like the previous ones. New tech could handle it now but were decided to become their own thing instead.
KnifeyLovesYa,They're chocolate chips.
discotim,"Gomba is mushroom in Hungarian, likely other similar languages"
MathMaddox,38 years old here... Holy shit
added_chaos,This has to be a shitpost
RealKoletos,Mushroom yeah right ...
Poisechad,imo it looks like cock and balls but mushroom would be hilarious
Feisty-Crow-8204,"Since it seems to be a common misconception, Goombas aren‚Äôt nuts, they are specifically shiitake mushrooms. Tekashi Tezuka(co-designer or Mario) says in an interview that they aren‚Äôt chestnuts, but shiitake mushrooms.

https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/wii/nsmb/1/5/"
HandsomeGangar,Actually they‚Äôre supposed to be a certain kind of chestnut iirc
Fireproof_Cheese,"You really want to freak out? In the original SMB, clouds are just bushes colored white."
hyperakt1v,oh u dumb as shit u fucking idiot
air-buc-pirate,Htf did you not know?
MrFormarotica,You have got to be kidding me. This franchise has been around since you were a baby and you're just now realizing this?
Knight_Of_Stars,"They're actually chestnuts, but I do agree they look a lot mushrooma."
CloudyNeptune,"I‚Äôm genuinely curious as what you thought it was, and I hope it doesn‚Äôt rhyme with beanis"
PewaaLuvsInternet,No way üíÄ I wasn‚Äôt even a sperm cell when this game was a thing and even I know that
,How did u not realize this (give me upvotes I need 100 lol)

Mezmo300,Call me stupid but me too op

Izlude,"When I was a child I thought they were little bird faces with feet, like their little stalks were the beak. (Super Mario bros 1, that is)"
Maronexid,mushrooms?     ^(oooooooooohhhh)
Powerful-Brother-791,To be fair I used to think they were potatos.
Turdsley,Wtf did you think they were?
rilano1204,...what did u think they were?
,"Hear me out:

What if every Goomba was once a regular mushroom, that got tired of watching its family get eaten by people, and one day decided to feast on human flesh?

Then they got really stoned, had an awakening, and are now seeking to get that feeling back?"
DweEbLez0,"What you think the game was about?

Frankenfucker,"IIRC, back in the day I read that when Bowser Koopa invaded the Mushroom Kingdom with his Koopa Troopa Army, the citizens of the Mushroom Kingdom that opposed him were turned into Goombas. The Mushroom Retainers (Toad) were kinda like the resistance trying to help Mario. In essence, Bowser conscripted the people."
ColoursRock,You're going to lose your s*** when you realize that Koopa Troopas are actually walking tortoises.
revocer,"In the original SMB, it looks like goombas and mushrooms are the same sprite, with a different color schemes. The goombas just happen to have two+ frames instead of one."
