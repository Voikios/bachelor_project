Jeffreyknows,The first amendment of the constitution? The same constitution these officials swear by? Shocking
MyMainManBrennan,I can't believe people actually support this PoS.
ronearc,Tell me more about these mythical checks and balances.
was_and_wasnt,He violated more than that.  He removed an official we elected.  Disregarded the rule of the voters.  All because the silly little bastard did not like what he heard.  Deathsantis has to learn that we are a free people.  That we are not Russia.  And that we don't have to conform to his preschool understanding of the world.
Mephisto1822,"> Yes, but: Hinkle said federal law does not allow the elected prosecutor Warren to immediately return to office despite the violations.

Sure your right we’re violated but we have no jurisdiction here. lol :) better luck next time?

I seriously don’t understand how these criminals are able to keep getting away with it"
GlocalBridge,"Let’s be clear. This is not an honest man who treasures democracy, but another wannabe dictator who is such a white supremacist that he wants to ban “woke.” I had enough of the shit he sells at Robert E. Lee High School. No thank you."
floofandmemes,He's been violating that amendment his entire office by constantly trying to punish speech he doesn't like.
was_and_wasnt,"Funny that Deathsantis (a republican) can remove an official we voted in when  he disagrees with that official and no republican backlash follows.

Equally funny that the Republican House can ignore the uproar over the seating of George Santos and allow him to be sworn in and given committee assignments when Santos has admitted to lying about everything in his life.

On one hand the republicans are saying that the will of the voters can be ignored when it suits their needs.  On the other hand republicans are saying the will of the voters can be ifollowed when it suits their needs.

And many wonder why we hate republicans so damn much.  They are literally the worst of us."
PineDude128,"Will he get punished for it though?

Will the elected official be reappointed?

Otherwise why does it matter? Republicans will continue to violate rights if they're not facing any repercussions"
Creed31191,Yet nothing will be done sadly.
Lucifurnace,"So i guess authoritarianism is just normal now? 

This “governor” is indistinguishable from whale shit."
Curious_Working5706,"TIL you can be a US Governor, violate the constitution and STILL keep your job.

No wonder these people seek to hold these positions, it’s like being a DictatorLite®️!"
Hockeyhoser,Reinstate the official or charge desantis then.
i-have-a-kuato,"Consequences,  trump didn’t experience any so why follow the rule of law if there won’t be any consequences?

It takes a large group of very special people to claim they are put upon by a “woke” radical left agenda who wants government out of their lives only to be told that you can’t use certain words, teach certain subjects, are banned from seeking out a few certain medical procedures as well as being told you can’t lower your energy costs.

One party wants to control voting and if it doesn’t go their way? well then that’s ok because insurrections and claims of incompetence will always be a tool. This is third world politics and unless there are consequences we are going to BE third world"
Nkdhobochoker,Guy needs to go….
grant0208,Doesn’t matter. The waffle-fry brained Florida republicans will double down saying “who cares? He should be getting rid of these democrats. Of course the courts run by the leftists are trying to make our hero look bad.”
andre3kthegiant,"The focus should not be on getting the job back, but punishing Desantis for trampling on a citizen’s rights."
PacificSun2020,"Adolf DeSantis, Führer of Florida."
CJ4ROCKET,"Republicans: We can't remove a duly elected official merely because he fabricated his entire resume, robbed a homeless veteran of money that would have otherwise saved his dying dog, and is under investigation for credibly being accused of stealing thousands of dollars.  The people have already spoken.

Also Republicans:"
EduardDelacroixII,"People who say Trump didn't accomplish anything are wrong.  

He proved to his Maga wannabe followers that you can lie, cheat and steal and there are no repercussions.   

DeSantis is just stealing pages from the Trump playbook - he is just ever so slightly less obnoxious about it. Slightly."
curious382,"How much of the Constitution must be violated for the injured party to be made whole?
""Tsk, tsk, that was naughty"" with no remedy for the rights violations seems inadequate."
twenty7w,">Today, Judge Hinkle upheld @GovRonDeSantis decision to suspend Andrew Warren from office for neglect of duty and incompetence,"" Taryn Fenske, DeSantis' communications director, tweeted.

Wait I thought he respected the 1st amendment?"
Butt_Putnam,"Does it matter in the fucking slightest when it will never be enforced on these traitorous pieces of shit?  Does it actually matter when they violate the constitution? Does it matter when they lie under oath? Does it matter when they commit human rights violations, or election fraud, or when elected officials are rapists?  We know that republicans are doing these things, they're doing it in broad daylight, and the best we get are officials recognizing that they did it, without so much as a hint of consequence.  Why do we care when judges rule that they violated the constitution if that's where it always stops?"
quest-to-know,Ron DeSantis hates freedom.
NeadNathair,"What was the point of the judge even saying anything if there's not going to be any effect from the ruling?

Oh, I'm sorry. There will be an effect. DeSeptictank now knows he can squash the Constitution and get away with it."
Malaix,"He fucks around and plays with expanding his governor powers all the time against the Florida constitution so why not with the American constitution? Its why I say he's one of the biggest fascists currently holding a major office in the US. He just does whatever he wants and does not give a shit about any rules or regulations he needs to break to do it. Like the gerrymandering he did? Wasn't in his power to do so. And his human trafficking stunts? Not in his power to move asylum seekers between states. And his don't say gay anti-woke laws? Blatantly anti-civil rights and free speech. Don't say gay is so vaguely worded you can literally read it as ""using basic English in schools means you can be sued.""

He has zero respect for any laws or rights that are in his way. And that is an extremely dangerous mentality."
esoteric_enigma,">Warren’s suspension will stand and he will have to plead his case before the Florida Senate, which will have final say on his potential return to office

Republicans hold the Florida senate 28-12. I don't think this is going anywhere."
Narrator-to-gods,He’s that shitty little kid on your block that would antagonize and start fights then run home to the safety of his front screen door knowing you couldn’t get him. Look at that shit grinned asshole and tell me you wouldn’t want to have five minutes alone with this punk.
jewwbs,"“Warren’s suspension will stand and he will have to plead his case before the Florida Senate, which will have final say on his potential return to office, NBC News reports.”

Welp good luck with that. DeFascist violates an elected officials Constitutional rights, and they still won’t get their job, for which they were elected, back.  Doesn’t seem corrupt AT ALL…"
AAA_4481,Further evidence that these people only care about the 2nd Amendment of the BoR.
like_a_wet_dog,"This crime is worse than some punk robbing a store. The robbery is scarier, more dangerous to the clerk at the moment, but these power crimes last longer and effect more people overall.

We need hard time for white collar POS's."
peon47,"He broke the law so he's going to jail, right? That's how it works?"
SadTaxifromHell,"From what I've learned about America lately, it doesn't matter if you violate the constitution when you're Republican. Has anyone actually faced real punishment?"
LudovicoSpecs,Fascists gonna fascist.
Scorpinock,DeSantis always smiles like he trusted a fart that he shouldn’t have.
flounder19,Kind of burying the lede here not to mention that the AG wasn't re-instated. Looks like he'll need a ruling from state court to actually win
HigherArchie,"And he'll suffer no consequences. And Republicans will not be questioned about this violation. And if they are they'll ignore it, while in private they will praise it. And Biden will continue to call for unity and will continue to insist the Republican party is not fully corrupt."
BallinArbiter,Everyone needs to realize that he is the problem now. This guy will make Trump look like a joke
PhantomLegend616,"This guy is like smart Trump. Trump was a POS, but he's very low IQ. A DeSantis presidency could be the worse thing to happen to America since Ronald Reagan."
ciccioig,"Just wait for the absolute zero consequences about this.

USA justice system is a joke."
Chevelle-72,Shit eating grin while fucking over Americans. But then again they are from Florida
Ntropy99,"Republicans only care about these things when they are directly affected, otherwise they won. There is no version where they see long term."
HumanRuse,"""Warren’s suspension will stand and he will have to plead his case before the Florida Senate, which will have final say on his potential return to office""

So basically the R controlled FL Senate will do nothing."
builderjoe12,Just throw that fucker in jail
DrownedinCats,And nothing will change.
jcouball,"> ""Today, Judge Hinkle upheld @GovRonDeSantis decision to suspend Andrew Warren from office for neglect of duty and incompetence,"" Taryn Fenske, DeSantis' communications director, tweeted

Only Republicans, the self appointed freedom party, would declare victory after having a judge declare they violated a person’s constitutional rights (both federal and state constitutions).

It would be nice if the judge issued a clarification."
liv2kik,Desantis is a violation to humanity
Erazerhead-5407,"How ironic that the party that complains the most about constantly losing their rights, the GOP Party, is the very one disposing of people’s rights."
doingwhaticanfornow,Now we all know the constitution doesn't apply to rich white politicians. They can do whatever they want and get away with it.
djean061,But he thinks he is God. One of the worst sins you can commit.
PaulMcKnight44,"Wait, this party, in this state, is violating basic human rights?! Color me shocked"
CreepyWhistle,"Goes to the Florida state Senate. 28 of 40 are Republican. Even if they don't side with DeSantis, they will make sure there's no consequence for it."
Buckowski66,"As with anything else, if there’s no punishment, then violations aren’t real, they are just someone saying “ shame on you!” With a wagging finger which is nothing."
,[deleted]
username675892,"I don’t get it, he signed a pledge to not enforce the law…seems like he should be fired. Just the sheriffs (also elected) in Illinois right now who are saying they won’t enforce the new gun control law. Your job is to enforce & prosecute the law, not to ignore the shit you don’t agree with."
Mental_Eggplant_8176,He’s a republican. There will be no consequences. They don’t believe in responsibility.
ca_agent,And what is the punishment for violating the Constitution?
Thesegsyalt,"He's broken so many felonies in the last year it's not even funny. From violating the first amendment to multiple isolated cases of kidnapping and human trafficking. He should be spending life in prison, not governing anything."
jancho0,So what happens now?
Dkm1331,"I truly think Florida is beginning it’s slow descent into Mississippi territory. Backwards thinking and education along with an economy that relies on working class transplants (18-30 year olds) who are showing less and less interest as a viable state to live in and when the retired boomers die off, who does the work for the locals?"
cultsuperstar,Kind of a sidenote but aren't Republicans trying to give the states the power to overrule the presidential election too? This just seems like a first step in them being able to just remove whomever they want.
Haunting-Ad788,If only conservatives gave a shit about the constitution.
catsareweirdroomates,">	“Today, Judge Hinkle upheld @GovRonDeSantis decision to suspend Andrew Warren from office for neglect of duty and incompetence,"" Taryn Fenske, DeSantis' communications director, tweeted.

Wow, what a blatant misrepresentation of this decision. It’s almost as if the DeSantis camp is slimy and underhanded!"
Half-Large,Too bad laws don’t apply to politicians anymore. Sure is a shame we’re all just sheep allowing them to do what they want
DamonRunnon,He'll violate a lot more if he gets the chance...
ExaltedRuction,"Florida Man violates constitution, wants to be president. News at 11."
kunren,"Ok but is he going to face charges this time?

It's not fucking funny anymore"
Eyemarten,"Back in 2015, I met him. Ronda Santis ‘accidentally’ kicked my dog, backed up and farted on my leg, and stuck me with a $45 bill at Denny’s. 

He can’t be trusted. Period."
Existing-Cherry4948,Can he just get fired from politics? Are there no legal repercussions for politicians like him?
lasttosseroni,"Biden should declassify all the awful things Desantis did at Guantanamo, there’s no way that dude didn’t get off on torturing folks."
Dumpster_slut69,Why do Republicans hate the constitution?
yodadamanadamwan,Weird that desantis is effectively taking a victory lap when he lost the ruling.
Pylgrim,"*a vocal and proud bigot gets banned from social media*

Republicans: ""mAh 1sT aMmEnDmEnT!""

*a republican openly violates the 1st amendment*

Republicans: ""so what?"""
Trying2Understand69,Ain’t no surprise there.  His Lieutenant Governor opposes free speech with a passion.
WeGotDaGoodEmissions,"Christina Pushaw, his press secretary, is one of the foulest creatures to come out of the dank conservative hole in a long time. She would make Goebbels smile with fondness. One of the top Republican propagandist mouthpieces in the country."
Racine262,"DeSantis still won and declared victory. The prosecutor has to go before the Florida Senate to get his job back.
So, DeSantis' firing will stand. There was no outcome to this that DeSantis was going to actually lose. 
The elected prosecutor won't be returning to work."
ilya46,"Easy, remove that judge as well"
Beantownbrews,Tomorrow’s news: DeSantis bans AP American Politics exam from Florida schools
ismyusername,Can voters in the district sue DeSantis for violating their rights?
nenulenu,But what are the consequences? Does he lose the office? No. Why would he care what he is violating? He will do it again.
eljefeinjax,"Of course the prosecutor can't be reinstated so Desantis camp is already spinning it like it's a win, who cares if constitutional rights were violated"
DramaticWesley,Shouldn’t breaking a constitutional amendment come with heavy repercussions?  Or am I just being too much of a snowflake?
Wild_Score_711,"He doesn't care. Even if the US Supreme Court ordered him to reinstate the prosecutor, he wouldn't. He violated our state Constitution by drawing new election maps himself & gerrymandering our state even more. He took 2 predominently Black Democratic districts and broke them up into 4 prodominently white Republican districts and his hand picked Supreme Court let him get away with it. He wants to be POTUS so he's pandering to TFG's base as well as Moms for Liberty only for those who agree with them and every bigot in the state & country."
Diamond4100,I feel like if you are the Governor and you violate your state’s constitution then that should be grounds for impeachment.
2Quick_React,Come talk to me whenever he receives consequences for it. Otherwise this means nothing.
Driftwood1884,This guy is ten times more dangerous than Trump. If he ever gets out of Florida and into D.C. there’s going to be real trouble. His tactics are totally communist/dictator if you ask me.
IcyBoysenberry9570,And the hot take here is.. *so?*  It's not like he'll have any consequence for breaking the law.  He's a wealthy conservative.
udders,">""Today, Judge Hinkle upheld @GovRonDeSantis decision to suspend Andrew Warren from office for neglect of duty and incompetence,"" Taryn Fenske, DeSantis' communications director, tweeted.


No, no he didn't.  He literally ruled that DeSantis violated the 1st Amendment ***AND*** the Florida State Constitution, but said that other federal laws prevented him from giving the guy his job back.  The tweet from DeSantis team highlights *the Governor's* incompetence!"
M2D2,It’s not really illegal if nothing happens when you do it.
Thetimmybaby,Consequences or No?
CoMmOn-SeNsE-hA,And nothing will happen smh
tacticalcop,good! now get rid of him!
GioWindsor,What can he be charged with for doing that?
Past_Kaleidoscope_28,"And absolutely nothing will happen to him because he has an R.

If he was a D the full force of the law would've wollap him and the DNC would force him to resign.

But both sides are the same right?"
xxxxx420xxxxx,"He's off by one amendment, if he wanted to really get anyone's attention"
McBain_v1,"And once again, sod all will happen."
quesadilla79,he sucefully removed an elected official and all he got was harsh language from a judge.
MentalOperation4188,He doesn’t care. He will do it again. Laws don’t matter to him.
Anxious_Tax_5624,Republicans stopped caring about the Constitution long ago. They say they love it but shit on it daily.
EmperorsCanaries,He violated the constitution and there will be no consequences and no recourse. The rich and powerful yet again live by a completely different sets of rules. The US justice system is a joke
kanemano,all of DeSantos's announcements get over turned by the courts silently
lab-gone-wrong,">Warren’s suspension will stand and he will have to plead his case before the Florida Senate, which will have final say on his potential return to office, NBC News reports.

Then this is useless"
manningthehelm,"Party of small government eh? By small, they mean remove everyone else but themselves….."
stay_fr0sty,That judge *does* rule.
EminentBean,"What a lying, corrupt POS"
cwood1973,"DeSantis is smart enough to understand what he's doing. He knows removing elected officials is unconstitutional, but he doesn't care because he knows he won't face consequences for his actions. Meanwhile, the right wing base drools over this kind of authoritarian, fascist, bullshit."
idontexist_ignoreme,"If he is the candidate, it would be “hat trick” (three in a row) for Republican party nominating idiots - Bush, Trump and DeSantis."
Utterlybored,You know DeSantis loves the publicity! And he knows there will be no legal consequences because they don’t happen to Republicans.
Mad102190,"Not only will the elected official who was removed not be reinstated, but DeSantis won’t even face any consequences for violating his rights. 

What was the whole point of this investigation then?"
Oseirus,"K.

Wake me up when he's actually found guilty on trial. 

Or literally any political figure is found guilty on trial. I don't care what party they answer to, if they've committed a crime then make them accountable. 

""Judge rules"". ""Experts say"". ""Analysts confirm"". All these buzzwords and fluffy headlines that vanish in the river before the sun even sets, nothing ever changes."
Verrence,"Great!  I can’t wait to see all of the consequences Desantis will face!

What?  There will definitely be zero consequences?  Well *shit*."
sonny9636,Watch in a couple years people in the state will be wondering where their rights have gone. Why do they keep voting for this moron? They are choosing hate over freedom.
guyfromthepicture,He knows and he fully intends to have this ultimately fail so he can point to government overreach and excessive wokeness as some part of deep state boogie man to terrify his base into sucking him off.
SnooMacaroons8650,im sure there will be reprecutions
Salsashark_21,And the penalty for that is…… nothing.
jal262,This man doesn't care about the constitution.  He's a lawyer.  He understands what is and isn't legal.  It's just about convincing the Right that he is a social warrior that they can support as a presidential candidate.
gideon513,Is there a consequence for doing that?
BetrayYourTrust,And I suppose that means… nothing is going to happen
weezy_latez,Inb4 they say first amendment is a sham and should be changed
greengiant333,So what happens now? He gets a stern warning and a fine?
Hot-Career-5669,Getting the DeSantis attacks in early won't help stop him. He's going to steamroll the primary for the GOP and the dems don't have a single young likeable candidate.
davesreddit123,"Hopefully, the decision gets appealed, because the Judge laid put exactly how the firing was an unlawful violation of the first amendment and then ruled in DeSantis's favor by stating DeSantis's would have fired Warren anyway for a different reason. 

The ruling really lays out how the firing was all based on right-wing media and conspiracy talking points and DeSantis's wanting to get free media coverage. It's listed in the ruling that DeSantis's office knew exactly how much free media coverage the firing generated in the following 14 days, $2.4 million."
LawfulnessClean621,"Things will turn violent at this rate. Its like 2nd amendment dipshits wanted to prove we needed guns to prevent fascist, so they became fascists. 

I think when it comes down to it, it will get bloody faster from the other side."
tallboy68tree,"Floridian here and people love him. I see bumper stickers everywhere that say “DeSantis 2024 /Make America Florida” 

He’s an awful human being."
TonyManhattan,Axios seriously wrote a whole article with that title and buried that the court let the decision stand at the end. Pathetic journalism.
greenielove,">“The Eleventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from awarding declaratory or injunctive relief of the kind at issue against a state official based only on a violation of state law,” the judge ruled.

But the First Amendment is federal."
TheSeekerOfSanity,An empty shell.
Belkroe,So what is DeSantis’s punishment. I am a teacher and if I violate one of my student’s right especially as blatantly and this douche bag did I would be fired. If there is no punishment then what stops him from doing it again?
M-V-P623,So he’s going to get in trouble right? …..right?
justbrowse2018,Dude is high out of his mind everytime I see him does anyone not notice too s?
botglm,I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: this man looks like he is always taking a hangover shit.
Sugarbombs,Can't wait to see there be 0 repercussions
pcs8416,"I know why the 11th Amendment exists, and I'm sure this rule is to prevent some truly disruptive things, but in this case, this is some nonsense: “The Eleventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from awarding declaratory or injunctive relief of the kind at issue against a state official based only on a violation of state law,”"
fullmetal66,Desantis is quickly climbing my dream list of people to slap.
Bobmanbob1,But no consequences.
BuckyFnBadger,"And let me guess, nothing will happen to him."
Templar388z,"I’ll be surprised if anything happens to
him legally in this pussy ass country."
