Interesting-Switch38,Nice shots I would’ve shit myself if I were you
HUNDarkTemplar,"Guy wasnt even hiding It, but I guess he didnt have money for god mode cheat. Fckers ruin the game"
ShinyRayquazaEUW,Disgusting
StealthCatUK,Interesting choice of armour and weapons for you though.
V4ALIANT,"night raids are crawling with them, so not only in this game do we need to deal with thermals we get to deal with cheaters. Sneaky immersive night runs are officially ruined and a complete gamble with your gear."
Schxdxnfrxxdx,He's not a cheater that's just EoD edition giving him a very slight advantage bro come on /s
SaborW,"Cheaters always ruin the game and they don't give a shit. Ruining the game is the entire point for most of them.  I remember when cheating in online games was unheard of, but then they just showed up. And they never, ever, ever, ever, said a word.  At least they still felt shame back then.   Watching people jump 1000 feet into the air in Delta Force and unload the double ammo load of 40mm grenades without needing to reload.  So stupid"
Soulcaller,"AM adamant who is denying the cheater infestation here in reddit are the cheaters or has ties with them... no ways people just come here and say skill issue or ur positioning was bad, when evidence presents it self in 4k video format 10 times a day ... clownfiesta, yesterday watched couple of streamers shroud landmark Desi, got annihilated raid after raid by cheaters with warmage, ps ammo etc... fuck lighthouse is literally unplayable, shoreline same, even customs was fucked. Dont know what's going on, but glad am quit playing long time..."
jasonalloyd,If everyone keeps spamming cheater video after cheater video here maybe they will get around to doing something about it. But probably not.
blradj,"he is not a cheater, just a good gamer headset"
Bradur-iwnl-,This is the weirdest clip i have ever seen. Your whole loadout is just confusing xd. Paca with that gun. BETA container. 20 round mags. helmet with headset. Its bizzare and i like it!!
DatboiBazzle,"Enemy was spraying while hitting every round using a ak74u drum mag with iron nights, using 5,45 ps, his friend run up no audio on my 2nd team mate full auto hit every shot then pushed me and i luckly got a lucky shot"
LiquidFrost,"cheating aside for one second, please God go to the *health* tab when you're seriously injured and fix the bleeds first, then the thorax! The way you started healing gave me anxiety. 

That being said, let's get some Valorant Vanguard level anti cheat at this point I don't care how invasive the anti cheat is the game is being ruined"
DWLKJR,Notice how this post isn't getting likes. The cheaters are down voting it
fongletto,"Shoreline was a horrible experience. I had like 7-8 raids in a row to cheaters after not seeing any all the whole wipe.

I think all the labs cheaters have filtered down into shoreline and lighthouse."
whaterz1,"Yeah I have over 1500 hours 4th wipe here and I notice a cheater maybe once every 10 raids, out of the 100+ I have done. Way higher than before where you might see a handful per wipe"
iceblaze93,Even the previous wipe was almost unplayable on Sundays. And when I made a comment on Shoreline being a cheater infested hell I was downvoted to oblivion. And now the frontpage is full of clips where people got cheated on.
BigChowderr,not cheating he has the battle pass
Infinitykiddo,how did the cheater  died  to you then?
CorvusEffect,"Every time I go to night time shoreline, it's been super suspicious, but that's the only map that's been weird for me."
Cuckbeard,"I love bringing my nice stuff to a raid and then getting full auto lasered in the head while i'm prone behind cover, really adds to the immersion"
Scavwithaslick,Bro cms’d before healing the bleed while at 50 hp
StellarReality,I mean a company that can't even make an audio for being out of breath without having studio background noise filter in isn't gonna be able to do much to stop cheaters lmfao.
BchSV_FAN,"this patch is probably the worst, tired of silent F-1 grenades exploding over my head almost every raid. never seen that shit before. 

nikiturd dropped the ball hard with this patch."
SenseiDecay,I've seen a lot of cheaters in this game but where in this clip is the cheating evidence?  Guy didn't even kill the guy in paca and missed most of his shots and didn't see him flying around or doing anything sus.
soulsentinel37,"It's the RMT. Ignorant kids buying ruble packs from 3LiT3gAyMeRz.com that have a cyber cafe full of kids with hack clients, farming the game. It's actually been shown that these kids working at the cyber cafes make decent money, too! They can literally feed their families and buy homes while the business can afford hardwareID spoofers and enough web proxy services that, when they do get banned, it's just considered another ""cost of doing business"" and they log back into alt-account #824 
Now, with region locking in the game, this has been nipped in the bud fairly successfully, but out of the animosity that the RMTers left behind the NA servers are experiencing a wave of ""salty timmy's"" kids who got burned in previous wipes by hackers are now seeking out the hacks themselves, spawning entire underground discord communities packed full of eager timmys ready to give out mommys credit card to jim, some programmer out of pheonix, AZ who works a remote IT job paying 95k annual with decent health benefits and a nice retirement package (good stock options too!) But, ya see, jim is mad he actually didn't break that "" 6 figure status"" and he feels a little resentful over his past history with video games, where his older pot-smoking brother would dog on him as a little kid and ""git gud"" was a verbal insult constantly thrown in his face....
So now jim hears about this game, full salty timmys, screaming git gud, and then also realizes it's an alpha-project. Implying that their will be ""holes in the code"" so jim dies his homework, spends about a month designing a nice shell and GUI concept for a cheat client.... 3 months later and now jim has about "" 1500 subscribers"" and an active growing cheat community.

TLDR; Sorry for the wild tangent, but the rabbit hole is deep, and because real money got involved... this issue is only growing... never dying..."
Daggarin,Tbh 90% of the time my deaths are head/eyes and I don't know whether I'm extremely unlucky or the cheating is at a whole new level this wipe
HeavyMetalHero,"I just can't understand how cheaters fail to get these kills sometimes.   Like, you literally know exactly where everyone is and can spawn bullets inside their face hitbox, how do you fuck that up?"
yetanotherjared,"If he was a cheater you’d be dead, right?  What cheat does he have?  You’re on the hill good chance you had a pretty clear silhouette."
Raikohhh,"Do the maths on how much money BSG is getting every times they do sales, every 3 months, convert that from USD to ROUBLE.

It's never gonna end, Arena will be the same."
Sour_Mashed,"What am i missing? You've got a lvl 1 head and 2 chest, and you're alive."
SnorinMac,"He probably was just shooting at your nvg glare. You had no face cover if he was cheating you'd be dead.

He also didn't shoot you in the head at all. You did not get any contusions."
hooblyshoobly,"Your loadout makes no sense, are you new or trolling yourself? I'm unsure."
matt3decker,"I agree cheaters suck, but every raid? That’s a bit of a stretch"
NoInformation1632,So the guy beamed you from across the map where the aksu that's definitely not evidence of any type of cheating the fact that you call it out the moment that you hear it I don't believe you dude. Maybe he has different settings and better post effects than you do when you're wearing the nvg. You know that there's a slight glow in your character's face which makes you pop out?
suburban09,U don't even TRY to get cover wtf :D
FlyPenFly,"Wow got him anyway, nice."
Gun_Genie_Sk8,Gotta respect a fellow beta gamer
SOXLstan,"its always shoreline, woods, or lighthouse rn"
EngineeringTofu,Who has had the unlimited nade thrower yet in factory? Killed his ass but he killed my team and the best part was he wasn't wearing a tac rig.
ExoticPerception6,"What do you even say at this point, same shit every wipe.  Shoreline and Lighthouse cheater haven for another wipe."
nudel96,Same here
NotSliver,Skill issue
MoonmansDisciple,"Just a warning, I'm pretty sure sunglasses still give you away by just being extremely bright. They may have fixed it, but if you've been spotted alot recently and you use sunglasses, maybe swap off em."
Ajt0ny,What's that status icon above Light bleeding? Never seen that before and I can't find it on the wiki.
Elduroto,how'd you make your scope like that?
Rip_n_Toot26,"I got head eyes on the little island near the tunnel extract at night by a guy at port office with iron sights, felt a little off put from that raid won't lie, up until last night it wasn't tok bad on my side, pretty pleasnt sailing"
Rat_Eye_Moody,Yeah shoreline at night is basically unplayable since the labs card change on flea
SimDaddy14,The insured half mask saved you man
NemoSHill,What maps are they most common in? I've only died to one so far in Dorms
SoveitBudgie,What scope is that?
ramlol,"Cheaters are so common on OCE it's getting pretty sad. Shoreline + Reserve is a 50/50 of getting a cheater.

Give everyone labs cards again so they can all go make that a cesspool or get some pmods like runescape who get priority to refer people. 

I report every cheater I've run into but I feel like it does absolutely nothing."
Xecuto,"yep, absolutely unplayable"
Responsible-Cloud744,he just has a better gaming char smh
lbigbirdl,Your mcx build is pretty swag tho
zenheizer,"Open the health tab! Stop the bleedings! Cheater aside, this gave me anxiety. Using the CMS before stopping the bleed..."
D4tABo1i,Nice to see others using the freelook glitch
YungR29,Why level 2 armor with crazy kit? You are asking to get killed
LordSaladz,My first rule of dealing with cheaters if I can't get away: lay down! Helps a lot if they have aim bot set to thorax. Nice shots on your part though.
majorbeefy130130,Cheater not just paying for God mode like if your gona be blatant be blatant. SMH oh wait he prolly isn't gona be banned at least not this wipe
zarial6,"Dude, I didn't even watch the clip and I can say straight away that you're bad at the game and you need to stop whining. There are no cheaters in the game and bsg is not ignoring on purpose all these flea market deals with 10+ ledx on barter."
gladbmo,"Pain med first, so you shut your character up, then med up. Also pain med will allow you to not die suddenly."
DaBawks,At least you live
tylert69,I don't even see the fun in it.
Ibrenecairo,Respect for using the Free-look ADS Bug
Ghost_Rider09,"Whatvis this ""aim""?"
Ok-Street-7240,Cheaters are not a joke. BSG is a joke.
Twenty-Three23,Mcx is my favorite gun by far. I love using it. Sounds and feels good. God i wish it was better and they didnt fuck the recoil.
Sin-Daily,That's not a scav?
C0rrupt_M0nk3y,They're all complete dogshit too. It's even more demoralizing when your boy kills the guy and you have to wonder if he really was cheating or if there was some crazy desync. They're full rage hacking yet they'll sit in a corner and teleport grenades to you because they don't want to look sus. Even though anyone with any significant hours in the game can immediately tell they're cheating.
D12F3AR,Just played 3 raids and died in all 3 to cheaters on Shoreline.... EU Servers
SuperRektT,XD
ToeJamLickerMan,"Dang you really pulled that off with a Paca???   
Impressive..."
Tommy_OneFoot,JFC they turned you into a chicken nugget.
SUNTZU_JoJo,Are you camping Fishermen quest spot for SBIH and PACA kills?
Comander_Praise,"Damn I hate cheaters in this game I'm thankful I never run into any, I had one questionable death this wipe from a pmc a very strange head eyes shot. Besides that I had one two wipes ago that killed me and my two team mates instantly and we where in different rooms lol

Besides that I don't encounter any and I touch wood to keep it that way"
Hot_Juice_3279,"Rat, no knowledge about healing and interesting  (?) Equipment wann talk about cheaters?... ;-)"
suburban09,"Don't get the hate. It's a cheater, why not run away?"
Drpeppercalc,"Sucks for yall, i've been chilling on US West servers. Zero cheaters encountered since about 2 years ago."
PoperzenPuler,I know something like this only from videos... which server region?
_Bike_seat_sniffer,"My workaround was playing on US East instead of EU because it's further away from China, guess what?"
NeverLace,"What servers are you playing on?

Im playing on EU and Ive possibly seen one hacker so far."
Demonic_Corp,"You probably should have stopped your bleeds before surgery, but other than that, you did your best and did decent shots. Fuck all cheaters at any degree"
SlaveDeMorto,"People who passionately defend Tarkov be like:

Where are the other 39 minutes of the raid you could have shot him before so he knew where you were? And how can we trust you that he had iron sights were are the screenshots!?!?"
dorpdrop,"Literally killed one the other day. Admittedly I was very dirty, down in d2, heard someone coming back through the tunnel room, mate closed the door to the hallway and I got ready with vog. As soon as it was opened, I lob nade, he starts shooting the wall. He ends up dead. Checking the body my man was running a killa helmet with packa armor and a 100 drum mag ak. Not saying he can’t be legit, but that’s the weirdest combo I’ve seen early wipe on this game"
mikek1993,Why do we think this guy is cheating? You shot him first he never spots you before your muzzle flash. Then he lights you up and doesn't hit a single head shot? This isn't a cheater.
