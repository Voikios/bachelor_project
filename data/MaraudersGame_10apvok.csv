benfml,Heavy frigate too FYI ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
terrencethetomato,"The worst part about these crashes is that your body disappears too so noone else can loot your stuff either so your equipment just poofs into the aether. 

I would've loved to find that that get up laying about"
Mythicguy,"Died to a heart attack (random death, no shots) with full panzer, several jewelry boxes, war bonds, Gucci tommy and interceptor a few days ago. 

I feel ur pain. üòî"
Sweet-Possession-849,OoF yeh shit like this makes me re think bringing out the L1A1
musicalpain,Yup! I submitted a ticket asking for this exact thing. This has happened to me twice in my meager like 10 hours of playtime.
hull657,"rip my man - me and my friends will come back to play this when it's more stable, just stings too badly sometimes, we're back on Hunt The Showdown and loving it"
KRS12368,"This has happened to me 4 times in a row, or the panzer rig I have in my storage will just insta spawn in my inventory on top of my other armor, and I will have to leave and disconnect from the game like 4 times to get it back"
Squirrelleh,Oof...sorry for your loss! What map was this on? Was it Terraformer?
Additional_Low_5606,"Yeah seriously you can't have a game like this that doesn't have reconnect. Even the god damn Dark and Darker playtest had reconnect and they don't even have a proper friends system yet. It makes no sense, just leave my character there and if I get shot while I'm gone, so be it that sucks but to just not have a reconnect with a game with this amount of crashing is stupid and needs to be addressed."
skyhc,"Luckily in my 60 hours in the game this hasn't happened to me. But, it did happen to my buddy when we were playing together. Shot him and brought back almost all his loot"
itsjambles,Before the red baron update I honestly only had 2 crashes once within my first 2 or 3 days and then my last maybe 1 week after but nothing too crazy and then this update I had experience 6 freaking crashes 2 on terraformer once in a firefight with another marauder and he didn't kill me I didn't get the death screen like mid shot the entire game just disconnects I really feel like they need to focus less on adding content now and just getting things stable again
MountainMan9712,Yea it hurts pain of playing a hard-core looter shooter early on....the game straight up deleted my red baron ship from my hanger before I had a chance to even use it
SolidSufficient2668,Also happened to me yesterday with the jackhammer rig it‚Äôs aids
