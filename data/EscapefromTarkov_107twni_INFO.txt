{"Title": "Another novel idea: how about instead of removing LPVOs from traders because everyone uses them, you give us that second iteration of the scope overhaul you promised a year and a half ago so people branch out to different sights?", "Post Text": "Yeah, remember that? [Remember how one guy did a bunch of overhauls for the forbidden mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/oc6var/hi_i_am_the_creator_of_the_recent_optic_rework/) and everybody was initially convinced it was BSG's work? Remember how Nikita said they would do a more in-depth overhaul and it would be way better, blah blah blah? Yeah, come 2023, still nothing other than a bunch of low-tier red dots being made smeary.
