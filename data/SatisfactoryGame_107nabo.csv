GamingPizza859,"If your factory works well enough, is original enough and looks nice enough, I’d say you made a sick factory anyway."
Outrageous_Zebra_221,TBH I think a lot of people come here looking for people to tell them it's okay if their starter area looks like a spaghetti bowl after they watched some youtube video where the author spent endless time and effort making everything look clean.
Fyzzle,"I want to see pictures of the worst supercomputer factory that still works.

You know what would be cool?  Terrible Tuesdays, where people post spaghetti factories."
Strikox,"""Comparison is the thief of joy""

I love this quote, as long as you had fun building and you were proud of you once it was finished then it all that matters ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)"
sci-goo,"It's the engineering be like. Since engineering is always about trade-offs and usually one can not achieve everything, therefore he can always see others' shining points but forgets that he also achieved something others don't."
Adezar,"Lol, I try to avoid the subreddit of a game before I start playing to start blind, built up some semi-functional factories, even including a train... then came here and was like 'well, damn'."
realamericanhero2022,"I build my factory for performance, not looks. Sometimes I organize belts just to keep from awkwardly jumping over things, other times it looks like I’m flying through a trench in the Death Star."
818488899414,I figure my first playthrough will be to see what it takes to make it work. The next one will be let's see what it takes to make it work and look decent. After that? Who knows.
PeterTheFoxx,I relate to this so hard. I know that as long as you're having fun and that you enjoyed what you made then you're valid and stuff. But I badly want my builds to look as good as some of the ones here and it's really demoralising to see that what you make just doesn't look as good in comparison
W34kness,Your spaghetti is beautiful and the tower can be bigger!
ItzYaBoiPS,"I have built a conveyor belt wall over my starter base, and as unoptimized as it is, I love it and it’s mine"
h_ahsatan,"My factory is pure spaghetti. I tried making one organized building and it took too long so I didn't make another. I mostly didn't even bother with foundations. All four pieces for phase 4 are automated, just a matter of time and maybe speeding it up a bit now. Live free, spaghetti hard."
The_WolfieOne,"Sooooo feel this. Then I recognize It’s only been about a month and a half and realize there’s so much more to learn and discover and get all excited again.
Actually whooped out loud when the relationship between overflow on a smart splitter and production efficiency became clear.
It’s a rich, rich game, loving it. Props to the Devs!"
25nameslater,Is this after watching let’s game it out and realizing he still built a better factory?
goat4209,My clean factory means it starts off even in one end of the room and slowly becomes spaghetti
themarknessmonster,"Good thing it's not a beauty competition, Pioneer.  If it works, it looks good enough!"
Darklordofbunnies,"It's only Dedication if it's from the Dedicae region of France, otherwise it's just sparkling autism."
KYO297,After nearly 1000 hours I no longer have that problem
Shag_Nasty_McNasty,I’m more of a minimalist.
lilibat,I spent last night de-carbing two of my factories because I had just thrown the machines up to see how big the building needed to be and the mess was stressing me out.
Quajeraz,Just check out LGIO and you'll immediately feel good about yourself.
Dalearnhardtseatbelt,Attacked
michimonster2,"My ""factory"" literally only produces every resource once, so extremly uneffecitve. 

But i dump a lot of thing in the sinks. 

So much, that i had to upgrade my sink line to 4 sinks by now"
Equivalent_Cicada153,Get the same feeling when I unlock a new tier
pyritesidiot,I know it's not perfect or well organized but it works and its mine damit lol
nlamber5,"A lot of other players build extremely clean factories, but when I see them I’m just thinking “wow that a lot of unneeded geometry for a computer to render”"
Woodontherun,"I just got done a partial rebuild, I realized I went too fancy for being at the end of phase 2. I think I have to tear it down and redo it.... again."
rxforyour7,"I see people post their factories on here and I'm like ""I have a potato for a brain, don't I?"""
TheBostonKremeDonut,"Hobbies are hobbies. As long as you have fun, it’s all that matters!

Some people just love to Min/max!"
deathisadoorway,"My factory is good enough, and smart enough, and doggonit, people like it."
Mr_Builder132,"Honestly, I would love to see more bases like [mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/xdq6fo/rate_my_100_efficient_base/) on this subreddit, because I love the style of absolute chaos"
Vencam,"The world is a big place, with many talented people...

Also asian kids."
