Neyar_Yldan,"You could also try placing foundations over the node. Theoretically, if the crate sticks out above the foundation you should get the loot prompt instead of targeting the node"
GhostZero00,"If any Satisfactory developer read this...

It's possible to make this boxes be like a building? So we press F and dismantel them

This way if there is many boxes, we can just dismantel all same time, without need to open, transfer..."
MeltsYourMinds,Uhm… satisfactory calculator probably
fishcakerun,"[https://ficsit.app/mod/OrganizedCrates](https://ficsit.app/mod/OrganizedCrates)

A small mod that collects all those boxes that get left everywhere. I feed this collection box into my storage to be sorted again."
KishoreXD,Load your save File into Satisfactory Calculator  ->  interactive map. If you hover/Click on that Crate in the interactive map you can delete from there.  and after download that save file and replace the one in the saved files location.
KYO297,"You can try different angles, it may be possible to pick it up. If not, you can use the satisfactory interactive map. From there I'm pretty sure you could delete it, maybe even move it. If you've got something important in there (like hard drives), place a storage container somewhere close, you can then spawn items into it"
outerspacemannn,I don’t know how to remove it. But you can hide it by building a 4m foundation over it. Your miner will snap to the foundation and still work
TaeganRiles,"Until Coffee Stain fixes the hit boxes on resource nodes, the easiest (and possibly only) way to recover these loot boxes is to upload your save file to [https://satisfactory-calculator.com/en/interactive-map](https://satisfactory-calculator.com/en/interactive-map) and edit the loot box position to raise it up by a few meters.

Then you can download your modified save and collect the loot box in game."
Medricel,"They really need to make the permanent ores (and creature corpses) have the *lowest* selection priority when a player puts their crosshair over it.

Too many times have I killed creatures inhabiting some ore patches and been unable to collect their drops because the ore patch takes priority."
Loose-Eye-6945,"This problem occurs because the box is in a layer (logical, not graphic) below the caterium deposit. So the logic of the game prioritizes that you collect caterio before the box."

\^ Covered your solution. To go a little more in depth. [Go Here](https://satisfactory-calculator.com/en/interactive-map) , Load your map into the interactive map, find crate, move it so you can get it or delete it."
CaptainCriminality,Use satisfactory calculator. You can remove the chest or relocate it to still get the insides of the chest
ASillyPupper,"Go to the Satisfactory Calculator/Interactive map. Then upload the game file and modify the position of the crate to be like 1-2M higher.
Then reload the save and pick it up."
Aramuss,Crouch and try from the side?
The_redstone_rob0t,You need to attend your own funeral
twohedwlf,Have you tried pressing e?
GaffJuran,This kind of crate should disappear when it’s empty. You get into it the same way you would any crate.
Cootshk,Crouch so that you’re not looking at the caterium
Crystalysism,When I first took a quick glance at this picture I thought it was real life. Don’t ask me why but I didn’t make the connection is was an in game screen lol
Ipokedhitler,Have you trying using a hover pack to go out of range of the node but still in range to access the crate? u/Green_Submarine7965
Last_Distance_7602,There is a mod which combines all crates into one
Gonemad79,"There's the autoloot mod. Empty your inventory in boxes on your base and go back to this box. The ore will be picked up, then the box will be available."

unbakedbreadboi,Have you tried pressing and holding E?
jim_the-gun-guy,Clear a space in your invent and hit E. That will pick up the materials and remove the crate.
python_artist,"Is this in the Northern Forest, by chance? If so, I have a portable miner stuck in the same spot."
Sirus_S_Solari,I would like to suggest explosives….
TheArstotzkanGuard,Hold E
TwinSong,If you have free space in your inventory shouldn't E do it?
Shadow_Leviathan_375,Yes. press and hold E
