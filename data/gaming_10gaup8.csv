IforgotwhatIwasdoing,This game might actually get me to finally upgrade my PC.
Jolt_91,What is the order to play the Stalker games in?
GTmgbr,Here are the other screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/5h7pQx4
MajinBuuMan,"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is the Euro-jank Dark Souls version of Fallout 3/NV.

And I loved every game.  Even more than Metro (some of the same devs worked on Metro 2033).  Really interested to see how this one turns out."
similar_observation,"RIP S.T.A.L.K.E.R development team member Volodymyr Yezhov, who was killed by a Russian artillery strike last December."
Stoly23,"I was really excited when this game was first revealed, and I never would have guessed it would wind up being delayed by a fucking Russian invasion of all things. Glad to see development is still moving along despite everything, –°–ª–∞–≤–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ."
Realcbear,Slava Ukraini :( RIP to the devs we lost
NoContactGurl2,"Sorry, never played STALKER: are all games set in Chernobyl/surrounding areas?"
herehaveallama,‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏è
astrongineer,"""Screenshots"" is plural."
reyc01987,Hoping the ui can be turned off. Also hoping it does like metro or farcry 2 style in world menus‚Ä¶like pulling out a physical compass for instance
DigitalWellbeing,"Is it worth playing Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl in 2023 and which mods would you, nerds, recommend?"
,[deleted]
mrmasturbate,honestly all it needs is for the modding tools to be excellent so the community will fix any shortcomings the game has :P
ryannoahm450,Please be optimized on lunch
FlameyCassie,"Damn.
I'm lucky I've ordered a Series X now."
ComplexComfortable48,I'm going to get a new PC just for this.
Salvia_McLovin,Ah nu! Cheeki breeki i v damke!
TryingToEscapeTarkov,Looks good. Please don't suck.
AnimZero,"Really looking forward to this. Hell, I bet the development of this game alone is quite the story."
Reddit_User_9011,"Ah yes, a completely unedited screenshot‚Ä¶"
Sabbathius,"I'm currently playing Into the Radius, which is basically Roadside Picnic in VR, and it's such a blast. Can't wait for this game to release, I just desperately need it to be good! Metro Exodus was excellent, but not quite hit the same nerve as Stalker did."
Verto-San,All I can say is that orange looks kinda Sus.
droppinkn0wledge,"Friendly reminder to read *Roadside Picnic*, a classic of science fiction that directly inspired these games."

Exit727,"cool.

game when?"
Ozi_izO,"For someone who doesn't really get excited for game releases any more I'm actually really looking forward to this one releasing.

Looks like a hoot."
Cyclops1i2u,glad to finally see more from it! hope it‚Äôll have just as extensive of a modding scene as the old games did. stalker anomaly and gamma were a blast!
Kofu,"I remember playing the first S.T.A.L.K.E.R game with my friend, lost contact now but I will always remember our experience playing it. 

We didn't have the best PC as individuals but we joined our forces to create a half decent amalgamation. we made a go of it, but still had random crashes, so quick save was at easy hand.

To be honest I had a great time playing this way, made it extra nerve-wracking. Almost as if it was part of the games environment.

Such a great game and I am looking forward to the next chapter."
vannostrom,I upgraded a few weeks ago for this and Starfield. I'm ready let's go!
Deechon,"There are not that many upcoming games I'm excited for, but this is one of those exceptions."
Kay_Guy,Among us
Husker_Kyle,How‚Äôs the first one play?
kokko693,"Let's just stop care about graphics... Its something that should stop.

People always love graphics and trailers, but when they have the game, what they rant about is the gameplay.

I just don't care. I want gameplay. Shiny graphics are just bait."
peteyd2012,"*glances at 1080*

You can do this buddy, trust me ü•∫"
hakzeify,"The game will look nothing like this, and have 10x less vegitation"
deftoast,Yoooo they got red AmongUs guy in the game. Best crossover.
platyhooks,Resist all hype. You have been hurt before...
G8KK0U,Looks more like Ubisotf magic they use at E3. The trailer they've released 3 weeks ago looked pretty awesome but not anywhere near this kind of level.
StepBruh69,No holes in the screen?
PCGamerjunkie,why do thry make the trailers to games and amazing and high quality then when they release they most of the time become downgraded now im not hating on developers but come on man give us a game that looks like the trailer and is a fun as they say i mean look at when skyrim released that was next gen epic i love gaming as a hole so pls devs we beg of you to release the next skyrim game with the same motivation of og skyrim or even better yet lots more
SunBrosRus,Too bad the one of the stalker devs died in ukraine :/
Number-Thirteen,Can't fucking wait.
Danominator,Color me interested. Especially if it's coop
Elitesabaton69,This game looks pretty. Hope it holds up o the classics in gameplay.
CodyRyan86,Screenshot*
KrowJob,"Jesus, this game is gonna be terrifying"
SpiderGhost01,"Great screenshot! I need to buy this game, assuming it‚Äôs on Xbox."
Liesthroughisteeth,"Jackfrags just released [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV_bpgWRXiQ) on this. :)

Have the original and just finishing up a new PC build, so will be looking forward to this. :)"
heiwywsbwkueeg, Requirements?
Obie_186,Can't wait to play this game in a few years when I finally save up enough money to be able to buy a decent PC (before people jump in telling me how cheap it is to buy decent parts at a decent price I live in a third-world country)
stuckpixel87,Still remember when i looked at screenshots from the original one as a kid. Can‚Äôt wait for the new one.
Key-Pomegranate159,its the unfulfilled teenage love besides the friendzoned one!!!
ElJefe543,"I plan on buying it simply to support a Ukrainian company. If it's good, awesome fantastic, I look forward to playing it. If it's not good then........whatever I still supported a Ukrainian company. I'm going to buy it one way or the other."
lol_treez,BLYAAAAAAAAaaaa‚Ä¶looks amazing!!
Gobius,"Press ""X"" to sprint!"
barabara4,Is the first one good?
eatmymustard,"OP says ""screenshots"" and only posts one of them. Bro was in a rush for that sweet reddit karma lol"
who-ee-ta,The best part is that the default audio/text will be in Ukrainian.And there will not be ru audio/text at all.Absolutely the best reason to preorder
MDF87,"Completely forgot about this game to be honest, seem to be spending all my time worrying about when Starfield is coming out!"
meltingpotato,that I only see on screenshot?
Defiant_Sprinkles686,"The oringinal was one of my fav games growing up, but never got it to run right on my the school laptop I had, I need to grab it off GoG or somesuch."
Practical_County_501,Oooft time for a new rig. Looks gorgeous....
BonDragon,"Teasing...but will it be pleasing.  I want to horde so much found items that I'm crawling to a safe zone while radiated wild dogs are chasing me, all to get an upgraded hazmat suit."
Jackalodeath,">What's your thoughts?  

It looks like a picture of a rendered game?"
Rajvagli,Screenshot? Or did I miss something?
zeroxcero,amogus
CloudRadiant2356,Yeaaaaa
THE_GR8_MIKE,Tis indeed an FPS.
Flat-Feedback-3525,Screenshot
RainingBlood78,looks great i really love kind of these games and i hope when the game release it will be playable because i dont wanna see new cyberpunk or callisto protocol
Bob_Juan_Santos,"man, we could've had this game so much earlier if those russian bitches didn't invade."
Schkywalker,"Keep in mind that this is not an in-engine gameplay screenshot.

This is concept art made to look as realistic as possible."
That1Guy80903,Shut up and take my money already!
DirtyGingy,Now they just need to post the version for console and most middle of the line GPUs with the foliage details waaaaay down
k4Anarky,"Get out of mah swamp, stalker!"
GreinBR,I see this post as I'm playing Stalker Gamma
GamerViking,That sorta looks like bloodsucker village ü§î
B4SSF4C3,SO excited for this
h3rpad3rp,Cheeki breeki
Big_Deetz,"I just hope I can keep track of the npcs to make sure the important ones don't die and hope there's objective markers.

My two only big faults of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (I'm sure others have tons, the bugs to me were avoidable or could be reset. The character deaths tho, really influenced the game)"
MikeTheDude23,Wish this game had coop.
qBoris,What is the engine they develop
vegancrossfiter,It will be shit
KikuSui,I can't wait. I take it there still isn't a release date due to small dick putin? Might come out along with star citizen finishing....
BumpkinBoi401,When does this game come out again? Or at least predicted too be released
Twiztid_Angel_,"I wish it would‚Äôve came out before I go to BMT, but it won‚Äôt"
Taikunman,Please be good... I love the STALKER series so much and I just want something modernized with QoL improvements and an engine that isn't held together with hopes and dreams. Anomaly was a step in the right direction but a bit too hardcore for me.
TheDarkClaw,Those stalkers need to get out of their
TheKrytosVirus,My thought is that I wish it was going to be on PS5. My PC is way too old to upgrade. I would need new everything and I cannot afford that.
ExplosiveRunes,"This looks fake, and not in a good way. I really doubt this is an actual in game screenshot, it feels like a composite render. The orange ecologist in particular looks really odd compared to the closer guy and the hands. It feels like at least the main scene with the orange guy was rendered separately from the hands and close guy."
pattyrobes,FUCK I want to get excited but after cyberpunk I‚Äôll never let screenshots or ‚Äútrailers‚Äù give me expectations again‚Ä¶
Long-Dead-Stars,"Ohhhh

Oh my gods

Prettyyyyyy"
Gekkomoria,Ketr?
FifthElement1,You think I can jump right into 2 without playing the older ones?
soulofdragon1,"is that rookie village? i dont know much of the game, i havent left rookie village its to scary"
underated_imbecile,"Looks sus

(Im sorry)"
butters1337,Getting some Fallout: NV vibes with the hud.
Evilmaze,Looks incredible
midmar,"Hmmmn looking condensed, not a good sign. Could end up with a strong theme park feel. Hopefully thats just the art direction of the media team not the development one. Condensed games also tend to be less sandbox and more focused, think metro exodus. This would be a huge blow, hopefully not the case. Need to feel big or something will have been lost."
anormalgeek,"Nice. Even if they just kept making sequels over and over using the same graphics and engine from CoP, I'd still be happy. I always loved these games."
Un111KnoWn,what fun if he holding?
theDefa1t,Looks dope
According-Stage-1098,How well will this run on a steamdeck
ExpertResearcher8640,"Hey guys i need help

when i was younger i used to play one sci fi game it was fps something like star wars but without light sabers and other things star wars have it had different maps and game modes i remember playing capture flag with bots because i didnt have internet at the time on some maps there was like motocycles without wheeles it just fly around and some maps have like off road cars  
  
sorry for my bad english and i hope someone know what im talking about so i dont look like idiot XD"
Rindan,I think I came a little.
Curse3242,"This game will bang or just flop hard

Usually screenshots/gameplay like this doesn't translate to actual gameplay. Or if it does it's not fun.

But I've also played The Forrest which ended up being one of my favourites. So this can happen with Stalker"
beyondhypothermia,my 3060 better handle this game üò©
Dubapoop,"I never played a stalker game but I really like the metro games and enjoy open world games in general. This game is looking
Really good and can't wait to dive in"
AusNormanYT,6 bladed windmill* how unrealistic /s
_GzX,"Looks good, really good. If I‚Äôm honest, I‚Äôm a bit skeptical because of how too good it looks though considering it‚Äôs on UE5? I just hope it runs as good as it looks. Excited nonetheless!"
idontcarewhatever222,""" What is your thoughts?""
Grammar dude, that was my first thought."
vara28,I love graphics
hey_there_kitty_cat,"Props to these devs for taking a 15 year break and actually making a sequel and not just updating graphics and calling is ""STALKER REMASTERED FULL EDITION""."
extrafarts44,Looking great!
Zcypot,I remember playing call of pry something. Downloaded a mod that reworked it I believe and all. Played like 40mins and bitched out when it got dark haha. I should give it another try. I liked how the game felt
Savings_Ad_5286,"looks sick, too bad I wont be able run it lol"
CaptainBlob,Hopefully it isn‚Äôt gonna be a vertical slice of a game‚Ä¶ and instead fully delivers‚Ä¶
Johnnyboc,God damn the details on the weapon viewmodel and foliage are good. I just hope it runs well.
Prince_Sabu,Will this be on gamepass?
_evan-t,This is a game
InsaneMcFries,"CodWAW vibes anyone??

Also the OG STALKER good?"
cerberus00,That compass makes me go hmmmmm. Not sure if I'm a fan. Not a lot going on in the UI really which is ok but not much to speculate on.
xdr01,"My favourite post apocalyptic series. Can't wait for this,  it's been so long

Good hunting Stalker"
idiotic__gamer,"I want to play it so bad.  I am playing Shadow of Chernobyl now.  My computer is running on an Intel I3, though, so I guess it will never happen..."
Mr_master89,If I could afford a PC this would be one of the first games I'd get on it
Ah_Kira,"Not actually a screenshot, just a video recording of the frozen gsme if the track record of the previous games is something to rely on lol
Still great games tho"
stuckinleaves,Super Fucking Excited!!
Atlas7674,Since flamethrowers are probs gonna be prevalent I hope they make fire look good
kalizar,Can't wait for my 1070 to try this shit.
DrGroda,I can hear my old 1070 crying
xXRadicalRexXx,If it's stalker anomaly with these graphics it's the best game ever
helmsracheal,When is it coming out?
kalitarios,Im in
bthartist,Is this on steam?
UnitedPaint1280,I can already feel my PC burning haha! üò≠
wellbornwinter6,Which platform is this?
DoggieDMB,I was promised screenshots.. plural
ezypee,I fucking loved #1 despite all it's flaws. I'm going to build a new PC so I can play this game. Hopefully it doesn't take a year to get it running properly like last time.
m3ronpan,I really eye each Stalker game but I hate they put that monster bullshit in it and never play the games.
willy--wanka,My video card was screaming just loading up the image.
mctoasterson,Cheeki Breeki
Ondexb,I‚Äôm worries for this game with all the DLC and skins that this game has.
Sands1,"I feel like i missed out on playing the original, hopefully the new one reaches completion ‚ù§"
Ok-Ambition-9432,"Other than the lighting and forage, it looks like rust."
Lathiel85,"...(cries in Playstation)  


I loved the first game."
MR_PLAGUE_DR,"Game looks good, I just hope it runs good. The gameplay looked pretty leggy. More hopium."
ElRetardio,"Looks good but S.T.A.L.K.E.R was never about the graphics. 

Pretty worried they‚Äôve made too farcry-y with the compas etc too and with how long it‚Äôs been, is anyone really left from the people that had the original vision?"
Foxon_the_fur,"I dont even care if it looks this good. I want it to run, and be relatvely bug-free. Stalker even now with mediocre graphics still holds up because it's a great game."
SirenC-137,aren‚Äôt there always screenshots and videos of games before release always better than the actual  game? i feel like that happens a lot
drink-till-im-dead,Looks nice
Cleverbird,"This feels like one of those infamous Ubisoft bullshots to me.

Or at the very least, I doubt a lot of people will be able to play it at these settings."
imkuboiiii,Dean boiii
Seanspeed,"This looks like an extremely high resolution shot(downsampled).  There's just so much fine and dense detail here that no AA method could resolve properly like this without being combined with a very high resolution.  

And it's also why high resolution is so critical and not a waste at all.  As games get more detailed, we need resolution to keep up to handle it, especially in motion.  Reconstruction techniques are a god send to enable this without hugely increasing GPU and memory demands."
Vesnianka,"I remember the first launch of the game back in 2007. And many years later, I‚Äôve been playing Stalker with new mods. It‚Äôs so nice to have such a game in your collection. 
I hope in 2023 we‚Äôll finally get to enjoy a new chapter in the Stalker world!"
Alarming_Sea_6894,Looks like concept art.
DrunkToni,I bet this is how a saw first game back in the days
Xem1337,Stalker Dev died in the Ukraine not too long ago.  Atrocious waste of life.
Simay_13,I wonder if Russian language will be included...
GorboMcDuggins,I am so fucking hype for this game. I can't wait to fuck around in an Unreal 5 version of the zone.
Andxel,"This is going to be my introduction to the series and I already know I'm probably going to love it.

Loved the first two Metro games already (wasn't a fan of Exodus).

Do we have a date?"
Emotional_Fox_3498,perfectüóø
nudeldifudel,What even is the stalker games. I've never heard about them.
mundozeo,Is this the game that tried to implement NFTs?
whiteleshy,"My expectations are too high. Coming from modded Anomaly I think I'll end up being disappointed no matter what. 

I just hope the sandbox possibilities bring us as many mods as the latter."
2latemc,Btw you can download the demo on their Discord.
griff306,I spent too much time looking for the 2 screenshots
RenanBan,I really hope series s dont run like garbage
Kamenridethewind007,wow i was sure with the war in ukraine this game was dead in the water. but wow im excited again i hope they can win and get back to this game full time. rip to the devs who lost their lives to putins war machine. slava ukrani!
shadowdash66,If anyone knows how to pre-order the U.S Collectors edition lmk please. I've been supporting the devs as much as i could. They're doing the best they can under the war conditions.
shadowdash66,"If any of you like the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series as much as i do, i highly recommend the movie Stalker (1979) and the book Roadside Picnic by  Arkady Strugatsky. The Metro 2033 series also were books before being adapted into games."
DrT0rp3d0,My PC is too bad to run a game like this
TravisMay6,Oh yes please.
humboldtliving,This looks like Hunt
jtown82,Think my ol 1080 will get me 30fps and still look decent?
Anusbagels,I think theres only one screenshot s.
core_krogoth,Cheeki breeki iv damke!
S8891,Summer 2023 look sick
