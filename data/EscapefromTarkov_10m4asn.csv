lilwhiteboye420,This makes me wanna hop back on this wipe hows 7.62 ak recoil?
mamontain,"remove this post, I want my cheap flea scar-l back"
circa86,Awesome it's like firing an actual gun now.
3-Tron,did they patch visual recoil or something?
Fantastic_Ratio2174,Basically it means that the game became more realistic. It's still as hard since everyone can benefit from better recoil. Less rng
chilifngrdfunk,I can't fucking wait to play when I get home at 3 a.m. lol I'ma fuck some scavs up
Kmieciu4ever,"IMHO the SCAR-L should not have 5 points of dispersion when most other 5.56 and 5.45 rifles have 15. 

Also: 30 points of dispersion on the AUG. 

Is the BSG racist towards Austrian rifles?"
JeeWizz17,This is beautiful... <3
matthewoconno,"Hot take: the standard recoil for 556, 5.45, 300 should be close to this"
vindico1,"Nerfed a bit this morning, as well as the mutant."
welter_skelter,Holy cow! A gun firing the way it does in real life!
Sesleri,[SCAR was just nerfed this morning](https://i.imgur.com/QbPOqis.png)
tehmightyengineer,Nice
No-Phase2131,Ridiculous
SnakeSkinBots,Tighter than your Mom
ur4s26,This sub is so fucked. For the last year all people have done is cry about the terrible recoil and camera recoil. Now BSG have buffed it people are crying that now itâ€™s too easy and chads are just going to run around deleting everyone (like this wasnâ€™t the case anyway).
sulowitch,very nice! finally can people play all guns and not only few of them.
elgordon1,"Would you look at that, lore accurate scar recoil"
NotARealDeveloper,Can you do a video shooting at the same target while circle strafing?
Rezhyn,"If you don't care for 60 rounders the AK-101 is better in pretty much every way. Less recoil, double the ergo, and way higher muzzle velocity."
katanahibana,its so sick that they did this. been having actual fun pvp all day
BucDan,"Ah, 10 MOA at 100 yards, full auto ðŸ˜‚. Meta is back."
Preposturous,"Great, now I will die quicker to the giga chadz"
Lonely_Scylla,"bro the scar-l has been shit for as long as it was in game, can you not encourage BSG to nerf it the day it gets good ? :("
Cosmandoo,"Watch this be a bug affecting every gun and in 1-2 weeks (cuz bsg is slow in recognising new bugs) they revert it to the original previous system. Haha. 

Genuinely tho, I would not be surprised if this new change was in some way or case a bug and unintentional. 

With that being said, this is the first change since this wipe where I can actually understand the reasoning. The rest, like removing m80 2 weeks after wipe, flea changes etc all don't make sense to me."
ApprehensiveSir6280,"No, it is not allowed to post. You shouldn't be posting p*rn in this subreddit /jk."
TuroSaave,"This doesn't even feel like Tarkov anymore. Looking forward to when it does.

Edit: I just mean I am very positively surprised."
Ok-Age1230,"Less recoil then a pistol lmao
PhYsIkS"
MadDog_8762,"Yeah, thatâ€™s the kinda shit im worried about

The only thing that should get THAT precise full auto are belt fed machine guns on bipods

Otherwise, whats the point of em?"
Turbulent_Meaning637,can you post the gun build?
sakic1519,I wonder what is the mdr 7.62 and scar 7.62 recoil like
Dayyyman,Is the HK meta again?
xxxZEDxxx,Hell yea let's goooo
OddBoifromspace,SCAR-L*
0utF0x-inT0x,What ammo are you using for 556 in this?
Daniluk41,tbh i think its good
boomstik4,"Finally, my favourite gun in thr game isn't absolutely terrible"
Wingklip,Ah yes a weapon to delete the aimbotters
H0lzm1ch3l,"Yeah, nice. Now we just need to slightly nerf attachments."
Gaziel1,What's your level in recoil control? Tried the G36 and it still has a lot of recoil for a 5.56 gun compared to the SCAR.
lonigus,"They called me mad, they called me delusional, but look who is laughing now. Me! With like 20 scars in my stash i farmed from rogues. Ha!"
CoughItUp22,I built an M4 last night with 38/80 recoil. It's a god damned laser beam.
KaiDynasty,"Honestly i see this as a good recoil change overall, i am curious on the difference between start wipe attachments vs end wipe attachments, i don't like laser beams but i also don't want spaghetti arms"
M-Gnarles,AR meta back
Waxitron,ITS ABOUT GODDAMN TIME.
GardenofSalvation,"God's in his heaven, all right with the world"
awzaq,"Scar-L always had the best recoil after the 6th or so shot out of all the assault rifles, I don't know why people always slept on it"
mrfl3tch3r,Clearly OP! Needs nerfing! /s
Kyrrt-,Man I thought I'd be allowed to run scars for longer ðŸ˜­
Blue_Eyed_Brick,Bruh just delete than negative recoil already
jager_mcjagerface,This really makes me wanna hop back in
AllYouNeedIsLove69,I was one of those people complaining about laserbeam weapons... boy i was wrong. Iam so stoked for this.
morklonn,Does the scar still glow in the dark?
openclosebracket,Holy shit this game is going to be insanely interesting in the coming months
Plank_Pusher,Time for me to swap from the vpo back to the akm. Happy days
crpiecho,2019 ptsd setting in
StanPole,anybody tried vss and as val? they are pretty dogshit even after changes
rinkydinkis,"I consider this usable, not a laser.  This seems great imo.  I wish the initial recoil was not ridiculous so you could should semi auto if wanted (as well as reducing the need to prefire, a dumb thing), but this is a positive change."
ImaginaryAI,I beamed someone in the head with an AKS74u on customs from about 30 meters full auto. Was pretty happy about that. Nice to have Akâ€™s early wipe that are good
_Bike_seat_sniffer,"looks reasonable, this is how weapons handle"
D_Glatt69,So we hodling Meta 556 guns? because prices are about to skyrocket ðŸ˜‚
Bl1ndVe,"This is all good for now, but they need to rework the recoil system, make it predictable not random, let ppl use their skills to control recoil. Remove the stupid initial recoil and make each gun have a recoil pattern based on how they act in Real life"
Kaieron,"Oh guys... Is this reddit for the next days.

Posting about weapons with zero recoil..."
DiViNiTY1337,"Ssshhhhhh the SCAR-L has always been the best budget 5.56 weapon since it came out, remove this!!!!"
LucasNoober,Are you compensating? If not this is nuts
yourAverageAnomaly,"I canâ€™t wait to play next wipe with all these fixes! (Next wipe because Iâ€™ll be destroyed by chads because I havenâ€™t played in a while, so I prefer next wipe so everyone is at my level and I can get better gear and weapons along with them)"
Silviu83u,This is how it should have been from day 1
Seanannigans14,"Idk, recoil was definitely a lot to handle last wipe into this wipe but these lasers are going to turn it back to the days of people just holding W and mouse 1. 

Like everyone was still getting kills no problem with it. But now everyone will have lasers. So that's.... Fun?"
Chadgiggs,Wow this literally 500x better than before
embiate,u/savevideo
Ghostman223,So was this done without a client update or what?
Doobie717,"nope you can't, only allowed to bitch and moan about everything under the sun here."
skychasezone,Bro all my favorite guns are expensive now wtf
Appropriate_Baker919,rd with us ammo meta rn
MrSMIIITH,"Thats why the scar is 100k+ on the flea last night, I was gonna sell mine because ive never been a fan. Cheapest one I saw was 112k and figured it was for a gunsmith task."
Sneaky_Rhin0,can you post your build from this video?
hoochymamma,"This is dumb as fuck.

Enjoy your recoil cod lovers - hope this shit gets reverted asap.

And if not, implement cs 1.6 recoil with specific spray patterns that will make spraying not worth it."
SOVERElGN_SC,"Thatâ€™s too much tbh. Scar-L should have somewhat similar recoil as another non bulpup 5.56 rifles like M4. BSG has yet to remove initial recoil jump and make precise tweaks to stock recoil value for specific weapons like this, aksu74, and some else which are unreasonably too accurate or opposite.
Otherwise super accurate full auto guns meta may return. Realistic barrel drift around aim point is a key to avoid laser guns."
Kuyi,Itâ€™s only the camera and itâ€™s best in slot manâ€¦.
umpekakana,O P
Sieve-Boy,Recoil? Never heard of her.
