ctaskatas,"I‚Äôve been saying for a while that the only way to make high tier gear and ammo feel high tier is to make them rare and hard to get. If everyone has high tier gear and ammo, no one does."
TheRealJomogo,I just wish quest keys are better to get.
Sativian,"It seems BSG is following through with what they said before wipe, they‚Äôre gonna up in raid drop rates for good gear and lower the availability of it on traders and flea market. Hopefully there‚Äôs enough loot to run what we‚Äôd like"
JT_23,Another few weeks of people hip firing praying on that rng headshot üòç
SnooApples2090,This is fine only if raids become a good source of good gear. High end rooms and keycard rooms should be insane. Why is it when I open a corporation‚Äôs locked security arsenal  I get a bunch of random civilian attachments and parts like toz stocks and hunter mags
elracing21,My only issue is them doing this after 1-2 weeks of wipe. Why wasn't it done for the wipe. There are try hards already level 50+ where this won't affect them.
JustBakedPotato,I like it. Early and mid wipe are the most fun parts of the game for a reason. Ppl complaining want to rush to the cool high tier loot and play for a couple weeks before they get bored and stop playing until next wipe. I‚Äôd rather the game stay balanced and fun longer
LordtoRevenge,‚ÄúAll‚Äù
le_upboats_ebin,"As a pretty sweaty player, I agree with you. Especially excited about the removal of the meta scopes. I would like it if those were removed from the flea completely. Once the game is in that everyone has a fancy scope and can reliably engage you at almost any distance and 2 tap you through your level 4 or 5 armor, it's over, very stale but I keep playing anyway because I love the game. The best shootouts are the ones that feel scrappy and enduring. This is a great change for the game."
Kplatz,Honestly it's more like getting rid of mid-wipe entirely. It's going from early wipe straight into end-game because by the time you can even get the mid-game stuff you can just get the end-game stuff instead.
DJDemyan,Shit man everyone's mad about not being able to buy 300 PS12B anymore... Anyone thought to actually go look in ammo crates??
Robbeeeen,"If you remove all armor above lvl 3 and all ammo above 30 pen, all you did was make previous mid-tier gear the new high-tier gear and delete half the equipment from the game.

There needs to be a balance between availability and reward for progression"
Royal_Ad_9750,"It won‚Äôt be balanced. The Timmy‚Äôs will quit because they will never get access to anything and the sweats and the streamers will still have an almost unlimited supply. Good look killing these guys with trash ammo. Mid wipe is going to be dead. I really do hope I am wrong about this but this gatekeeping stuff on a 6 month cycle kinda sucks for non sweat lords. I guess we shall see. M62 got bumped to 52 dollars a round this morning so not only are you going to have to unlock it but also be filthy rich to buy it. I dunno, I‚Äôm concerned but only time will tell."
Leucauge,"Narrator:  ""All did not, in fact, ask for a longer mid wipe. In fact, most players take much of a wipe to hit max traders if they hit max traders at all."""
NIALL_FTW,im all for the new changes but why tf has it took them this long to implement them into the game.. and why tf do it a week into the wipe and not before the wipe? we all know cheaters and sweats will be able to access these the same while most of the player base are locked out of it
Borschik,"I hate early or mid wipe. I just rush to max traders fast with the most default gear, and only after I start to play normally. It's like finishing a tutorial. After 42 you can build guns, wear decent armor and decent bullets instead of wasting money on crap. And also less time is wasted on keeping track of what items you need for quests and hideout"
AcidWulf,"Yes a mid wipe progression slog by also dealing with constant rubberbanding, memory leaks, 1st month cheaters galore which stifle progress as is, FIR only to lose it busted AI scavs and many other common issues that have plagued this game for years with 'silent update changes'.  Lets be real about this and understand that while these things make for a more ""intense and realistic"" experience its caused more headache due to the change in how everyone has to play in order to cope with the new standards. Not only do you have to dedicate that much more time to even reap the rewards of your play you're also widening the gap between those who can actually devote more than 2-3 hours a day playing this game constantly. Yeah there wont be a solution that satisfies everyone but for sure this isn't helping those who want to try and experience the game while being reamed out by the community and in game player base for not putting in the ""time and effort"" to learn and ""git gud""."
1BalledBandit,Just wish these changes were implemented BEFORE the wipe and thought out a little more.
HearMeOutGuy,"Completely agree love the changes so far, was a little pissed off about PS ammo being moved from L1 -> L2 but I had like 500 rounds that I didn‚Äôt even get to use before I was L2 trader‚Ä¶ made me realize I was using SKS as a crutch and it actually made me worse lol, been having a way better wipe due to these mid game changes, and feel like I can actually grind this wipe out for much longer this time around."
leroyjenkinsdayz,I honestly think the changes are great. Would have liked to see them from the beginning of the wipe but oh well. Only a small fraction of players speedrun the game‚Ä¶I‚Äôd be willing to bet the vast majority are still under lvl 25 meaning there aren‚Äôt many people with ammo boxes full of M61 and 7.62 BP yet
GaroldFjord,"I mostly wish they would've made the changes with the wipe, instead of staggered, and after the wipe's started. Granted, it's a tiny minority, but there were sweatlords that were already in the later-mid stages, when changes to extend the part they'd already passed come through. 

Like, bruh.. if you wanna extend the mid-game phase, make stuff more scarce, sure, whatever. But do so at the beginning, not after we've all watched all the streamers sweat past those changes, because of drops."
rush-banana,3 weeks in is mid game? I miss the days when you could play this game part-time
Cultural_Sink2656,"The problem with your argument is that we‚Äôre only a few weeks into the wipe, and countless people are already to what you call ‚Äúmid wipe‚Äù the average player who isnt maidenless and on the game 24/7 wont hit ‚Äúmid wipe‚Äù for a few more weeks and will STILL NOT have traders maxed. Remove everything above tier 4, make it either FIR only or craftable at a high cost. ‚ÄúRare‚Äù and ‚Äúhighly valuable‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be as easy to obtain as 200k roubles‚Ä¶"
GameTechniqueTV,Same. Love it. There was barely any progression. Finish with questing guns and you are max traders. Now there‚Äôs way more viable options
Desperate-Leave902,why not just ad lv 5 traders?
Swontree,"I brought in a RFB and FMJ ammo yesterday... I almost died to scavs because I was hitting their lvl 4 armor... In the middle of looting and I heard a bush noise, I left and went to extract. Fuck whoever that was lol."
I-wanna-fuck-SCP1471,The problem with these changes is they're not thought out properly and are clearly thrown in quickly.
Velihopea,"What is kinda bullshit how they move/remove 50% of the content to lvl4 traders and some obscure barters. Getting level 2/3 traders used to be a point in the game where you could quite freely start MODDING guns and trying out new things and gear. Currently however, level 2-3 traders are mostly fcking useless. Being level 24 atm, I have very few viable options to go for: shotguns, mosin, AKs or some face tap smgs. I think it fcking sucks how different viable playstyles, ammo and weapons are now virtually unusable unless if you pump 150hours into the wipe."
little_poisoner,yeah man I love that the ASH-12 is now completely unusable (part of the ever increasing list of unusable calibres) and the only way to play the game is going to be using 7.62x39 PS ammo for 6 months
TurtleTerrorizer,"I‚Äôm glad, there were too many items in the game, I was getting confused, I‚Äôm glad they took everything out so I don‚Äôt have to worry about it anymore"
hiddencamela,"In its present form. I would like audio reprioritized and optimized on every map.  
I cannot 1v1 a chad if my AK only has BT.  Not gonna win too well against a Korund + Altyn if they're at all competent..."
admin123454321,"i think the only big issue is this is a massive, during-wipe change. now all the nerds who plowed through early games in a couple weeks have stockpiles and everyone that‚Äôs slower is fucked. also they should at the least set a new quest reward for quest unlocks instead of removing the reward entirely"
Mad_Flavours,"I think they can extend wipe by adding the chug jug healing items from fortnight, and do away with all statuses

Maybe some skins and emotes too ü§î"
,[deleted]
Yungterpintine,"Good change, people just hate change and this community tends to bitch about anything possible."
,[deleted]
rodrikJahn,"Good changes, Redditors are just bunch of complaining hoes"
Wardy1259,All these changes but they can‚Äôt fix the damn audio
Ok-Street-7240,This is not a longer mid wipe. This is a no end game grind
Burn_Loot-Murder,"You will still get shit on. Im almost elite endurance and strength. I still have access to meta mp153 and flechette. I am wearing korunds now that you cannot penetrate. All they did was remove your ability to kill me. While you rat 1 raid, I extract with a full backpack 3 times. This does nothing but hurt you."
Thesaladman98,"No what we got is removal of late wipe. Like half of the shit literally is removed from the game (rys is now impossible to get through any means expect scav case maybe).

40 hours to run an ash 12

Only craft/fir literally every high tier ammo which crafting is fine if it took like an hour, but I'm not gonna say ""oh I want to run an hk, time to wait 20 hours for my bullets!"" That's just fucked. 

Certain armors are fir only to the point where you might see them once per wipe. 

This wasn't an extension of mid wipe it was an attempt which failed horribly. Class 4 and ammo that pens class 4 is now the late wipe because the rest of it pretty much doesn't exist. I mean you can't call a progression point that's not reachable because the items in it don't exist a progression point."
Midgetben1234,I don‚Äôt really give a crap about the changes just means my trusty mosin is gonna get even more use same for the benelli I‚Äôll take it
daniteira,Loving it! Let's get into these nice gunfights once again
,"Everything you say makes sense, except when you take the slick and one stack of m62 you found after 40 scav raids and instantly get bent over by a cheater."
Daamus,just realized the moved the tac-30 scope barter too....
MoonBoy2DaMoon,"I completely agree, it‚Äôs weird to me that there‚Äôs so many posts crying that High Tier ammo and armors are more exclusive now. Chads shouldn‚Äôt be having gang wars 12 days into a 6 month wipe"
Special_Function,It has literally been two weeks since the wipe.
Joethebob7,"Yeah I've been super busy since like a couple days into wipe so I haven't been able to play at all, and I still feel like I'm going to be able to compete"
SilentReavus,"The problem is that there isn't really that much ""mid tier"" ammo.

There's the crappy stuff and the good stuff and there's like maybe one in between round for each caliber"
DiCePWNeD,Just make a ll5 5 already or something
colesbrandcocaine,its awesome and i dont know why people want to get to end game and just run mutants on customs for 6 months again.
jeff5551,"I really do like the mixup, especially the BP change, but for some of the changes with armor and especially the m80 to peacekeeper 4 (surely 3 would suffice) I wish there was a way we could give feedback and actually be listened to other than pushing for a big streamer to bring it up"
Red-Spy_In-The_Base,"My problem is the timing. Do this when the wipe starts, else turbo sweats and streamers won‚Äôt be impacted by this. Aren‚Äôt they the ones BSG is trying to slow down?"
theTinTank,I love the changes too! Now just remove flea BSG
,"I initially hated this meta shift, mostly due to reaching PK3 and wanting to utilize M80 just prior to the hotfix. But after some consideration I have to agree with OP now."
Vastroy,"I‚Äôm gonna miss ash-12 tho, they also put the next highest tier of that caliber to lvl 4 and it only has like 28 pen"
ConsiderationSalt590,Why did they not do these changes before the wipe. Just making uncommunicated changes all the time makes them look like idiots that dont know what they are doing.
IllState5161,"I think my only issue with the changes being made is that they're doing them a bit too late. Some of the more cracked, no-job having no-lifers already have all they need for the wipe ammo wise. I wish I was exaggerating, but one of my no-lifer friends who's already level 46 already has an entire ammo case of RSh-12 ammo and half a case of M62's."
-Shibdib-,"I like the changes, I don't like that they weren't done 2 weeks ago at the start of the wipe.

Sweaty players and streamers still have all this gear hoarded because they waited 2 weeks to make the changes. Means there's a massive gear gap between them and normal players now that will be less easily overcome."
Fissure_211,"Unpopular opinion,  but here it goes: 


BSG will never truly extend the ""early wipe"" because this game will always have mega chads who no life the game and hit max traders week one. Those same players will then come to reddit and support any anti-QOL change BSG makes and claim that they ""want to extend the early wipe."" 

The fuck they do. No matter what changes BSG makes, they will put 80+ hours in week one of the wipe and be completely maxed out. They don't want a longer early wipe; they want to rush to the end as fast as possible. They want to get out of early wipe as quickly as they can so that they can use all of the ""good"" stuff. That's why they rush the game every wipe. They have no interest using a stock AKM for weeks on end. The extended early wipe argument is a complete farce. 

I'm not saying that changes shouldn't be made, but the ""extend early wipe"" argument really is just a line of crap. I'd also like to see changes made at the startbof the wipe rather than randomly throughout it. That way all players operate under the same system/set of rules, and BSG can get a true prolonged data sample for testing (assuming that's the supposed intent behind changes and such, which, ha)."
MarcusAurelius0,Why not literally make it so high tier loot doesnt spawn until after a certain time has passed?
Epinephrine186,"I'm fine with them doing all this, but this feels rushed and not well thought out, seeing as they're doing it post wipe and they didn't do it with the wipe. They could've planned this out months in advance and took their time, included big sweeping changes in the patch notes, then adjusted slightly on the fly. The timing of it all is just weird."
gucogeko,"I‚Äôm loving this wipe honestly. Me and the boys hop on every night for an hour or two after the kids are asleep. Weekends we go hrs for PVP while everyone else is on, but it‚Äôs nice not running into chads with BIS everything."
TeeRoww,"Its the fact that they're removing all of these mid tier ammos from the game now. They took out 9x21 PS, AP 6.3 is now $12 a round and we're stuck using 855, 7.62 PS, or 5.45 BP/PP. Getting rid of the top tier ammos or making them max level traders is fine. But dont get rid of the inbetween ammo as well."
224nugget,I am absolutely loving all these changes. I may be alone or the few that feel this way but I‚Äôm honestly having the most fun of any wipe yet.
diquehead,"It won't really change much IMO.  Class 4 is just gonna get melted by BT/BP and PS.  The TTK will still be as fast (it's all head,eyes anyway am i right).  FWIW most people even at the end of wipe, especially last wipe, are running troopers, korunds or gzhels.  Stuff like slicks and hexgrids are definitely the exception and not the rule.  Now good luck if you encounter someone running tier 6.

I don't necessarily disagree with the intent of the changes but the implementation kind of a head scratcher... like m80 and m62 being available at PK4 now.  That effectively kills M80 because who's gonna bother to run it now?  If you're good enough to get level 4 traders it's not like money is an object so buying M62 over M80 isn't really a big deal.  Scav karma has made farming roubles hilariously easy as well

What really annoys me most though is that they should have done this before the game wiped and not a couple weeks in.  People will adapt despite all the outrage but I think the way the went about it was really poorly executed.

As someone who enjoys RPGs and MMO type games progression is a major part of my enjoyment.  I would be lying if I said it didn't sting a bit losing access to some of the higher end equipment, especially since the gun porn in EFT is the best there is.

It would be nice if they would add some of these ammos into the loot pool as ammo boxes.  It's boring finding nothing but 5.45 and the occasional 7.62.  Being able to find a box of 30 M62 or .300 AP (lol) here and there would be a welcome addition IMO

Maybe they could have just done a big ammo rebalance instead?  Like adjusting dmg/pen values.  Maybe bumping up some of the shittier ammo that no one ever runs and maybe nerfing some of the meta stuff a bit"
TLT4,Thank you BSG!
Kelcius,Some of you were mid wipe on the second day‚Ä¶
marniconuke,Does anyone think that it's an issue that early and mid wipo last a week each? the fact that people can reach lvl 40 and end game gear in two weeks seems more of a game issue.
Soulcaller,"no life streamers they gonna find the next best thing anyways, people gonna follow that, and another, and another... down line couple of years and everyone runs around with a hatchet n gobbling  loot, bc they developing the game to the top5%.

Top players always gonna midmax, find best solutions, causals keep alive any game mater of fact.. cum guzzlers keep parsing the changes instead of proper balancing, now they can run around mosinLPS with a diper till lvl42. What time to be alive."
abramthrust,"Neat, can we get sound that isn't a lottery?

Been asking for that at least as long!"
lliwyerf,This is my favorite change of the whole wipe imo. Now finding a lvl 6 in a stash is a game changer instead of ‚Äúoh cool now i can actually play on par with the rest of the mid wipe player Base‚Äù
Wormholer_No9416,But muh gzhl
Coteezy,I totally agree I just wish they didn't make the changes during the wipe. It only hinders the newer players while giving more experinced/better players the chance to have stocked up on some of these items giving us another edge which we don't really need.
micro_ufos,This is just more grind I'm not gong to participate it and thus never see this ammo and armor. Fuck this half a year wipe shit and mid wipe I'll be back when it wipes and everyone starts off with dogshit again that's when the game is the most fun.
Infinite_Tac0,"Yea I do like how more high end stuff is getting harder to get, I think the only people complaining will be the ones trying to get lvl 40-50+ in one month or less. (Which I'm sure the will be the loudest ones on this thread). But for my brothers out there with a job, I'm with you."
roflwafflelawl,"I love it imo. Personally I want BSG to move all useless or not-worth-using ammo to be used by Scavs and have a barter for 3:1 bad to good ammo. And by good ammo I'm not saying high tier ammo, those should be FIR, but decent ammo."
Sensitive_Regular388,I crafted 3k BP last wipe never did grenadier. Doesn't really change much IMO
errorsniper,"Tarkov is at its best when most fights are close to medium range and long and drawn out fights. When its lazer m4's and armor is functionally not there and you never see who is killing you it is at its worst.

Take out tasks and give me a monthly wipe que."
MysteriousWeird7126,"You aren't alone. There is a VERY specific image that Tarkov was intended to be. Many think they know what it is. I personally believe the final product aligns with what I hope, and so far, they have managed to move that direction almost constantly, if slowly. I think it may end up being a goofy mess when its done, but it will be a magnificent goofy mess until they shut it down :P"
pallypal,"My problem is they could've just extended the 'mid wipe' feeling theoretically infinitely by actually balancing the armor and weapons. If there wasn't such a massive gap between armor, weapons and ammo there wouldn't be any need to make things harder to get. This is an annoyance to the hardcore and potentially crippling to the late wipe experience for anyone who isn't already 40+.

This is a stopgap at best and will create degenerate gameplay at worst."
Atreaia,"People have Kappa, mid wipe hello?"
Blackfire701,"The only thing I wish were slightly different were that high tier guns were viable to be used. I try and avoid buying guns from traders, and even on the flea market, and prefer to use guns that take from people's bodies or guns that I find in stashes, weapon boxes, etc. But probably the thing I really don't like about this is that even if I do find a cool gun like an Ash 12 or a vector, it doesn't really matter, because I can't even buy ammo to support it. I wish the game was a little bit more on the gun rarity side rather than the ammo rarity. It's annoying to have to nerve a whole caliber just because you have one or two good guns. Ammo and magazines shouldn't be the bottleneck (looking at you MP7) and if they just made it harder to get things like a DVL or an MP7 or a vector you wouldn't have to nerf the entire ammo type and availability, it'd just be more interesting when you find and actually cool gun in raid."
rbstewart7263,"Same, next wipe when I give tarkov another go I don't have to worry as much about try hards bumfucking their wayto the top. It really can start to be more about my skill vs theirs rather than their gear vs mine."
Atalvez,Agreed and i would push further. I would make the t4 armors either more expensive or barter only as well.
roywarner,FIR only and don't make them guaranteed spawns on raiders and such so they can't be farmed by no lifers.
muatdks,M80 change L
JIssertell,‚ÄúMid wipe‚Äù been like 3 weeks
Sir_Celcius,Okay but M80 being peace 4 which is literally standard ball 7.62x51 ammo while LPS is at prapor 1 is kinda messed up. Same with 56a1 availability vs PP ammo which is equivalent.  They don't want people using western style guns
Kyle700,"Everyone cares too much about ammo. It doesn't really matter in this game. If you are really dominating a fight your hitting head eyes, and your getting head eyesd"
madkow990,"I would rather revert to the .12 era back in early 2020 than what we have now. I don't give a shit about all the whinging about access to gear. I liked the freedom to ball out in a kit as long as I could afford it. Now with all the restrictions, insurance money sink price increases, and the cheater problem as large as ever, i don't even want to wear out a good kit if i can piece one together. Now it's not fun."
dantriggy,me and my team where just talkin about this and i love the ammo changes and armour changes.. makes for more interested and strategical game play instead of just relying on having better ammo
Insanity8016,"Some of the changes I feel were made in the right direction but I think people are mad because the people who leveled up fast were able to stockpile while others didn‚Äôt, still giving them an advantage. Personally, I saved 1.7k rounds of M80. These changes should have been implemented like the day of the wipe, not two weeks into it basically."
moose_338,I for one never asked for longer early or mid wipe. Too few and many underwhelming options for guns and gear that are just not fun to slogg through the same old quests again and again to get at the stuff I enjoy.
MrRook2887,We all did?
Aggressive-Try-5259,"The remaining issue is the stupid recoil of the guns, once good ammo is very rare now, there's no point in keeping guns with stupid recoil"
Kozak170,The thing is we aren‚Äôt fucking getting that at all because these changes are **fucking rolled out a week or two into the wipe** meaning the only change is that it‚Äôs only harder for new players to catch up. They do this shit on purpose to benefit streamers at this point. Every fucking wipe its the same story
OCWBmusic,"I think where you and I are going to find disagreement is the concept that BSG moved high tier ammo to FIR only and LL4 traders. That is, BSG did that with low to mid tier ammo while making top tier ammo virtually impossible to get after crafting.

Truthfully, I don't really get the argument that this extends mid wipe because what it effectively did was make game progression end the moment you complete Workbench Level 3."
Leytarkhan,"I agree mid wipes should be longer but their approach is just crazy especially doing it mid wipe when some allready had the opporturnity to stack up on high tear gear and the others now dont have that opporturnity anymore.

In general their approach is just not consistent. You have a Mosin with LPS GZH and SNB being easily found making it the single best weapon to run early wipe now and even late wipe its still really good low risk high reward but you cant have a SKS with PS ammo early wipe ?

Also locking things behind unfun and tedious quest is bad. I dont want to run around with no armor to kill some scavs, I dont want to use a iron sight bolt action to kill scavs at 40 meters when they can headshot me at 100meters, I dont want to go into dorms a highly contested zone for a dumb key and then go to the second most traversed zone to get a dumb pocket watch or having to be in pain and do something etc.

The quests I find fun are more survival oriented like get me x from y to get z in return that, clear map x of y many scavs as they disrupt the trade routes or go to location x and mark y etc. things that are real things these traders would need.

I dont mind quests but they have to be not tedious and make sense for the enviorment we are in but unfortunatly these quests are mostly arcady and poorly desgined and poorly thought out. I am glad that some early quests got changed but there are still massiv ammounts of bad quests.

I feel like their approach is just bad and not thought through at all as they often times make decisions from out of nowhere and not really take everything into account.

I am still not really affected by these changes as I exclusivly run VPO 209 as it is probably my favourit weapon in Tarkov. Its rather balanced as it has high recoil, low magazine capacity early on but therefore has some quality and easy to get mods and is only effective in the range of around 150meters as its bullets can easily sway on longer travel time."
ordinarymagician_,"You know why so many people are pissed?

It's not ""oh they made a change NOOO MY HECKIN WIPERINO"".

It's that they made this change mid-wipe right around when all their advertising team got far enough to not need to rely on non-maxed traders"
Wolf10k,I just want good performance but BSG don‚Äôt listen
oriaven,"I like the changes   but, it does make the grind harder, and we are getting closer to a point where we can't keep playing 6 month wipes.  We need the long or no wipe model / 1.0 release sooner than later."
STi-HawkEye,"M80 really didn‚Äôt need to be bumped to PK LL4 but needed it‚Äôs stats changed instead while remaining at LL3, maybe even behind a quest. 

I said it before and I‚Äôll say it again. M80, despite being a big bore round, isn‚Äôt particularly a penetrator. M855 has been known to be as good, if not better than M80 at penetrating barriers. It‚Äôs almost akin to like M193 55GR fmj being able to penetrate plates when shot out of a 20 inch barrel. While I like that BSG heard what I was saying long ago that m855 needed a buff and to make 55gr useful with them making 855 have 30 pen and fmj being the starter ammo, it wouldn‚Äôt ever be as realistic as it can get when bullet velocity is not a factor to armor penetration. Heck, SS190, based off SS109 which is m855 has an even higher pen value despite having less case space for propellant and a larger diameter projectile. This means less ass behind the round with less energy per square inch for penetration. M855 should pen even better than that, but ofc it‚Äôs the only way to make 5.7 pen armor without being just a pray and spray gun. There‚Äôs a reason why intermediate cartridges are king in actual use. M855 isnt even the best round from a practical standpoint, but it‚Äôs not shit like it is portrayed in game, even with the buff. 


Barrel length May matter, but they have to temper it heavily with ergonomic debuffs. .308 is a meta round because it hits like a truck, but to make an entry level round pen up to class 4 armor is stupid. Perhaps mid 30s for m80 at LL3 with a purchase quantity threshold would be a good measure. BCP FMJ could get a debuff to make the jump to m80 more worthwhile."
Fgw_wolf,Yes and I love it
Blue_Eyed_Brick,I wish we could have a wipe where every ammo with more than 40 pen is removed from the game entirely.
FaZelix,"I love the changes, most wipes i stopped playing after hitting max traders because you could just buy all the best shit and wear the same meta gear every raid and play only the best ammo and nothing really matters anymore. That just gets boring really fast. I hope they also make meta gun mods fir only so we get some variety in modding in the endgame. Building your own gun with what you have is way more fun that watching a vid on the meta build"
lonigus,I didnt ask for it.
M-Gnarles,"Rewards should come from raids and bartering themselves.   


It should never (outside some things like Kappa) be locked behind extremely dumb quests that suck life out of you. 

&#x200B;

I like to have everyone mode centered around mid level. Just dont force people to do stupid stuff, force them to play the game normally."
Henk87,"Problem is that heavy duty gamers will still have enough good ammo. 

Many play hardcore in the first weeks somewhat nonestop until hideout/traders are nearly maxed out.

After that they switch to interval raiding. With the hideout crafts its no problem for them to stock up during the day/week and then burn it for some raids.

Streamers have the ammon issue because they play nonestop.

Tldr. Remove high tier ammo crafts from hideout."
JackBadassson,It is not in level 4 traders it is just gone
BWG_Sleeper,"My only complaint with the changes has been that I've noticed a decent uptick in extract camping. I've been dying more this wipe than previous, but I can accept that. Extract camping is just the most frustrating aspect of the game and I really hope BSG does something to nerf that playstyle hard."
Diligent_Guard3451,game bad
rooster158,My toughts are that audio is ASS and desync is horrible and somehow headshots dont always do damage me and My friends Have countless of clips of this shit happening
SpawnofAres,Did they not say that once game gets later into development they would make high tier loot harder to get and more valuable? Why is everyone freaking out about this. It makes the game more interesting and changes up dynamics.
Veil_Of_Mikasa,I love the ammo change TBH. Now if the recoil wasn't weird I'd probably stop bitching about the game as a whole and just accept it as it is lol
TheRealChoob,Imo its shit changes. I can't buy ps12b and the craft is like 19hrs for 90. Laughable at best.
HowNondescript,Yeah this wipe sure is mid.
TsTyCZ,"The changes are ""fine"" imo. The real issue is BSG randomly deciding to do them 2 weeks after a wipe when all streamers / tryhards already got full ammo cases...  


Makes no sense at all imo.. probably changed by someone that has no clue about the game"
overwatchlap,"I'm more busy with Pokemon tera raiding right now, but it's a nice change."
wardearth13,"Haven‚Äôt seen a single cheater, streets is awesome, game is in the best state. Reddit haters git gud!"
Nice_2HEAT_You,"Hi my name is Redditdad4736. 

I work 120 hours a week and have two families. Therefore I can only play every second sunday between 8-9 PM where I repeatedly try to finish pocket watch quest but I get killed by cheaters every time I try!

All these nolifers that have time to play in the evening are handing my ass to me and I do not intend to improve. 

Gear should be harder to get! Nikita please fix!

&#x200B;

P.S. after month of grinding I managed to get level 3 traders but I cannot buy decent ammo/armor to compete with the nolifers! Nikia fix!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This sub man...."
StaticClingManXD,"They aren't listening to requests.... The plan was to always have high tier gear hard to get.

&#x200B;

He's just making the move slowly instead of just ripping off the band-aid. Wish he'd just rip it off.

&#x200B;

Back in the day with less playerbase he'd say: ""I'll do what I want, fuck you."" pretty much. Miss these days... But it seems with the overwhelming popularity of the game he's taking it slow as to not scare everyone away... Not because he wants more players or money but I believe it's to slowly show players it's THAT NOT BAD and to get them used to it... It's worked in the past... And continues to work.

&#x200B;

He sometimes still does the ""I don't care what you think, stop crying."" Stuff. Like the latest big example I can think of would be when he added GLs to the game and all the LAB rab content creators cried about it and he said... ""Nope they are staying the game, get over it."" BSGs way of ""balance"" is making things uber rare or insanely expensive, and it works.

&#x200B;

Every big feature people swore the game would ""die"" (whatever that means) and threatened to quit... Yet it keeps getting more and more popular.

\*OMFG MEDICAL ANIMATIONS? YOU'RE KILLING TARKOV STOP IT! OMFG HEAVY BLEED? YOU'RE KILLING TARKOV STOP IT! OMFG WEIGHT SYSTEM? YOU'RE KILLING TARKOV STOP IT. OMFG INERTIA? YOU'RE KILLING TARKOV STOP IT....\* Just silly as fuck.

&#x200B;

If he were to just remove flea market we'd have the same people crying about the game dying and then they'd realize in less than a few weeks it's a better game and it wasn't that big of a deal.

&#x200B;

Whatever these haters opinions are cause low IQ... He keeps delivering and he's been shown to be right more times than not. These haters keep playing the game for a reason.

&#x200B;

But yeah, always planned and the future will be more and more of this type of stuff.

&#x200B;

I'd say most players will be running lvl 3-4 armor with lvl 3-4 ammo and low-med budget guns as the rest of the stuff will be rare and will be a privilege to use. So instead of everyone running around with the best stuff with 0 worry of running out... You'll feel powerful when you do run the good stuff and you won't be seeing it non-stop. When you drop a ""chad"" with full META you'll know holy shit that guy is actually upset.. He's not just running back to re-gear... And now I got his uber loadout... MY TURN to be the big boi next raid. Etc.

&#x200B;

It will eventually get to this point where we are scavenging for things to craft the ""BiS"" stuff and people who have no gear fear now who have played for 10k+ hours may have it creep back to them as they won't have an infinite amount of the best shit.

&#x200B;

This is the way."
Competitive-Bad-401,Agree with you OP. Biggest complaint was the arms race and the Chad's that casual players had little to no chance with. No one likes SBMing or in this case GBMing so I believe these changes even the playing field for all. Hardcore players will still have the advantage because they play regularly but casuals still at least have a chance.
ZiggetyZapdos,"Just making it easier for streamers to have easy targets for longer in a wipe you mean. 

How are you dunce caps missing this? 

They just put a lot more players in a much smaller barrel for the streamers to shoot into. 

Yay."
Gamebird8,"Don't lop me in with you dimwits.  Late Wipe is the shit, and I didn't ask for none of this dumbshit"
SOVERElGN_SC,"What we are actually getting is just longer grind. Nothing changes at all, meta only shifts it‚Äôs face. Nikita can‚Äôt understand why early gameplay is something different and why it is much closer to EFT he designed and promised to deliver.
There is way to make EFT experience stay same as early wipe through all character progression and that what he should be seeking. He even knows exactly what to do to make it done but does some other things."
OMGitsSynyster,"I haven't made up my mind whether or not I like these changes.  I'm interested to see how the meta changes, and I'll wait to see how things play out this wipe before making any final judgements.  

I don't understand the M80 change or the SS190 one though.  SS190 isn't that good of a round to begin with.  M80 is good, but it is the bare minimum to make 7.62 NATO weapons decent.  I think they should revert the M80 change and reduce the amount of rounds you can buy per reset.  I already have PK LL4, but the change doesn't make sense to me from a game design perspective.

I also wish there were better barters for cooler looking tier-4 armors.  The game would be cooler if not everyone was using those ugly rigs and some variety was achieved."
