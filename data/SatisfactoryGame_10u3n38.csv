NotAlex33,My factory now has a slug carousel
Nitro159,This is going to elicit another *confused sigh* from my co-op factory building buddy when he discovers it.
theBosworth,You‚Äôve inspired me. Thank you.
rrusciguy,"Sing it with me kids! üé∂the slug on the belt goes round and round! Round and round! Round and round. The slug on the belt goes round and round, all through the factoryyyyyüé∂"
Saint_The_Stig,My first base on the west coast is built around a spire with a purple slug on it. I don't know what I would do if I ever found it missing from it's house.
Draundle,"I always make a lil roller coaster for em with various belt speeds to simulate the ups and downs, I hope they enjoy it as much as I do watching them zooming."
SuspiciousPrism,I got one right next to my HUB with goat chill playing on the boombox on repeat lmao
Mephistofelessmeik,"How do you do it? When I take them out of my inventory on the belt, she's not moving even when she sits perfectly on it"
WinthorpDarkrites,"Nice! And I see other are following your example too üòÅ

Now... If you guys can tell me where your factory is I'll come to take a look totally unrelated to the fact I'm out of slug juice for my world üò¨"
Melee130,My brother and I made a slime rollercoaster all around our base
ShadowMasked1099,Now I just want Power Slugs as decoration. As a plushie or something to stick to everything. Stick one in a little office and have them pretend to oversee everything. In game or IRL.
TCP_Tree,A slugosel?
Kaylinn83,"In my new playthrough I intent to add something funny or weird to each of my factories, this has just made it onto the list"
maiguee,Now my factory will have a slug carousel if my mf pc dont bluescreen when i try to run the game
Blueaced,Guess who is gonna copy your idea!
Schwabelbuting,How did you get this slug there
Jedirabbit12345,i did this with nuts
rwa2,"I have to post a photo of my conveyor sushi bar now, complete with green tea and carapace sushimi and stuff.

The main difficulty is that the food offerings tends to clump together over time when leaving the area.  Had to insert an extra splitter loop to get things evenly spaced out again."
Laalipop,I'm really sad yellow and purple slugs come out blue for whatever reason
B1ack7ce,I didn‚Äôt know I was missing this in my life until now.
sxlstrale,"Bro i have one running since like 2020, i thought i was the only one"
punkintentional,If that ain't mk5 it ain't worth it
GreyVersusBlue,I need to make a factory with walls first lol
knzconnor,Feel like it needs to be a slug sushi belt ü§£
digital_dreams,What's in the center?
Specht100,I have to copy that!
Dutchtdk,I dislike that you can never fill it up entirely with slugs without an obvious break where the line started
Shinxirius,"# Zoo

In our dedicated server, we made a zoo with seats in front of the windows, where about a dozen slugs go over a conveyor ""roller coaster"". This is where we log out, so there is usually at least one inactive player watching. Unfortunately, at the moment, all slug types render as blue."
ahumanrobot,Mk3 slug carousel here I come
ichbindulol_,can you do custom music in the music box?
DjBurba,Yes.
Yover13,how did you make it?
Mallardguy5675322,"I just slapped mine on my hub. I think there‚Äôs like 236 power slugs on there. Most of them are yellow, oddly enough"
wille179,"Slug *racetracks* are the way to go IMO, but yes a carousel is fine too."
