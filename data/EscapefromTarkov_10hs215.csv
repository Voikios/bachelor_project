Hithcock-Mac,Good shit.! Baby steps. You‚Äôll be a chad in no time
OccasionalJoint,Nice brother. Now the addiction really kicks in lmao
Fotogenlampa,https://mapgenie.io/tarkov
Atlas_Sun,Sometimes ya gotta get that item out! GG here‚Äôs to many more.
Solaratov,"As a brand new player, it's very valuable to use Offline mode to explore the maps. Not to be confused with co-op  mode which requires the Edge of Darkness upgrade, offline mode is available to everyone."
choos3wis3ly,"Best help I can offer is use your scav run every time it‚Äôs up. Don‚Äôt even worry about killing stuff. So far this wipe I‚Äôve run into very few aggressive player scavs, so you are almost guaranteed to be free to explore and loot.

This gets you a relatively consistent cash/item flow, and increases your knowledge of the maps and game flow without the risk of losing stuff on PMC runs."
O1_O1,They grow up so fast :'(
Ok-Yogurtcloset-4159,"Nice, so much more info to learn! Have fun it's addictive."
TeamGrippo,"We all started somewhere, it took me 3 wipes before I was even ‚Äúdecent‚Äù and I‚Äôm still hot garbage. Keep grinding"
Cyser93,"U got this!
2.5k hours player here, use the escape from tarkov fandom Wiki to Look maps up, helps a lot :)"
neikouxd,I wish I could play tarkov for the first time again.
DJ_Explosion,"*kisses half a bottle of toothpaste while taking a couple bullets out of my leg*

Worth it."
CenterCenterPolitik,Remember slow is smooth and smooth is fast.
Malviere,Very awesome. I just started last night and look forward to my first extraction.
Retsaottoaster18,Wait until you run into a dead PMC with a ton of gear on one of your random runs. You‚Äôll know the true feeling of adrenaline when you‚Äôre googling extracts on the map you‚Äôre on while you‚Äôre hiding with a ton of gear hahaha.
waituntilthis,"In case you dont know about him, pestily makes great tarkov vids for beginners/pros alike, he can really help you out"
Dr-Carnitine,you managed your first survive in a day? that took me almost a week
SamuelCish,"Customs is easy to get lost in because most of the maps online are upside-down.

My advice: pick one or two maps to learn. Customs and Woods are pretty friendly maps. 

[Here's a good map for customs](https://www.gamemaps.co.uk/game/tarkov/maps/customs_3d_real_north_day_Re3mr)

Remember if you game time is AM or PM, this will help you determine North and make navigation easier until you unlock the compass."
Zumbert,"Savor it, it might not feel like it right now, but the learning phase can be some of the most heart pounding memorable experiences you can have in the game.

Eventually you will become desensitized to it all, so really take it in while you can"
Kikidog23,"I got level 2 before I even got into a raid. 
No I didn‚Äôt do a scav raid. 
I researched very possible thing I could before doing a raid

Got lvl 2.

Learn how armour and bullets work. And you holding an angle doesn‚Äôt mean u will kill a guy when he walks into you. But every time someone holds and angle you will die.
- quote of the day"
PM-ME-YOUR-TITS,Godspeed son
fluffhead42O,Nice!!! This is my first wipe too. I was so fking stoked to get my first extract. Took me like 8 raids. I have about 80 hours in and I'm addicted...I'm getting better but man is the learning curve high. Solo only player btw
SPCGMR,Mapgenie.io is your friend.
ledmetallica,"I love hearing stories of first time players. I relate to them with my early stories as well! Enjoy your time in Tarkov! You will hate it to it's core before you love it. Then you'll hate it even more, then you'll love it significantly more.

...it's a very abusive relationship"
jkerpz,How the fuck do you know where the extracts are? i just run around until i eventually die because i have 0 clue where extracts are.
Effective-Category86,Congrats. It's not easy and customs is a chad process map. Keep a second monitor or a tablet with map open always. Map genie you have have just locations and extracts only on it if you want and it makes it a lot easier
8BitAsbestos,Use mapgenie.io to help you learn stuff in maps
HappyFoxtrot,That is awesome ! Welcome to Tarkov !
JosephGrappe,That‚Äôs awesome! Are you typically trying to run your raids in the early mornings?
SnakeeeDoctor,Hell yea! It's a long grind to learn the game but that's a huge rush to survive your first one! Congrats man.
unfoldingevents,"If you need help sen my a dm, can guide you if you like."
-McFresh,Yooooo congrats man!  Will you be on around 9 pm eastern time tonight? If so dm me.
Devon_AJ,Your addiction will become more extreme once you reach level 15
DJDan_96,Try the off line raids to learn the maps interchange is easy to get out when you outside
pooder27792,GG shit so addicting
coconutlogic,I would use a map guide or watch some videos of how to get oriented with the maps. It can be very confusing.
AlexArkham,"We all started like that, so you're doing well. Stick with it, and try to not let anger take over when bad things happen!"
2fry,"Con fucking gratz man. I was just talking to my friend yesterday how I really wish I had footage of when I first started playing. I remember everyone saying ""don't worry we were all that bad and you get better"". So.. don't we were all that bad and you get better, enjoy every victory üòÅ"
artisan-,"5th wipe player here..
Still remember my first extract..
I literally raised my hands and needed a walk in the room making air fists..
Keep rocking it.
U will learn the maps..
GG"
SignorFreeze,"I remember the feeling of not knowing where I am, what to do and using the wiki for guidance, good times.. you'll get the grip soon and that will be an even better feeling. Enjoy your time and welcome to Norsvinsk."
Haymush,Well done!
-TAAC-Slow,Use the many map tools to learn extracts. Use the offline mode to practice finding those extracts. Use your scav every time you can
kreynlan,"How did you manage to get a run through on customs? I'd have to be b-lining it to extract to make it there under 10 minutes, never mind scavs and pmcs"
CRU1Z3R,"I finally started really playing this wipe, previously I played a couple of times a few wipes ago. Literally just spawn in with a buddy run around get lost and that was it. But finally this time playing getting in and out of raids pretty well on my own. Kinda addicted at the moment."
Rk0,Only a matter of time before he starts yapping the game is still in beta.
ErifSenpai,Keep going manüî•üî•
Electrical_Buy_8647,Jiminy_Chronic I'm still learning the maps myself.
jetski1105,Do you have discord ? Send me a Dm. I can help
juitar,Map knowledge is a big part of the game. Congrats!
Dr_Be2t,"Play woods, its a much easyer map for beginners"
Deimos_PRK,"Play with your scav as much as you can or offline (only with your PMC) if you want to learn maps/practice, you can't do missions (except FIR (Found In Raid items)) with your scav. If you have no more equipment in your stash, no money, use your scav, it's always just free loot. Having a higher reputation to Fence will reduce the wait time for your scav and give you better equipements on your scav but having lower rep will do the opposite (longer time and worse equipment) if you're at 6 rep, others scav BOT will follow you and bosses won't shoot you, if you're at -6, others scav BOT will automatically shoot you. You get reputation by surviving a raid with your scav or killing a scav that just killed or shot another scav, you lose rep by killing another scav (all this as a scav (if you shoot a scav by accident and he shoots you back, killing him will make other scavs come for you, if you kill them you'll keep losing rep (if you lose rep it'll usually be more than what you earned (so for example, you kill a scav and lose 0.10 reputation but you will only get 0.001 per raid survived)))) so if you're a scav just don't shoot anyone, it's better just dying since it's not your loot anyway. You should watch as many game tutorials as you can and keep in mind that the Tarkov wiki is always your friend (there's cool maps on it, it explains everything, missions, items...)"
Complex_Teaching1872,Use map genie
Berkee_From_Turkey,"Keep in mind that when fighting, map knowledge is about 60% of the fight Imo. Learning where people can come from, where they're most likely to pull back to, where they'll flank from, is key to winning fights. The more you run those maps, the more you die and survive the more you'll learn where to go and where not to! Good luck homie I got like a full wipe, wipe and a half before I learned how to play the game well"
cooprtc3,"Let me know if you want someone to play with, me and my buddy are both semi-new but can find our way around. Teen friendly!"
TheRock3tBunny,"Awesome. Last wipe was my first and i hated customs, I didnt know it and it made me nervous. This wipe I like it way better and know it a lot metter. Map knowledge helps so much"
Few_Ad648,"Keep it up! If you‚Äôre having trouble learning maps try offline. Be sure to use the gear you would use in an actual raid so you don‚Äôt get used to using your best gear unless you‚Äôre actually going to be using that gear consistently. 
And use your scav! Always scav lol easiest way to make money. You can make at least 500k a run if you know what you‚Äôre looking for. I scav on customs and just run through the stashes and a few buildings and make it out rich."
ResponsibleYou2525,"Fuck yea, CHAD incoming!"
jmenendeziii,use a map to start ([mapgenie.io](https://mapgenie.io)) but as soon as you feel comfortable without it stop using it. Also dont be afraid to run shit kits like mosins or sks and put the extra ammo in your secure container so you arent blowing through ammo. Offline mode helps a lot too
Agreeable-Ad-2334,Just dont end up resorting to cheating and its all good
Mediocre_Soil_3200,Nice. Great feeling. Excited for your to get your first back pack full of PMC remains!
NastySteeze,"Ah, keeping your dignity for a raid is the best thing you can bring back!"
Ok-Life8294,"You don't learn anything if you play with others. Just continue playing solo. You'll die 90% of the time until you don't. But that's how you learn. Playing in groups as a new player is how you turn into a little bitch later on. Play solo, you'll be a better player."
poopystinks21,Just have a map up on another screen or your phone and you will learn it over time
YcktaranGuilds,"Well done, Customs can be pretty ruthless. Try offline raids to get to know the maps better!"
Miserable_Tax_5911,jsut made a reddit acount to say good job and keep on going freind!
SamuelCish,"If you're ever looking for a duo partner, send me a DM. I've been playing for only a week, myself. So it'd be nice to learn the ropes with someone."
ZuperChillain,Hell yeah! Onto the next one!
inkjet456,"If anyone here needs help as a newbie, I can help ya out! I‚Äôve played about 5 ish wipes now so I know the game pretty well. DM me and we can run some raids :)"
the_mil,"Hell yeah man  


scav run as much as possible when you are learning, its free money"
AverageDad_86,"Welcome to Tarkov, it's fun and stressful"
ItsJustDog,Happy for you! Welcome to the community!
asnith,Need someone to play with? I'd be happy to help and teach!
CeoOfLighthouse,Love to see the amount of upvotes this post gets. A lot of us forget when we first started out and how sick it was to just SURVIVE a raid.... nice job homie.
TsRebornz,Welcome to Tarkov
Homelessdonut,I'm confused why aren't you bitching about the game like everyone else?
QueenAnneRevennge,"An easy way to reliably extract even though you don't know the map and don't know where the extracts are, is to follow the edge of the map in either direction because you will eventually be brought to extract. Works on most maps too."
Ruttley,"Laugh now, but this man is going to be absolutely gooning on us this time next year"
aerosikth,"I was there about 2 weeks ago! Now I‚Äôm getting out the majority of my raids, even on factory! All about baby steps, find a play style that suits you don‚Äôt try to follow what the chads on twitch do"
gloriusllama,"This reminds me of my kid being so excited to tell me he was able to ride his bike for the first time, but only went a few feet before falling. Welcome to tarkov my friend! Good luck we were all in your position in the beginning."
Broad-Ship,Let‚Äôs go!!!!
goonerider,"HEY MAN, i am in the same boat, i just run scavs until i am familiar with the map then start to run PMC. There is a trade off, i get a ton of money and learn high tier loot runs and if you get lost who gives a hoot, youre a scav"
senorshady,Pm me your discord and in game name ill play with you
ZMAC698,Lol
sc0tt3h,"You can hit level 3 by identifying items before even stepping into a raid. Seems you are ""addicted"" after playing the game like twice.."
byrfx,Where are you from. Do you want to play together today? I can help you a bit
lebowskipei,"Who ever down votes this doesn't appreciate the struggle, sorry you don't."
flatspotting,Maybe play through customs twice offline first lol - its super super easy to learn its just a rectangle.
JimmyNuggets,I'm level 7 and so far have 0 PMC kills! Fingers crossed I'll get my first one any day now...
MisterMagoooooo,"‚ÄúStay here, stay as long as you can‚Äù"
crakinshot,"Open this map: https://mapgenie.io/tarkov/maps/woods
you can right-click on extracts to just show those. Also highlight the caches. Kit your guy out and start a new PMC run and explicitly choose practice run. Learn the map that way without losing stuff. You can also increase the AI amount and difficulty. If you want to practice fighting, same again but on factory. If you're not confident, you can so scav runs before doing PMC."
Accomplished-Fly7837,"I'm 2,056 rubles plz teach me your ways"
Amagnumuous,"I take my scav to interchange and when I hear footsteps too close to avoid I hit F1 which makes the scav start yelling. I do this to intentionally alert whoever it is that I am a scav. Then I listen to hear if they do the same back. If I don't hear the scav call back I immediately prepare for a fight and get on VOIP to say I am a friendly scav and ask if they are friendly as well. I only resort to shooting as a scav when I think I am being engaged. So far I've rarely been killed by other player scavs, typically only when I am geared up and look like a PMC (scav with the camo pants and a black hoodie is doomed if he gets geared up). It can benefit you to keep a cowboy hat on. When I get surprised by someone up close I'll typically start doing jumping 360s to show them I'm not going to engage and buy myself time to assess the situation while I avoid any shots they might take if they are a pmc. I usually make 100-300k every time I do this and I've even met friendly PMCs and taken the co-op extract too!"
Ghauldidnothingwrong,"Hell yeah congrats dude! And welcome to hell, it‚Äôs addicting, painful and the most fun I‚Äôve had since Halo 3."
SirKane15,Congratulations on your first survival. Now you've gotten a real taste you won't be able to stop. You will never escape from tarkov.
zeimusCS,You can get level 2 without entering a raid
Homer0721,The thing with this game is to assimilate that dying a lot is part of the mechanism of this game lol
Puzzilan,I spent my first 7 hours of the game dying on factory over and over.  Keep it up buddy
parkin_lot_pimpin,"The biggest thing when youre new to this game is just knowledge accumulation. Check out Pestily's Raid series, theres a handful of seasons to choose from, gives a nice insight"
Appropriate_Baker919,"ah man i remember when i first started, the rush you get when you make it out with anything, even just a shitty scav gun üòÇ, or the rush of your first player kill. This game sucks you in fast, i remember when i had like 10 hours and now im sitting at just over 3000 üòÇ"
NUTCHIEFNUT,Hey i just started out too. Don't know much about the game but if you put something in your pouch it gets saved even if you die
SUNTZU_JoJo,"Welcome to Tarkov buddy!

Go on the EFT official discord and find some likeminded people to play with, will help a lot.

Try and find newer folks or get a 1-on-1 with an experience guy willing to teach you.

This game is hell when you're on your own completely...some simple things you could've never realised solo, like (currently there is no point slow-crouch-walking as it's as loud as walking normally) and (turning makes a twisting sound, that and ADS-ing and checking your inventory all make world sounds other players can hear FAR away {further than you think})"
Alehcks,"Bro, congrats, it's the start of something beautiful and awful! I third partied 2 2 man teams today in Interchange, I grabbed what I could, but just on those 4 bodies I was ready to go. Any player scavs who found those bodies probably thanked Jesus, so much left behind I couldn't carry D:"
lncep710n,Congratulations and every time you play is a chance for improvement.  Good luck out there.
TheKingofSoup,Once you solo squad wipe you'll be hooked forever
aling0521,Pretty much the same for me.  Bought the game yesterday. I played offline in Shoreline for a while to get a feel for the map and try to find the exfils. Finally did a scared raid and made it out with a few items. Every time I loaded in after that I was killed in under 3 minutes. Now I don't have hardly anything. lol Let's hope today is a little better.
Invicturion,The feels are real. I killed a lvl 2 Timmy yesterday on Customs... 12g to the face. No ragrats

gggrrraaannnttt,"I'm convinced that one of the biggest barriers for newer players is getting lost and not being able to escape. I know for me, that was one of the most frustrating aspects of the game when I started."
Ivaris,Don't go customs on low level. Try woods. Customs id a PvP heavy map with mandatory PvP zones in all routes to extracts
tugrulserhat,Man I wish I could start like you :) Been like 3 years since my first day in tarkov. Now I'm just another chad lvl 40 3 weeks into wipe with %65 survival rate :/
ElHuntar,add me sandmask lets squad up lol i just started also lvl 12

Bobolett,"If you want a partner for some very nooby duos add me! Ign: bobolet

Haven't liked being grieved for my shitty callouts lol"
Tyson303,First of many
Luc1dNightmare,"make sure you save a few maps to your pc (and open them with 3D paint, it uses less RAM). Put them in the background and run the game in borderless so you can easily tab out. This sight has the best maps.

https://www.eftmaps.net/"
Gafrudal,No please stop while you're ahead
DtForrest,Learn the maps in practice mode so you don‚Äôt have to get destroyed by pmc‚Äôs and player scavs.
Crashty,Nice! what item did you get out?
logskynei,"That's awesome my dude. This is my first wipe and I had to figure shit out quick. Best advice I can give is mapgenie and scav runs to get your money up as well as to gain knowledge of loot spots, the map in general and how to do combat. My guess is your PMC is broke so scav running is a great way to get to know the maps before you bet your inventory on them"
Spirited_Ad_9588,"So innocent, so naive, so pure."
cmmcdow3ll,"The fact you got a run through on customs when your trying to survive shows you gave the same skill issue I suffer from. Going too fast. 

Slow. Down. 

Sprinting around, I will hear you and kill you. 

Running without good C&C, I can see you and kill you. 

No route planning (this comes with time and map knowledge and just playing) can help expedite your trip to the main menu. 

I‚Äôd recommend (this is what I‚Äôm currently doing with streets) loading in, find where you are on the map, then plan your full route. ONLY sprint if you: have no C&C, or are getting shot at. 

Everything else comes with time. Slow down. Hang in there pall."
KakosNikos,"That's absolutely normal. EFT is a horror game, don't let people tell it's a fps and bs like that."
Tlomz27,"Learn to scav on woods, it's a slower map that's great for money."
R-MagicMare,Lol is it bad I am thinking about playing tarkov as my next onlyfans content drop? üôàüòÖ
BeamsAdept,Congratulations ! Welcome to the game !
egiantmirror_skilled,Extract camp. Best way to get good juice without needing to risk anything
SunAndCigarrets,"Good job friend, I still remember being lost on woods on my first raid, nothing beats that feeling!

Just a tip I wish i was given back in the day, start on factory, learn to pvp and to fight the AI, its an easy map to learn and you will get tons of exp (if you survive). Best of luck!"
DtiChl,Good job! Don't forget to play your scav when possible since it's also useful to learn the maps and you can track where other experienced scav players check for loot.
Brosintrotogaming,Fire up that interactive Tarkov map. Super helpful to have open. Just a quick alt+tab away
Methichi,"Don‚Äôt know if someone has said this yet, grab a kit, go factory and change scavs to horde mode. Just learn how to move around in fighting situations"
StealthCatUK,Great job. Welcome to Tarkov!
Ryan_jpg,Glad to see new players can still enjoy the game
extramediumweldone,"Be patient my man. You will soon be in love, hate, anger, piss off then delete the game later."
LilithuZ,Welcome to Tarkov my friend! :D
PhigmentTV,Make sure you do scav runs too to get more experience in the map
TheGreenScreen1,"Recommend lighthouse and interchange for scav runs when you‚Äôre new. 

Interchange supermarket will give you plenty of food early so you don‚Äôt need to pay Therapist. 

Lighthouse is just GOAT for loot to make money. Always as scav  come out with 200k+. 

Streets of Tarkov the new map is also insanely good for loot but requires patience as has server/performance/hacker issues."
WannaHate,"Pro tip: always wear a headset, any kind of it. Its legit WALLHACK, nobody would be able to sneak onto you, you can even hear enemies pull out grenades, meds or reload, you can even hear them rotating in place or looting"
Exitium_Deus,The game has a huge learning curve but just focus on customs for now and keep at it. I was like you last wipe and this wipe all of that learning and building blocks are in place and I'm killing it.  If you can find some friends too that's always fun! Good luck!
No-Phase2131,"Should feel really good.
The start is the best.
Tarkov can be super frustrating but the rewarding feeling you get sometimes is strong."
Relevant_Parsnip_479,"I posted on here a while back at absolute rock bottom. I just kept trying and learning. In getting tasks done, have a stash full of guns meds and ammo, I even managed to save up for a scav junk box too at 1.1m. Never give up."
SLOGMaster9000,"This makes me really happy. I‚Äôm 5 wipes in with 1300 hours and I miss how the game used to be when I first started. Scared to make every turn, dying over and over again, the pure adrenaline rushes. It‚Äôs the only thing that keeps me playing, it‚Äôs the only game that actually makes my heart pump like a workout. Except now it only gets me going after I drop multiple people since I‚Äôm so desensitized"
Monster_Dick69_,"If you have a second monitor, tablet or even a phone use mapgenie.io they have Tarkov maps. Customs is fairly easy to find where you are by looking around. Spatial orientation is super helpful in Tarkov and may come in handy irl. 

Customs when looking at mapgenie is pretty easy to navigate. 

Woods? That was a bit more difficult since it largely looks the same depending on where you spawn"
MarkyRust,"3 key points.

- Map knowledge
- rotations
- Gunplay (when to spray, when to swing etc.)"
qdubbya,"Heck yeah man! It‚Äôs a rush. Good job.

Few things that helped me and still help me tremendously.

Tarkov Wiki - all the information you could ever need.

Pull up a map on the second monitor if you have one. If not, pull one up on your phone or tablet. I personally use mapgenie.io but they have some on the Wiki as well. 

Search EFT Ammo - it‚Äôs not the gun that matters‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the ammo. Learn how ammo works and how armor works. Ton of YouTube videos out there.

Search YouTube for beginning tips/keybindings..

Knowledge is power, my friend. 

In the beginning I‚Äôd just grab every item I could then search on the wiki if I needed it. You‚Äôll get to the point you‚Äôll know what to take. Use the wiki to show you which items you‚Äôll need for hideout and quest items after you get more comfortable.

Also, you will die‚Ä¶ a lot. We all die. Masochist in us all.. love getting punched in the dick by Tarkov.

Finally - just have fun. It‚Äôs a game."
TheFunkadelicOne,"Bro, 4 years ago when I first started playing this game my 1st raid was on customs. A friend of mine had already played through a wipe and sherpa'd me through the map showing me the extracts. He recorded the entire video. I just watched it before this wipe started and cheesed at how skittish I was. Now when I play any map but lighthouse and streets I just book it. After a while you'll know the spawns of the players and scavs. You'll get your timing down and know around how much time is left in the match when player scavs start to spawn in, you'll memorize all of the choke points and high traffic areas and you'll have a better feeling for the flow of the raid. Cheers bro, keep going."
fr1daydk,"Nice, I'm level 3 I get shoot in the head from nowhere everytime, I hate this game so much lol."
540565,Ahh yes sounds very familiar to my first wipe :) keep at my friend. Use the wiki for everything that's my best advice.
billydeewilly,Get some buddy
Castam3r3,Always try to have a right pick instead of left pick since on right pick only the gun and a little of the head and arm show up. while if you do a left pick you expose your whole body.
Careful-Scallion7517,Take those first baby step and find a rhythm that works for you. If it's just lurking in the shadows avoiding everyone do it. Or guns blazing do it but find that rhythm that works.
commieswine90,Hell yeah! Keep after it man!
CtL_ishere,"Factory is good for figuring out the fighting mechanics.

animal1988,"Man I hear you! I started last Friday... My sleep schedule and work performance has suffered, I'm setting hard boundaries for playing work nights now. it took most of last Saturday before I was finally able to extract with pliers, a screwdriver, 2 measuring tapes and a wrench on Interchange with my PMC in a night raid. I swore my heart going to beat out of my chest. when you get to that map, GOSHAN and OLI will be your best friends, extracted with a backpack full of food/drink once."

GibbyMTG,"Offline raids are good. Go in with beat gear, hotkey your meds. And just have fun killing scavs oj factory or customs. I had a buddy try this and he went from killing 1 or 2 scavs taking a lot of damage to killing 12 and feeling way better."

TECHNOV1K1NG_tv,"Just wait til you get your first kill on a juice lord PMC. You'll be literally shaking while you scramble to take all his gear, then the rest of the raid your heart is pounding 100 bpm as you just try to get to the fucking extract but there are about a dozen scavs in your way and you blast through them with the dead chad's meta gear only to barely make it to extract with two heavy bleeds and all your limbs missing. That's when the addiction truly starts."
Bradur-iwnl-,This kind of makes me smile. Just a random dude being proud of his first survival! Get em boy!
Tru3insanity,I feel ya. Im level 3 and die horribly almost every time on pmc but im scavving loot consistently enough. Found a level 5 body armor im not gunna touch with a 10 foot pole. Making it out with that was an insane feeling.

AceJog,"Learn shoreline, and do Scav runs in the dark."
General_Gopnik27,"Hell yeah man, soon enough you‚Äôll be able to kill scavs with ease. Keep up the good work!"
cwilcoxson,Congrats
justwantedtoview,I ran customs offline repeatedly till I could just peck scavs while moving quick. Id never watched a guide just kept trying till I felt like I could go online. Keep going dude.
Fantasyfr3ak,"Yo, way to go! I have friends who played before I started, so it was an easy learning curve for me. Unless you just don't want to, you could always pull up a map while your playing, or even better you could always practice learning the map layouts in offline mode. Good luck to you."
Jjlred,"Congrats friend, I remember my first successful raid was one of the most exhilarating game experiences I‚Äôve ever had.  Welcome to the club!"
willy--wanka,"Watch streamers more man, you'll get some good routes and tips to help you out."
Genuzai,"Good shit! Keep at it, this game is all about knowledge so keep building on what uyouve learned.
What country are you in? 
There's prolly some folks here that can give you some raids together to help speed up some important map knowledge of the likes of customs woods and interchange."
BlackberryStatus7944,That‚Äôs sick. I‚Äôm a level 8 and chads keep butt fucking me everytime I‚Äôm almost extracting with my challenge item
Jelenfellin9,I killed a level 2 on customs recently and stashed his gear for him. If you had an m4 with a commando rig I hope it was insured.
joecuping, I rarely play but I love watching others play. id like to get into it again but I feel like my ears will explode for how loud everything is
Toxic-Mist,"Are you... Me? 

Just got my first survive today, granted I had a Sherpa but still! 

This game is much harder solo especially if you are just starting"
AWSullivan,Nice work. This game has the lowest of lows and highest of highs. Stick with it.
WannaBee42069,"Very good, now do this a couple of time and watch streamers and youtubers playong and you will be chad in no time. You vould also search for the map on the internet for the map you are on so its easier to navigate around."
namhhgames,"When I first started, I wanted to revenge the sniper that killed me when I go beyond the map boundary in custom‚Ä¶ I just kept looking for him üòÇ"
fluffhead42O,"My dude...this is my first wipe ever. I'm lol 13. Today I made the shot of my life on woods. Sks w a 4x scope...150m away inside a door just over the top of a forklift. Headshot on a lvl 40. Had to aim up just to make the shot. All my pain with this game vanquished in one shot. I'm now addicted to tarkov, have mercy on my soul"
LoanAdministrative,Roadtochad! Keep going!
peepeepoopooman347,getting your cheeks clapped today gigachad clapping cheeks tomorrow
Setesh57,"If you've got a second monitor, having Map genie open on that second monitor is a huge boon"
Ornery-Art-9474,good stuff dude you‚Äôll only get better trust i got the game 2 weeks ago and have been having more fun with getting better
Competitive-Ad-4822,"Play on a hard scav difficulty offline. Better armor and ammo will help with surviving. Don't peak same spot twice, learn exits. Discord is nice to have people take toy though a map you don't know"
Mokk92,Id recommend watching Pestilys raid series on youtube. He has maybe 5 or something seasons where he explains how the game works!
flurmatt,You watching YouTube vids or you rawdogging it?
QuinndianaJonez,"Hahaha, I'm so sorry."
spiritriser,"Customs is a nightmare to navigate to be honest, try interchange, it's not a bad introductory map since you can easily navigate based on where the mall is in relation to you."
onlykshitij,That feeling of having absolutely no idea where you are but finding an extract is so good lol
PitrekTwojkrol,"Yoooo, nice. If you want any help with quests like protection or Keys hit me up."
frozenfrostyy,Custom stick to the whole perimeter of the map and learn some hidden stashs more confidence go inland a bit more and have a map open
DomiCrash,"Nice, do you have any youtubers to watch or guides to read to get you started? maybe to learn the map a little, the ammo system and so on. its really complex and it definitely needs time but you‚Äòll get there"
Lamazing1021,It only gets more addicting lol.. good work
PraporsLibido,The addiction gets far worse but its a great game. Im sitting at a 62% survival rate at level 23. This is my 3rd wipe and i remember the first couple weeks playing the game were the most punishing. Customs is extremely PVP heavy in my opinion compared to other maps. Learn Shoreline. Great loot. Pvp heavy in the resort but most of the time the rest of the map is pretty calm so you can kinda decide how you wanna play it going in. I love that map
JadenAUT,"if you want to ***practise PVP go factory***, you got pretty much every element of PVP except long range fights in there + its nearly impossible to avoid PVP. it usally doesnt take long for either you getting a kill or you dieing  to a player or scav. the map has a max raid timer of 15mins and very close spawns, so maybe check out the map in offline first. this is btw the only time you should use offline mode in my opinion. learning where other players spawn, loot early on and then roam around is an essential thing to know on any map. you will most likely die a lot while findings this out, but more and more will get a sense for the pathways players usually take. this gives you either the opportunity to engage others or even avoid them. pestily has some very helpful videos on player spawns, you should check him out.  


edit: i tend to play carefully and im anything else than a chad, got 1k hours, playing on and off for about 4 years and i only manage to have a surival rate with 30% and a KD of 2.8 so dont worry the game is hard for all of us :'D"
seth-ebear,"I would recommend factory right away, small easy to learn extracts, and you can get used to being absolutely bodied by another player"
Rude-Artist435,The games shit mate. Get out early. Developers make cheats. Sell those cheats ban half those cheats for the cheaters to buy the new cheats developers make. Just stay away.
AdvancedToe1585,Just use the wiki or genie maps bruh
