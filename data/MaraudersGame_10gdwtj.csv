Randomstarwarsfan,Currently me and my two brothers have been doing runs with the capital ship and you are Practically invincible with 2 rockets launchers… players can’t even make it to escape pods before dying to the damage lol
SLDR80,Where did you find 4 supply drops?

doeraymefa,"Depends how you wanna play. It is very time consuming to run back to stash loot in the ship. And crates mostly give money and a couple good guns. I usually only take the KA or Small Supply Drops for the L1A1 rifle and attachments. 

I personally prefer to just hunt players for guns/armor/meds, which are the only items I value and desire in this game. Everything else is a dime-a-dozen and so plentiful that gathering it is never an issue.

But ships do have advantages in groups and for rat-type players. Although it does mean more risk, more reward, which is sometimes contrary to how rats want to play.

Overall, the advantages don't align with the majority of people's aspirations in Marauders. Hopefully Devs correct that in future updates"
