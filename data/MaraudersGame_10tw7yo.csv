Basically the game doesn't have enough space on your graphics processor to actually load all the assets and things it needs to run.

By any chance do you know the exact model of laptop (should be on the bottom on a white sticker) you have i can look the specs up and give you an idea of how big a mismatch there is between what you have and what you need."
JebstoneBoppman,"Looks like your computer can't run the game, if it's a non gaming laptop, it probably has a bare bones onboard gpu.  


Check one of the can i run it checkers online by putting in your laptop specs."
Mythicguy,"Unfortunately bub it seems like the game ain't gonna run on your hardware, at least with current settings. 

Try turning the resolution down in settings, it'll look worse but it'll play better."
Clutch_Cabbage,If you have a lightning or a USB-C you could try an eGPU
Amaninthetrees,"As an above commentor said, your graphics card simply isn't up to the task. You can try running potato settings, but your time is limited for modern FPS with your current rig.

If you're running into this issue with marauders, it's definitely time for an upgrade.  
This game isn't demanding for modern specs by any means, even my old rx580 8gb crushed it. Cant use my old Alienware Alpha r1 for it as 2gb of Vram just doesn't work with anything beyond indie sidescrollers in the year of our lort 2023(2).  

Unfortunately that means either a tower (full build that you can update later) or a laptop (that should last 5-ish years). Desktop will be cheaper in the long run but is more intensive to set up in terms of cost and time.   

The main reply gave you some assistance with laptops, let me know if you'd like some help building a desktop."
Conmanjames,get the minimum required memory. or try lowering the resolution and/or closing any other programs running.
MediocreCowboi,dont even bother playing your saving yourself the misery of constantly crashing with no reconnect
j_rapp,Not worth the time investment to get around this with your laptop. Just get a better laptop or PC

Yes it is for an amd laptop but I wouldn't be surprised if your intel laptop did the same thing"
