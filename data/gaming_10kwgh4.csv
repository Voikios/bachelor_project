SRevanM,Bad take. Kratos would actually break down the tree and then build a structure from which to shoot his guns
tacotouchdown14,🍴 bad.
CaptinHavoc,Like Master Chief from Fortnite?  Like Thanos from Fortnite?  Like Goku from Fortnite?
GonnaGoFat,I just bought this game played about 2 hours of it last night. I had to stop playing during this fight as it was 5am and figured I should have gone to bed.
piecwm,Like Thanos from Fortnite. Like Naruto from Fortnite. Like Rick and Morty from Fortnite. Like Son Goku from Fortnite. Like Master Chief from Fortnite. Like Spider-Man from Fortnite.

They made whole shows out of the goku and naruto skins, wrote a whole book and 2 different movies based on the dune skins, the master chief, Kratos, and Laura croft skins have all gotten full game series


Hell, even some real artists like Travis Scott and Ariana grande actually started out as fortnite skins believe it or not


And thats to say nothing of the multimedia empire that was built based on the ""marvel series"", ""DC series"", and ""star wars series"" sets, these are some of the most profitable IPs out and they are all based on humble fortnite skins"
heybudbud,"I teach elementary music, and we begin every class with a movement activity and a listening selection before beginning the main lesson. 

The amount of times I've heard ""hey, that's that Fortnite song"" drives me nuts lol."
CNE_Spooders,Oh yay the most bland unfunny overrused joke on the internet again

Crunkbutter,"Oh my God, ladies and gentlemen, it's fortnite himself!"
DI0nysOO2,I can’t believe how they made Chris Hemsworth fat
FancyFeller,"I've actually had good things happen from people playing Fortnite. I've never played it myself, not the biggest fan of FPS or Battle Royales (except the movie) but when they introduced El Chapulin Colorado, all of a sudden I saw kids looking up and getting into old El Chavo del 8. And that's sounds great. My parents grew up with it and then when I was a kid in the early 2000s I too grew up with it. And it's great knowing that it might inadvertently make the next generation of kids that weren't even raised in a LatAm household tangentially aware of the works made by Chespirito. 

I see all the characters being added as way to easily introduce these characters from fiction to kids. Go right ahead, sounds like a win. No need to hate it gatekeep. If they're really interested, they will learn the characters names, play the games and watch the shows all by themselves. Let people enjoy things naturally, damn."
molohunt,Love how they still animated him taking 1 step back like oh fuck is he really about to do this lolol

Prototype_4271,Oh come on nobody would ever say that
Captain_Kuhl,Reddit when literally anyone makes a guest appearance in Fortnite:
AngleStudios,Kratos has never seen such bull*hit.
Rastabrotha,"A shifting labyrinth, creative overworld puzzles, a gank city area or two. Some more wandering bosses, like one that comes from the ocean or jumps down from a big tree. Actual armor customization. Wacky, stupid spells. Creative crystal tears, i.e. turns you invisible, un'lock-on'able, makes you float slowly in the air, makes you so heavy your steps shake the earth like godfrey. NPC invade that take the piss like in dark souls 2 (that shit was hilarious). Karate fist like in ds2. The ringed knight spear from ds3. Just port it please. Ashes of war/spells that summon like spirit ashes for the funny. Powerstance shields i guess. Official mod ports (i can dream). Temporarily taming simple overworld creatures. 

Just one of these, any of these and I'd be happy"
MercyReign,"Kray Kray doing krazy things, as usual……"
Piggstein,"Fortnite bad, kids today, grumble grumble updoots to the left"

T2_the_rex,"I had this happen to me today. Friend said ""You know Doomslayer? That new guy in Fortnite?"" I slapped him for it. I'm so glad I haven't touched Fortnite once, this whole generation of people believing everything comes from Fortnite and/or referencing everything through it hurts me."
SeatStealer,"“Hey kid, he’s actually a guy from this really cool game, it was really fun, you should play it when you’re older”"
asergb,And this is why kratos never runs out of raging flame
Zombieemperor,Theres a boat conversation that indicates at least one of the crossover fighting games is cannon but IDR which

pluckydeficiency_845,"Oh, come on, that would never be spoken."
yawn1337,Fortnite actually asks you to build skill by learning to build for example. God of war is just a movie with button mashing inbetween.
DriverIll3169,It saddens me thinking just how many younger next generation games will genuinely think that for so many characters in gaming now lol.
NyteMyre,"I was playing Onward VR last time with some kids in the game, and they were all like...

TitularFoil,"I would consider Kratos to be the face of Playstation at this point.

Like I feel growing up it used to be either Crash or Spyro. But it was also a weird transition because I wouldn't consider Kratos as a mascot until at least God of War (2018). And Crash and Spyro had expanded to other consoles. 

So, who would you say was the Sony mascot for 2001-2018?"
Hoosteen_juju003,Edgy Reddit shit
