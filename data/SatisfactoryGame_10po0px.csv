KittenbabyIN,"Way to call me out. <.< 

Although mine was a giant early steel plant and forgot to see how much power it needed. Turns out if your pretty new factory needs \~1700 MW and you only have 1200 total production (that you're also using a good chunk of) it won't run. So I go and set up some more coal power to bring me up to 3600 MW. Didn't have enough stuff on me to jump start it. So I go all the way back to my starting factory where I had 14 empty Biomass Burners on a shelf. And then I added 46 more so it's now a shelf with 60 Burners on it and used that to jump start the entire grid."
ajdeemo,"Personally I'm a big fan of making some byproducts into fuel, then burning that for some power savings. Although nothing can really replace a big fuel power plant."

I jest, while my factory only clips 2000MW... But I'm still getting to phase 4, and that's just in the desert... And I'm usually very baked while building, so I stop to smell the flowers from time to time ðŸ˜Œ"
Magos_Galactose,I constantly joke to my friends that you need oil power to start oil power.
Background-Fox-8742,I'm sitting at 5000 megawatts currently. Using only 2.3k of it. I plan on making rudimentary setups till I get fuel power. Then I'll plan on building a huge oil rig
SirJelly,"Just jumpstart it with energy storage. You're using oil, so you certainly have the ability to create new power on site with fuel generators if you can jump start fuel refining.


One fully charged battery (100MWh) can supply 2000mw for 3 minutes.

You can charge them on coal power."
MargathaPai,"Wait, you guys plan out your power supply situation before you start building? (Blown fuse noise) don't worry about it, I have 98 biomass burners on standby to start it up again."
GuruTenzin,"This is why I love discovering and using little ""modules"" that work together and stack. 

For example one i stole from Nilaus is

2 HOR refineries (Underclocked to75% each)

2 Diluted Packaged Fuel refineries

4 packagers (2 packing water, 2 unpacking diluted fuel)

Consumes 45 oil, 120 water, 140mw. 
Produces 120 fuel/min -> 1500mw (10 generators)

Build a few until you get sick of it and wanna do something else and reap the benefits immediately."
Foamie,Building my nuclear plant I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to actually turn it on due to power consumption.  It takes like 40000 MW of stuff just to generate the fuel.
czarchastic,"Just make a fuel tower by elevating two large fluid buffers above your generators, use a pump as the towerâ€™s intake, and a valve to block for the outflow. Fill it up using minimal power needs, then you can open the valve to fully saturate your generators.  
  
Make sure to close the valve whenever itâ€™s stable, though. Having a full fuel tower when getting a cascading power failure has bailed me out nearly a dozen times by now."
phoenix1984,"Am I the only one that wires up every geothermal as soon as itâ€™s available? If you get multiple, it will smooth over the dips in supply and itâ€™s soooo much power."
Capnris,"Hey, at least you realized this problem *before* you built the entire refinery set-up and blacked out the entire factory."

Dutchtdk,Everything properly recycled and balanced yet you produce so much that you'll sink it anyway
The_Clarence,"My power evolution. 

1.	Biomass
2.	coal
3.	fuel
4.	turbo fuel
5.	nuclear
6.	refined nuclear
7.	turbo fuel


I always do this. I always get burned going nuclear at first like OP. One of these days Iâ€™m just expand on 4 and make sure I have the right recipes."
vlsdo,"Why not just make fuel and pipe the byproducts in the sink? Then you can use the tickets for whatever, including buying supplies when you need them. I haven't crafted much of anything by hand since I set up my oil plant and started rolling in tickets."
sciguyCO,"I had a similar potential problem while laying down my blended turbofuel facility.  So this may not apply to you if your oil factory isn't creating any fuel to burn.  My solution was a staged startup:

1. Set 3/4 of the production machines to standby.  That kept me within my existing power production.
2. Plug in the remaining refineries / blenders.  The turbofuel output line then was split between:
   1. My ""phase 1"" bank of fuel generators.  
   2. Industrial storage tanks.  This had a priority junction so they only get filled once the phase 1 generators are saturated with turbofuel.
   3. A pipe to primary bank of generators, but with a closed valve (to reduce chance of stuttering).
3. Once that first bank of generators came online, they made enough power to activate the rest of the fuel production.
4. Let it run enough to build up backup reserve in the tanks.  Then open the valve out to the primary generator array.

That also caused me to decide ""why not do a control room for the facility"".  I setup an ""emergency reboot"" procedure laid out in signs.  Some power switches and valves let me disconnect from the main world grid, close off fuel going to primary bank, open valve to send fuel reserves to phase 1, use that bank's power to restart fuel production, then bring primary bank of generators back online and reconnect to main grid."
RollForThings,Make a power storage array first. It'll fill with power while you make the fuel plant and tide you over until your fuel gens are up and running.
Wallbreaker93,ProTip: Spend 3 Hours planning and 24 Hours building a Fuel Powerplant that outputs 60gigs just to realize it only does 30 because fuck you
Invertdoctopus,Well that's just a happy excuse to build another power plant :D
Pyrarius,"Imagine Satisfactory with ONI power. You build your nuclear power plant, but then some wire leading to your M.A.M. starts frying and you need to book it lol"
Terrorscream,build modular and sink excess until full build
