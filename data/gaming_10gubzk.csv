sharondasheep,‚Äúkeep it secret okay‚Äù *proceeds to post it on the town bulletin board*
Pelzklops,"""Makes Haley happy""
Yes I figured"
knightfenris,She asks for a sea cucumber sometimes and I‚Äôm like GIRL PLS
david-deeeds,"I know exactly, she's making a ratatouille"
FilthyPuns,Still not as bad as Lewis rawdogging Marnie with a liter of truffle oil for lube.
ghandi3737,"Damn, Haley's going for girth."
MickeyTM,Typical Haley!
bryansodred,I guess asking for a banana would be too obvious.
Flesh_Tuxedo,"I mean, who doesn't enjoy a delicious eggplant parmesan??"
Local_Buggo,"""Keep it a secret, okay?""
 *posts on a public bulletin board*"
Spartan_Cat_126,"I played Stardew for a spin, but I can‚Äôt tell if this is a legit one in game or just meme."
soda-jerk,"Eggplants outside of the US are a little... [different](https://www.purveyd.com/blogs/purveyd-blog/five-eggplant-varieties-and-best-ways-to-use-them). With the Chinese variety being the obvious winner, here.

Edit: Everybody talking about girth has obviously never held a Chinese eggplant in their hands.

Please, go to your nearest Asian market and fondle the eggplants. They thic af."
daluxe,"Nuns are ordering a carrot delivery. One asks ""long and thin please"", another requests ""I need short and thick thank you"", and the third one says ""just for salad for me""

Edit: that's a silly joke from my childhood guys stop analyzing it"
Plump_Dumpster,Eggplant!? No wonder she brushed me off
Mortotem,If masturbating is edgy then I'm sharp as fuck
Arcane_Engine,Hey that's my wife you're talking about
xxchrisxx81,üçÜ
LOCKJAWVENOM,"At this point, do people just fucking use the word ""edgy"" to refer to anything that isn't strictly for kids?"
BigVanderpants,You mean Edging?
BearZerkByte,"I hate when women try to make Moussaka, it's a man's dish! Damn you Haley!"
vaszoly,"I wouldn't call it edgy tbh, that's an entirely different concept."
cld1984,‚Ä¶she‚Äôs making eggplant parmesan‚Ä¶what‚Äôs the big deal?
BlunterCarcass5,"The items are randomly picked, but the dev probably knew that the quest description would result in some funny screenshots like this"
GhostMug,Can a girl not like some eggplant parmesan without you pervs getting up in her business??
Haruspect,This is edgy?
Uberhypnotoad,"Last week it was a carrot. Next week is one of those state fair biggest pumpkins.

Haley is a freak."
Daloowee,Only the 819173858th fucking time something like this has been posted
camelzigzag,The last time this was posted it was brought up that this wasn't sexual just how the repeatable quests randomly picked an item.
churrmander,"I mean, I'm a guy, Haley, and I know you're just making Eggplant Parmesan.

Can I still help?"
thisismyusername51,"It‚Äôs for her famous eggplant parmigiana, you perv. üòÇ"
HalcyonDreams36,"She has the same.text when asking for a super cucumber.
ü§£"
PolishGuacamole,Country girls make due
wrx_2016,"Cooking! It‚Äôs for cooking. Jeez. Get your mind out of the gutter. 

And after cooking she can go use her hand-held massager‚Ä¶"
589ca35e1590b,It's obviously for eggplant parmesan
phezhead,OMG! Eggplant Parm makes me very happy too!
Guardian11011011,Is this an actual quest?
BwGT,I mean it is slightly implied that Caroline cheated on Pierre when they were younger and Abigail is actually the wizard's daughter
VioletRoyalty,"she lives in a small town with barely 20 people, it's not like she has much choices"
WrathOfWood,posting this gets dumber every time
FreshlyShavenMaven,Once was asked for a wide mouth bass üëÄ
tehweave,"So, if people would like context:

In Stardew Valley, certain objectives will show up where someone says ""I'm looking for [ITEM] does someone have it?""

There are multiple responses for each, and they change by the season. So Haley's request usually goes like this:

""FOR GIRLS ONLY: psst... I need [ITEM]... you know what it's for. Keep it secret, okay?"" - Haley

So sometimes it's a gem, sometimes it's flowers... Often it's a vegetable of some kind you can grow on your farm.

So yes, sometimes it seems a bit dirty."
trustmeep,Hard core parm...
abhig535,I honestly like these little things that remind me that Stardew Valley isn't all kiddy or wholesome like Animal Ctossing.
TexasPistolMassacre,"Secretly, the town is full of perverts... atleast Marnie, Lewis and Haley..  doesn anyone have additions?"
streetfightergod,There's no way this is actually real in the game
JustASpaceDuck,TIL there are gender-specific job quests in Stardew Valley. My 500 hours are meaningless.
Pokluck,Country girls make do.
Im_not_an_object,Eggplants are too fucking big y'all. Have any of you ever seen one?
Twigling,The item in Haley's request is randomly generated.
le75,She has this same quest with an octopus sometimes. Dear God‚Ä¶
,[deleted]
MugOfDogPiss,"Random quest objectives can sometimes be like that. An item discovery help wanted randomly rolled from a villager that happened to be female, and it happened to roll *eggplant* for the item requested. It could have just as easily rolled *corn* or *mayonnaise* and it would still be funny. Given that there are four types of mayo in this game for some reason, an NPC randomly having an urgent need for mayo is probably the most common rude sounding objective."
Slevin424,It should have said Makes Haley *very* happy.
logiclol,"‚ÄúEdgy‚Äù

Lol that‚Äôs not what this means."
HomerSimping,When you know you know.
Bookibaloush,"If thats edgy for you,i doubt you're ready for society"
heilspawn,Making eggplant parmesan[.](https://youtu.be/VJJACRQ7bu8)
one-o-one,Is this even considered edgy?
93tabitha93,Makes her happy but never satisfied
RCRDC,"Hey, less fishy than the sea cucumber"
ibusterp,"At least it's only the first time ""I've"" seen this reposted"
bbressman2,"You were supposed to keep this a secret, not post it to Reddit for everyone to see."
Vixen15,Are we not tired of this being reposted yet?
b3ar17,Babaganoush?
