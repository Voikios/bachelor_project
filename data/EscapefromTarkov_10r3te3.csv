PureNaturalLagger,"Funny as shit, but a terrible bug. It better not get too common, but I've already seen a couple posts. Ngl I can't fathom how in an FPS you could end up failing to render in a whole ass player character"
TP_Gillz,I may actually get a kill in this game if I get lucky enough to be a ghost!
ItzYaBoiQuez,Favorite part “WAIT FOR ME YOU BITCH” *in ghostly tone*

David_The_Atheist,"10/10 would play a ghost mode. Follow people around tarkov and just fuck with them. 

Break windows, open doors. Completely invisible and unable to hurt anyone, just pure tomfoolery."
Ritter18,"Damn... ghost guy made a damn good ghost, and I like the streamer guy as well. Good laugh."
Erilson,Ghosty noooooooooo!

Kedor,Hah! Thats actually great clip. Thanks for sharing!
Son_of_Plato,"I just died to an invisible player while on Interchange - i'm sure he was pleasantly surprised to realize that i didn't have a fucking clue he existed as i ran around trying to escape the silent bullets. Of course it was the one raid where i bring my best level 5 rig , best helmet and fully kitted ak 74n with bs ammo in the mags."
SaltedSlugxx,happened to me and my bro on a scav run. he could see me i couldn’t see him. i told him to shoot me to see if it registered. he decided to dome me with a mosin instead of a foot or arm shot lmao

Skytram,It's hilarious but also this game is such dog shit lol
Vjekov88,What if they are playing around with spectator mode and this bug is just a byproduct of that?

This video is deep."
TuroSaave,"This bug has the potential to inspire some game modes or even whole a genre or subgenre. You're a ghost hunter, special forces soldier or PMC that partners with good ghosts."
Miserable-Reward-310,im dead
Vacation-Cool,"Bro I had the same thing during a scav raid, I could hurt and in other ways interact with my buddy but for whatever reason he couldn’t see hear or interact with me."

DarthWeenus,This is like the 4th video I've seen today of cheaters going after other cheaters and being chill af. I guess thats the solution I guess if BSG doesnt wanna step in. We need an army of anticheater cheater.
