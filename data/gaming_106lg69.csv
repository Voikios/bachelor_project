ForgotPreviousPW,I refuse to accept it looked like this.
keller3030,I work with this guy. His names is Bort
XZombie_Hero,That realism is uncanny! His shadow under his eyes is a reflection on how long he has been standing guard
paulopieces,I like Lara Croft's triangle boobs
Monotonegent,Most people my age usually mean 8/16 bit games. This time was a real awkward adolescence for games
GipsyRonin,"The old school graphics? I consider sprites as old school graphics. This image is the byproduct of early 3D games which of course look horrid today. The cartoon based ones hold up better. Mario64 and Banjo Kazooie as an example.

Zelda: Link to the Past, Chrono Trigger, Mario games, etc are the OGs

This is just my take on it of course"
veng92,...did I stutter?
SpacecraftX,They do have a charm to be fair.
quartzlcc,"When most people say they like old school graphics they mean Vectorman, Metal Slug, Street Fighter Alpha, and other 2D 16- and 32-bit games — *not* the early 3D titles lol!"
SubtractionAddiction,"We're on the cusp for early 3D graphics having the same kind of nostalgia-fueled comeback that sprite/pixel art did in indie games a decade ago. Just look at the success of things like Signalis and the Bloodborne PSX de-make. I don't think we're gonna get much AAA studio recognition in the immediate future, but definitely in the indie scene. If you think this kind of graphical style doesn't have appeal then you aren't paying attention."
neilio83,Goldeneye!
TBTabby,CRT monitors helped.
airforcevet1987,Yea we also had like 10inch tvs with rotary knobs. It all worked together pretty well
Practical-Ad-2387,"I love the texture wrap faces of goldeneye and Max Payne

Conkers (and banjo) with it's big eyes slapped to mundane things I'd also really charming"
DarkNinjaPenguin,"N64 Russian Soldier isn't real, he can't hurt you

N64 Russian Soldier:"
drums_addict,Realism isn't always better. I mean that dude looks pretty scary. What is usually better is the modern rigging of the models and movement mechanics though.
taavidude,I don't think people mean the early 3D games anyway when it comes to graphics. I think they mean graphics like Heroes of Might and Magic 3 for example which looks incredible to this very day.
RealConcorrd,"Don’t you start disrespecting the hottest man to ever hit the screens.

>! PS1 Hagrid !<"
Redfeather1975,I like my graphics lightweight and stylish. Thanks for reminding me that I shouldn't refer to it as old style graphics. Lightweight and stylish!
HandspeedJones,I feel like this only applies to 2D games where the old school is more loved.
SkeletonLad,"When I say I prefer old style graphics, I mean 2D sprited art."
Cultist902,If they ever remake the Goldeneye movie then there should be a gag where one of the Russian troops actually looks like that
Led_Halen,Yeah but you didn't have to pay an additional $17 for the season pass and the Bonus Exclusive Sean Connery skin.

DontLook_Weirdo,"Tube TV's are an essential part of the retro look. Retro graphics do tend to look better, but on older TV's. They do look like crap that makes us question our nostalgia on newer TV's."
FED_YT,Goldeneye=goat
eternallnewbie,"Graphics were getting better and were really nice around super nintendo/ Genesis days.  BUT when they took the steps to 3d graphics, there were some steps backwards.  But it led us here so it's all good."
HP844182,You can really taste the polygon
LordPollax,That looks awesome!  I mean I almost mistook that as Nicolas Cage from his last movie.  So life like.    : )
I_GottaPoop,This is the PEAK of character design and it's all been downhill since
HaikuBotStalksMe,They mean sprite art.
Mortynx,That's exactly why I like them better
richie9635,007 Nintendo 64
w1YY,They're ally have nailed the current Russian soldier in this picture
wittyuzername,That face is truly haunting
obsquire,What mother wouldn't love that face?
1inchDestroyer_,"Flawless, such beauty."
Youarethecarbon,Least you knew it’d be a finished game at the time of release. Can’t say that bout most games nowadays
Admiralbenbow123,"I think the biggest advantage that older graphics have over what we have currently is the fact that back then the devs were limited by the hardware (PCs and consoles couldn't render many polygons, cartridges didn't have much space etc.), so they had to compensate for that by giving each game a unique art style, whereas now everyone except indie devs just seems to go for the most realistic visuals."
EconomyHumor8183,"Source engine games feel way smoother to play than any triple a title from the last 5 years. 

Game movement has gone so far downhill."
happy-cig,Not the 3d graphics of course. The pixel art.
FX29,8 bit and 16 bit 2D sprites are timeless. The N64/PS1/Saturn era just looks plain ugly nowadays lol
justafishservant8,When I first played Goldeneye 007 on N64 this is what it looked like 😂
Sermanmerman,Funny part though is that the games back then were better than today
Gravewaker,Halo Combat Evolved’s original graphics and lighting are superior to the remastered version.
SN4K3H34D5014,I liked the classic battlefront 2 graphics.
Pizzaman725,"I don't prefer them, but I have zero issues with the graphics and can still enjoy the games. 

However the limiting controls compared to newer games is sometimes frustrating."
Ok-Ambition-9432,Some games aged better than others.
BronzeTitan--,"I like the early call of Duty/ Medal of Honor-type graphics or CSS in that ballpark. It looked like playing a video game, now all these games the graphics are so good but it doesn't look like ur playing video games. Shitty graphics is an artform itself."
dontspookthenetch,They have a certain charm
lordofmetroids,"To be fair, Banjo Kazooie, Paper Mario and several other N64 games still hold up."
Goldstar93,Looks like real russian soldier
janesearljones,Couldn’t even put it in DK mode?
SuvrivormanVR,Sometimes it's about the game play more then the graphics.
deathbunnyy,Most of the time people mean sprites. Everyone agrees early 3D aged poorly in terms of graphics especially.
Magical-Manboob,"Well yah. Older graphics had more character because you could see the effort they put into trying to make it either look as realistic as they could or believable. 

Newer graphics are just so effortless to make these days that it doesn't feel painstakingly crafted. Im sure there are plenty of current games with loads of effort but its just hard to tell how much these days.

Also old school stuff is alot easier on the eyes. Good graphics today especially with bad or weird lighting is just sensory overload."
FrIoSrHy,Old 2d has aged much better
,This is such a misleading post. Games NEVER looked like this. N46/PS1 games were meant to be seen on CRT TVs with usually a composite cable and played in 480i or around that resolution. These graphics look really when you play them CORRECTLY. Not on a terrible emulator on a 16:9 1080p screen.
Seeders,"Do you not know how satisfying it was to shoot these ugly fucks?  [They reacted to where you shot them in hilarious ways](https://youtu.be/7Ffiy6S6Kh0?t=52), it was glorious.

This screenshot is cherry picked from an awkward angle.  If you actually play this game, it all works and looks great."
elementfortyseven,"Ah yes, GoldenEye64

the good old times when games cost 75USD and had no way of patching bugs."
ST4RVY,Is that Oliver Tree?
afallan,"The facility was a great level.  I remember playing the level, then rewatching Goldeneye and noticed the layout was identical.  Coming into the bathroom, out the stall, and down the stairs."
s0ciety_a5under,"There are some games that will never age well due to the ""realism"" look. Yeah that was the best money could buy then, but by today's standards that is a child's work. Certain art styles were ingeniously simple and amazing."
AmericanLich,"Disingenuous to use one of the ugliest games from that era on the console with the shittiest graphics. 

Pull something like Vagrant Story, then talk to me."
fourleggedostrich,"We mean 8-bit pixelated sprites, not PS1.

Never PS1."
Past_Judge641,See we may have these super high-def graphics that you can see the sweat rolling off somebody's face but it doesn't mean the content of the game is going to be very good. This game just happens to be in my opinion the second greatest game ever created for N64 and it's GoldenEye 007. Only being surpassed by its successor Perfect Dark.
nitrohigito,"I really like crude 3D, though I do prefer it at least perspective-correctly texture mapped. Everything is easy to see and navigate. Games like NFS Underground 2 I think are still gorgeous today."
extralyfe,friendly reminder that this game was made by a team of people with no game dev experience aside from the project lead.
JmTrad,Early 3D graphics ages really bad. Some NES games made 20 years before N64/PS1 looks more beautiful.
UndeadTigerAU,To be fair kind of a bad example lmao
Destinlegends,Crazy to me now that this is considered retro.
Frency2,"I mean, there are people who like Minecraft."
HellHound1986,"graphics aint everything, I played golden eye for years, beat it multiple times. Games now a days I beat once and never pick up again"
HiImTheNewGuyGuy,"Graphics from 1988-1994 were better than 1994-2000.

The early 3d Era sucks and I have no nostalgia for the N64 or PSX"
UNLOGICLESS,The graphics look like how my dreams looked when I was young
ThePsychedSunshine,"Old school games had to make up for poor graphics with aesthetic and personality with their animation, voice acting, and game mechanics. It's much easier for games now to just try and be realistic in look and feel, which means they have almost no personality. And games with their own art style are pretty much soulless and gross to look at, like most battle royale and team based shooters"
SkelliFun,How it feels working the graveyard shift.
HonourableFox,"Because these graphics are all my computer can run, its grown on me, i wasn't alive at early 3d stages i grew up using a 3ds, xbox one, and psp.

i also find it fascinating how developers and console manufacturers had to make creative work arounds for the limitations of early stage consoles."
TheHighKing112,"I don't care what anyone says, the 6th generation had my favorite graphics even if I wasn't around for the 6th generation"
ShinAlastor,"This picture is good for a meme but pretty different compared to how good old graphics looked like on the crt.
Play once again Metal Gear Solid or Ridge Racer Type 4 on your crt and tell me if the graphics is bad."
Remus090,Yes. Especially PS1 Hagrid
Plus_Will3125,My earliest gaming memory is getting trashed on Goldeneye by my older brothers. I'd give anything to be back there for just another afternoon. You never know the importance of a moment until it becomes a memory. :)
Muggle_Scum,"Apparently that very character was a bit of an inside joke at Rare during the game's development.

Early 3D on consoles was a hell of a time to be a young gamer though. Naturally even lots of the more polished games of that era are a little rough around the edges visually, but that also lent to a singular (and imo rather charming) aesthetic style."
IceFire2050,Stylized Graphics look fine today still. Graphics trying to look photo-real age like milk.
Slash_Raptor92,Looks like he's gritting his teeth while holding in a fart.
jgamez76,"Okay I'll give you that early 3D graphics were absolutely nightmare fuel with 2023 eyes, but 16-bit pixel art? That shit looks better than PS3/360 stuff, IMO."
Danemoth,This is how I feel about everquest and it's g graphics update. I prefer the old 1998 models over the 2001 luckin models even if they look a bit like the guy in the op
Soviet_Beer,"Yah no, people who say that mean sprites versus 3D models haha"
StephyCroft,nostalgia can really make u remember things wayyy differently
Kriss3d,"""you picked the wrong house Foo!"""
LonelyOtaku78,"It doesn't matter what it looks like, only what you saw while playing"
qqtan36,"Who says this, actually?"
Geno__Breaker,*pixel art has entered the chat*
Big_moist_231,"That’s why we played on old 6 inch by 6 inch tvs, where everything looked like you needed glasses lol those were the good old days"
SeamAnne,exactly. thats why
HardBoiledPizza,Uncle fester lookin mad different from why I remember
ZazaB00,"When people start talking about how good raytracing is, I remember that this is how polygons started.  Raytracing has a long way to go before it’s actually good."
DmReku,Idc as long i have fun playing the game
Mr_Guy_Person,"I’ll play what I want on my $3000 gaming rig!!

If that’s Undertake…then so be it!!!"
NormalGuy103,"This reminds me of the time me, my fiancé, her sister, and their cousin were playing a free-for-all. The sister who had the last experience with videogames by a mile somehow got her hands on the Golden Gun and massacred us."
Brutal2003,The willful suspension of disbelief.
El_Cockroach,Theres a charm to it though no?
yousorusso,At least it has FEELING
Robotlolz,Heh no one’s talking about the awkward teenage years of 3D when they say that.
GentlmanSkeleton,Im sorry. Did they stutter??
Gregory_E_Frazier,Pong is still a good game.
Zen_Master_SVK,"Early 3d games were dark ages in computer graphics history. They all look more-or-less cursed.

We went from beautiful detailed pixel art to <this> and then slowly crawled towards today.

3d graphics started to look decent around time of Half-Life 2."
DoggievDoggy,Some SNES games still look great.
Classic_Roc,To be fair the old school animations were ahead of their time on the n64 lololol
MercuryMorrison1971,"I remember playing this as a kid when I first got my N64 and thinking to myself how unbelievably realistic it looked that the in game characters looked. Of I was coming from games like Doom and Duke Nukem, both of which have arguably aged better. Some of this early true 3D stuff didn’t age nicely, but I’ll always have a soft spot for it."
MASEtheACE510,I can’t believe the Facility wasn’t secure with this guy watching it!
halflife_3,Perfect!
JimBob-Joe,"Definitely not better looking, but its nice to revisit retro games and enjoy a different eras approach to a game"
Emerald_Iguana,Only do I like old graphics in specific games like oot
CestPasTitou,Half Life is a better example
fin_ss,"I played the portal games again when I built my pc, it was wild playing that game at 1440p"
Zerotan,What an oddly high resolution image. 240p or gtfo
Eyronius,his name is Bort and he is a gam0r
fancycurtainsidsay,"15yrs from now, blocky polys from ps1 / n64 era will be considered cool and retro."
RetroBastardo,Wolfenstein 3D looks better than this
DemonicGenetics,I miss goldeneye ! Awesome game !
sebas6789,graphics might be ugly but atleast game had fun gameplay
throwaway387190,"My computer has a RTX 3080, and I use it to play Morrowind a lot. Without updated graphics. So I'm using the best graphics card to play a 2001 game with 2001 graphics

My roommate is pissed"
RustyRuss_,IT’S CHARMING OKAY
MrGeek89,007 goldeneye n64
ScottyJ6996,ThE cHaRm ThOoOoO.
chippy-triforce,Good gameplay>new graphics
Smoove-Zone,For those too young to actually know/remember we thought these graphics looked like shit back then too but we used our imagination 😂
Lefthandedscientist,Loved the AI in Goldeneye.
Samcni,Adds character.
BootyPatrol1980,"Me in 1998: ""so realistic!"""
Garchi34,"wtf, oliver tree ..."
MartiniPolice21,"I've seen lots of ""nostalgia"" graphics for PS1 era style graphics, and I'm fucking baffled. Pixel art made a resurgence because it can look pretty, that era way impressive at the time but just looks fucking awful now."
MikeDubbz,"There is a strong nostalgia for me for the N64/PS1 era of graphics, yes, they look bad. But they also are so charming in what they were able to accomplish with such weak hardware."
atjones111,Banjo kazooie and Mario 64 no one is claiming golden eye has good graphics
yumri,Could have taken a better image. It also looks over filtered and modified some how as the detail is to high to be from the N64 and before games unless you modify it in an emulator
LemonsXBombs,"Yeah, I like that better."
MastodonFanMan,Is this goldeneye?
lugaidster,2d aged much better than 3d.
Nikaito,"Wait, what's considered old school by now? The 90s? The early or late 2000s?"
RLD-Kemy,"careful now... do I have to remind you that Doom 3 was released 19 years ago?

And Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is  18 years old this year?

That's right, now PS2 games are becoming retro too!"
Arvandor,"I like 16 bit graphics quite a lot, actually. Early 3D was definitely rough though."
tteuhcsJ,Looks fine to me
ImNotEazy,Laughs in r/2007scape
justsomeguy682,Bruh they gave the Spider-Man boat people their own game?
maxis2k,"Not a good comparison.  Try something like comparing Dragon Quest VIII (2004) to Dragon Quest XI (2017).  Dragon Quest XI is in a much stronger engine and still looks good.  But I prefer Dragon Quest VIII's art design better.  Or compare the original Final Fantasy VII to its remake.  You can push all the polygons you want.  But I still don't like the quazi realistic style of the remake.

And of course, 2D holds up even better.  Games like Kirby's Adventure, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, Suikoden II, Metal Slug and SotN all look great to this day.  Even better than a lot of 3D games."
LordNVader,But back then we was all like “ holy hell look at those graphics… shit looks real af “ lol
Purple-Cow1607,"Back then, it was consider to be good graphics."
stormtroopr1977,"my dude, the year 2003 was 20 years ago and is ""old graphics"". That's the same year as KOTOR came out"
keeeve,Average UK person
O_vJust,Fucking with the scientists was so fun
McRandomRooster,Best level ever.
stupid-American33,The SNES is the only old graphics I like personally
emansamples92,"There are some instances where the older graphics can legit be better than new though. ff6 is a good example, I think that remaster they did looks eh."
ShlomoShogun,Huh? I cut my teeth on that game…who da fux says that?
Upbeat_Ad5840,Perfection

Enshakushanna,"if ""yuo see comrade"" had a face"
Skysr70,Old 3-d graphics are trash. Old 2-d graphics peaked in 16-bit.
I-Love-Bewbs,"“Hey gwuys, you wanna do some gwarding?”"
PappaDukes,"Lol, polygons is retro. Man, I am old."
Field_Marshall17,I like 7th Gen and newer (360/ps3 and newer)
Kalenshadow,"Cause that polymer shape has more hardwork put into it than most of the ""remasters"" out there, which are basically just applying an iron to the models."
nightowl666matt,Thought the graphics were sick back then.  Imagine another 20 years time when we look back at games like halo infinite and laugh.
ISEEIAMACAT,Puberty era of games
fabreazebrother_1,I'm primarily collecting ps1 games. I still appreciate seeing where 3D gaming started. These older games just had so much life in them because the developers had to work with what they had and all the udea were new and original
meezethadabber,NES and SNES graphics held up better then a lot of 3d generation graphics. Go play link to the past or super mario world. They look amazing still
Hamsi_17,To be honest Half Life has pretty nice graphics still. I dont have any problems playing it.
Buttahdog,"Maybe I’m just old but it seems like the worst graphics a game had in the ps1 era the better the story had to be now it’s the opposite, looks great the story is a 6th grade power fantasy"
therockethornet,"Honestly, in general I would scale down graphics technology to make 120fps the new 60fps. Like DEAD LOCKED at 120 with no drops at all. Clean resolution and a nice art style to compensate a bit.

Clean, smooth graphics (think cs 1.6 at like 8K) always trump graphics that look great but hamper gameplay. Competitively speaking, anyway."
ShoerguinneLappel,"I get the meme, but I never played Golden eye at all in my life. You're talking to someone who has played a lot of FPS games and still plays them ofc. 

hadn't played Turok or Perfect Dark either."
elijahproto,is this not just a Puppet Combo game?
cool_slowbro,These aren't the retro graphics most people are talking about.
Bussaca,"I believe the phrase is, do more with less. Made them have to make the story and writing make up for the gfx..

Meanwhile its raytrace this, and god rays that.. and a paper thin plot, bs writing/dialog and ankle deep gameplay. But hey 100 different hats.

But hey call if duty 82 is out and god of poor 24 is in pree order..10min of gameplay with a co op zombie mode.. sign me up..

I still play 007 on  my n64."
BeatsByMemo,😩😩😩😂😂😂
crowdsourced,"I’m waiting for Halo: CE Anniversary Anniversary because right now, I only play the OG graphics."
OneSimplyIs,Isn’t retro usually referring to games like old sonic and SMB? Pixelated and such when it comes to gaming
ajerxs,"I know this looks awkward, but I do have some level of fondness for games that look like this. The Chilla’s Art games are a good example of recent games with this ps1 style look, and I think they’re awesome."
PatientGuitar2362,Surprisingly better than some today.
SicksProductions,"Max Payne face, never forget"
woopwoopscuttle,Texture wise what’s interesting in Goldeneye was that each polygon was only allowed one colour- so what you’re seeing is a single colour via gourdad shading (I think) and the textures were greyscale “details” added on top.
KainAbdala,You used more imagination even if you didn’t noticed
towereater,It's the man from Ratatouille!
MemeLordsUnited,"Look at that handsome boy

Lockedup4years,"I literally played goldeneye yesterday, holds right up!"
Waistland,That’s just how real life looked in the 90’s
MCav828,"The year is 1997, no one realizes it at the time, but the most influential and indelible video game of all time has been released. It's about a movie. One that came out in 1995. Its title? GoldenEye...GoldenEye 007...."
Kool_iguana,Golden eye still is a good looking n64 game
jamieee1995,"Easier to see. Modern games, everyone blends in"
SonicusZ,This is way to clear. Can I see this on a CRT?
TheHappyPittie,r/2007scape would like a word
BigboobCarol,Is that GRU from minions??
hoslappah13,"Lmao, we mean games like Ristar though!"
fukensteller,"I think retro 2d has aged much better than early stage 3d. I think snes/gen graphics seem better to me than alot of n64 or ps1 stuff. I don't it's my bias, I feel retro indie titles prefer this style than doing a low poly 3d game."
Doctor_Eternal_65,My eyes....no....my memories.... destroyed 😭
Shigjetar,Perfection
