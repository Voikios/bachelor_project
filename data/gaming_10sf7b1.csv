TriKefka,The Last of Ass
Just_an_Empath,"Hours spent on the environment: 1.5

Hours spent on dat ass: 15"
NavyDragons,All caked up on a Thursday?!
SuperSaiyanBen,‚Ä¶.oh I‚Äôm sorry did you ass me something?
tilcica,"""yet to be released"" good joke lmao"
maretex,"Lmao haven't seen such a blatant scam in a while. After the disaster with the ""name already taken"" fiasco, they came up with a rounded ass just to please their audience."
Bleklteg,P L U M P
Immediate_Reality357,"Now go back and look at the first gameplay trailer that looked like the division on crack, and come back to this video lol

This game is a fucking joke, it's a solid 5/10 looking game, it will have 10% of the content they said will be in the game, the other 90% will never come to happen 

Like the mud physics......that's definitely not going to show up in game"
Thin-Performance-637,The devs are smart.. they know humans are simple creatures and can get satistfied with a big oll ass
bopman14,"Ass aside, this game definitely doesn't exist. If any game is actually released then it won't be anything like this gameplay."
McSchlub,"Still don't believe this game exists in any meaningful state. it was due to release in a month so...why not release some footage? Some clips of a big set piece, some dialogue or story/character stuff with some VA etc? 

This is a joke and it's both sad and slightly entertaining to see people still thinking it's gonna be the next big thing."
kingzsalmon,"Storyline : 30 mins 

Booty observation : 78hrs"
glassgwaith,Œô haven‚Äôt stared this much since Miranda
RCmies,I think that womans pants have been on so long they have started to integrate into her legs
Lord-Chickie,"Ah my classic skintight rubber leggins, always a good call in the apocalypse"
akennelley,The Walking Cake
ArciusRhetus,"When I saw the first gameplay trailer, I already thought it looks like a mediocre game. I'm not sure where the hype comes from."
vyhravambarvami,All I see is ass
MRToddMartin,Straight dump truck on that bot. One of the missions is go to the gym before 6am and do CrossFit for 3 hours. Then come home and hop on a teams call and tell everyone that you did 3 hrs of CrossFit before they were awake and downplay how easy it is for you and that you should try it someday. And then open a craft beer.
skinnywit,Gameplay trailer? Are we seeing the same thing?
JorgTheChildBeater,Her arse looks good though GOTY
ThePomqueteer,Gameplay looks like ass
Metall3x,"It's like someone said ""Let's make a shitty Division clone but put some rubbish zombies in it"""
GenericVanillaChar,Know we know where 98% of the money went to
SuperToxin,Fake gameplay trailer for a fake game. I‚Äôm not convinced it will ever release.
Hefty_Cat_3750,"Looks like they used Fortnite character models and animations. 

Makes sense they went onto UE5.

Garbage looking game."
Delde116,Its the latest walking simulator :O
EngineerFront,People will buy this for the ass
dawg_will_hunt,Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal
_MaZ_,Why is this even the most wishlisted game on Steam?
Biscuits4u2,Y'all some thirsty folks
ISAV_WaffleMasta,There's no way she'll last long with them cheeks clapping
MysteriousDillPickle,(  Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
blastcat4,Gotta wear tactical yoga pants for the zombie apocalypse.
Necrovarius,"Wow, another Zombie Game. Eh."
Schaeferyn,"One hell of an ""Unreal Engine Third-Person Shooter Tutorial"" kinda game."
_formosa_,"Damn double cheeked up on Thursday afternoon, the sun is still out"
Old_Valyrian00,Yes but look at that booty
toolsofpwnage,Reason why the game is delayed is because the developers focused all their resources on the cake
Kent_Fistybutts,"I assume they are relying on other people to populate the world more so it won‚Äôt be so lifeless (since it‚Äôs an mmo). However I‚Äôm unsure why they couldn‚Äôt get the dev team to fill a server for the gameplay video. 

In the scripted clips it shows rival players roll up in a vehicle at that farm. Maybe their netcode just can‚Äôt handle it and this is the best they could show for right now. Either way that was pretty weak for a gameplay video"
Gizm00,Wait did they pull it from Steam listing? I can't seem to find it anymore?
HipHopDaRobot,The Lass of Us
hamescarlos,üçë
chocolatepuddingbowl,What you expect to see in a post apocalyptic zombie world?
LUXINGJIAN,I think there is something wrong with me. I could not figure out why we wouldn't be seeing much of the world. So I checked the comments and apparently I was not paying attention to the proper part of the clip
JP5_suds,I couldn‚Äôt even finish the video. I was bored watching the mannequin wander around that neighborhood.
Gontha,Dat Ass tho.
BirkMERKS,"I completely agree. Seems very underwhelming. I‚Äôm gonna assume because it‚Äôs still in development and they just wanted to give us a small taste, but regardless of that, I wasn‚Äôt very impressed.

But I guess none of that really matters because I‚Äôm almost convinced this still isn‚Äôt even a real game üòÇ"
Aok_al,They spent all the resources and time on that one mall section
Ltlmike,r/secretlyanasspic
dotcomslashwhatever,awful movies put tits and ass to sell theaters. let's try the same
Potato-Boy1,I was so excited for this game but then i found out that it will probably never be released
killeronepunch,That ass though
maddMargarita,I mean after an zombie apocalypse when everyone is dead and most of the zombies have rotted away what would you expect the world would be like? Its would be boring and lifeless.
Mr_Hashs,"Dat ass do be looking mighty thicc, tho looking respectfully"
mad_jer,"Appears to be plenty of cake in that lifeless zombie world, though."
Srog89,Finally a video game that represents yoga pants.
Darklord_Bravo,The budget went to creating that ass.

DanTheMan_117,but ass is good
Some_Confection_3801,What would have to be in it for it to not be considered lifeless?
Critical_Sort_7530,She caked up on Tuesday in a zombie apocalypse üòÇ

Plenty_Chemistry_608,GYATT DAYUMMMM
lucitribal,Frame rate looks like ass
Schulle2105,See you all in october for the next announcement
Ok-Ad-8367,Can not do another post apocalyptic setting.
NL25N,"I still don't believe we have seen any real, actual ""gameplay"" yet. Everything they put out looks premade."
StupidestGuyNominee,"Would kinda be weird if it was a post apocalyptic zombie game set in a full, vibrant world tho"
Cozi-Sozi,STOP GIVING THEM WEDGIES HOLY SHIT hahaha
ShiraCheshire,"All I can think about is how uncomfortable that poor girl is. Forget food and shelter, that woman is going to be shooting zombies so she can steal their pants."
treifa26092,nice cake though
LizardSaurus001,They'll be seeing something else instead... üòè
Harbor_Barber,well at least ass is nice
Temporary-_-account,"It's either reddit or the video it's self, but all I see is stop motion ass"
VigorouslySoft,"With this kind of title, you are right"
decentmonster,Is that Panam from cyberpunk
Flavihok,I will be seing a lot of that ass in another platforms lmao
playa2daworld,Able to find nice form fitting jeans during a zombie apocalypse is a super power.
DuelTherapy,"Dat booty, tho"
braywarshawsky,"Ah... Yoga Pants during the Apocolypse...

The savior of all mankind..."
Pandanlard,It looks like the kind of visual project we make at schoold using unreal engine 5 and premade assets for almost every things. Don't know if they already asked for money but it's gonna be another preprepre alpha sold for the full price of a game or just a scam that never gonna be released.
eplugplay,The light shining on the booty with Ray Tracing is beautiful.
PhilMacPowerWasTaken,Dying ass
Survival_R,this just looks like normal DayZ gameplay upgraded ngl
apaulsaid,"haven't heard about this game before, but to me it honestly doesn't look much different than any generic zombie game"
AlludedNuance,Those pants are painted on.
Embarrassed-Buddy-81,I love the fact that when I saw the ass I already knew everyone was gonna meme it hahahahahah that's a lotta asss
RealCountryBoy,"Game devs: ""bro we're gonna make so much money from these horny losers""

Gamers: nope"
Upset-Tangerine5770,Will probably buy cus ass.
Chigao_Ted,"I keep forgetting what I want to comment

Something keeps distracting me"
Scrambled_Juice,Dat ass
-Moon-Presence-,One of the most boring gameplay trailer/previews I have ever seen genuinely seemed cool from the first thing they showed but this turned me off almost 100%. If it weren‚Äôt for that ass I‚Äôd have switched off within 2 mins
Jasonpowerz,Yeah this will be more of a moon exploration game than a zombie survival.
bentcastillo,This jogging simulator looks thicc I mean great.
tedyesca,"Like like fort last of nite
Even thought Fortnite had a story mode or something"
Franci93,GOTY
DrAstralis,"""Sure its the end of the world but I'll be damned if I dont do my daily regiment of yoga and squats"""
TacoHaus,"Welp, I can take that off my wishlist now ig lol"
songszzZ_ttv,Great butt design 11/10
NameGamePH,"by looking down at the screen, i would say this game is worth it"
Simply-Taffy,You don't need an immersive world when you have that ass to look at all the way throughout the game.
Prixm,People who are convinced this game is a scam are fucking weird. Tell me what they have to gain from this game not being real? It's not crowd funded. Easily impressionable people are insufferable.
HurterOfFeefeesV2,I'm so starved for games like this but they are either old and bad or just bad I've only found one that feels good to play but it's awful solo and that's the forest
Ramsnes,"""Lifeless"" is a keyword in a zombie apocalypse, though."
Unpopular_Perspectiv,I'm pretty sure all of us looked at that ass as a final hope for this game ü§£
Tri_Dark13,The Day Before dat ass...
currently_pooping_rn,Half the budget went to that ass pixels
Foend,"I thought it looked okay, mundane and boring - yes, but no different to any of the other survival games like dayz and a good base from which to build on."
GrimmSalem,Butt that ass
prOboomer,"That is a terrible game.

Where can i buy it?"
heapsion,Can we get a few more fps please. Just a few
Lil_Pipper,The Day Before I Fell in Love
NurseSmith93,I was going to joke about her being caked up (big booty) but I thought everyone was going to think I was immature. Only to see almost everyone is addressing that ass. üòÖ
Timbalabim,"As someone who‚Äôs played a lot of State of Decay, a post-apocalyptic game *should* provide an experience of desolation. I don‚Äôt want a game throwing zombies at me in an area I cleared five minutes ago or special infected after special infected because [insert gameplay reasons here]."
SirPugStudios,Finally we got a video showing gameplay of the best game in my opinion maybe something my pc won't be able to run
xDOOSO_,i thought this game was fake and made by some super shady developer?
municinvestigator,It's not real Jesus fucking christ
TommyPock,"That's an incredible bottom, to be fair."
JackedUpStump,If you look close enough she‚Äôs holding a gun
BlackRayek,good god
skinnypeen19,I can really stand behind this development team.

brooksjonx,Gat Dang
numbo1,r/UpvoteBecauseButt
Regnier86,Great. Now i want to eat cake
ratcliffeb,"This was the worst ""Official Trailer"" Ive ever seen. Its not even an interesting Gameplay Trailer like the other ones were. They literally picked the most boring part of someones gameplay and made it a trailer. What the actual fuck? And girls asses dont even look that in leggings, you can tell these developers dont spend much time around the other sex."
Xfyre007,The Lust of Ass
mr_apple_pie,Them cheeks clapping will alert tbe horde
hurtadjr193,"Looks cool to me. If its like Days Gone , but in a city environment. I'll get it day 1."
HotPotatoWithCheese,"This game: 50 - 60 dollars

Pornhub: free

Save your coins."
Andrew109S,I have been waiting for a game about a girl with a big ass for a long time.
somacruz,Looks like some single player game because of lightning. But graphics looks interestingly nice.
iSOBigD,"This looks like any of the dozens of open world zombie/survival/building games ready out there, except even less finished."
arzamharris,Looks like development footage for Last of Us 2
mysticalmushrooms,Call of Booty
Tomas_Jari,I will buy it because of the ass.
amaya-aurora,"Ass, 10/10 game"
HeavyDroofin,Everybody in the apocalypse got back
Nlkz-00,These artists have some good ASSistants
thelewdfolderisvazio,Who needs zombies when you got a big butt
Arfguy,"Gotta say...it was pretty cool to see the spotlight character customize the gun. Never understood the appeal of the AK47 (I'm more of an M4 man, in video games), but it was cool.

...but DAT ASS!!!"
TSRogue512,Left 4 Ass
CpandaD,State Of Da Cake
xRetz,They spent all the budget modelling dat ass
Creative-Air-5352,"""I'm trying to sneak around, but I'm dummy thicc, and the clap of my ass keeps alerting the zombies!"""
Knightmare25,"Not defending the game, but what exactly should be added to make it ""full of life""? It's a post apocalyptic zombie game. It's not GTA6. It's supposed to be lifeless."
HeightExtra320,Glad to see yoga pants didn‚Äôt go extinct in the apocalypse
ComfortableShame6466,ayo she got Back 4 DayZ‚Ä¶
Revolutionary_Fig912,That ass. I‚Äôd play it
Muffin-Sprinkles,I could  not play a game with fps like that.
aRareFrosty201,Lets all appreciate the details from top to BOTTOM.
Batmanmotp2019,Man those zombies are gonna be all over that cake
,her ass is phat as fuck goddam
BigMikeyP72,"Dammit people! I don't even know what this game is, but don't you remember? The 'CAKE' IS A LIE! Always remember that. They're luring us in with the promise of this cake we see here but it WON'T be there."
LoganVandalCastle,"Sorry for notice that first, but--  
What a nice and rounded ass, my friends! The world may be devastated, but these bubble butt must keep tight!
Congrats to the dev!"
EntertainerNew7628,"I was gonna make an ass joke, butt... There are too many already."
KaraTheAndroidd,"I really wish there was a game like The Division but with zombies in a City/Country side area,

That would be the most amazing game ever"
psxndc,"Let's be honest: if you're running that much, guy, girl, or NB, your ass is going to look fant-ass-tic."
queen-succubus,That booty though‚Ä¶.. üçë
Visual-Reindeer798,I‚Äôm sorry what‚Ä¶ üç∞
Smellyjelly12,It's like DayZ with upgraded graphics
Gh0st_2144,"Honestly, in an apocalypse the world would be lifeless. It's a worldwide event that kills millions if not billions of people. There would be little to no one around"
JVdrizzle,Please define lifeless? Cause I see a lot.
airforcevet1987,What are those pants even made of?
cpteric,"it looks okay. can't find anything horrible besides the first zombies stand comically still, but in the end some run at them.

graphics are decent, the UI looks bland but usable ( better than bloated and shit imho ), animations are meh, world looks empty and abandoned which might be the intention, and there seems to be a decent amount of lootable shit.

If all it becomes is ""dayZ but without the shit graphics, zombies and interaction"", it's gonna have a niche spot. and already better than ""The war Z""

that said, it looks nothing like their older trailer."
Ourgbones,Left 4 ass 2
ZhuckelDror,This is generic and skippable just judging by the title.
Konagon,butt
ryanscott1986,Dat ass
mikmanik2117,State of cake
RainbowReaper22,"""Girl you thicker than a bowl of oatmeal"""
TheRealOrijang,Why are the frames 15 üò≥
Sabbathius,"A lot of people have a hate boner for this game. I get the dev studio is shady and probably won't deliver what they promised, but why not just wait and see when they do finally release something and then judge it based on that."
Highlife29,What a pathetic post ......... complaining the world looks lifeless in an apocalyptic world .......... you have my sympathy bro
Koryovenproof,What a perfect ass
Pale_Ad_7051,Of course it‚Äôs lifeless. It‚Äôs the apocalypse
ericafoxx4082,I'll give it a try
solidshakego,"Oh no, they made a game. Cry about it.  Big youtubers are fucking ruining gaming so much. Gameplay doesn't even look bad given the genre and the studios game history. Looks better than DayZ and people still cream over that game. It's amazing really how many people don't have their own opinions anymore.."
Sam-Gunn,"So... like DayZ? 

5 hours in game, 1 zombie seen, and I get stuck in a building and rage quit."
