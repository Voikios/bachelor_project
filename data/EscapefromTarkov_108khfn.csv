RickSanchez_,The rocks below there are a great place to go prone and snipe. Everyone checks dome. Few people check the rocks.

Rotta_ODe,Tbh I was expecting a fail video but I thought it would be a clip of scav counter snipping and getting his own sbh
felixbfk,Only three more kills to go now! Nice work
GuycombThreepgood,"Jump skid never gives, always takes.

If you spawn down to the right of thereyou can go straight ahead to rocks and catch players running accross!"

mo_bozzy,"oh boi, that dry ""kurwa"" followed by the PMC ""I'm a goner, I'm done"" was just too funny."
Grizzly4nicator,"If it makes you feel any better, I Tarkov'd myself twice in a row last night. 

1) Had an amazing run on Woods and finished up some quests, got a couple of good guns and lots of gear. Got to the vehicle extract and was 2k rubles short...then proceeded to get smoked by the OOB sniper while trying to figure out where those extra 2k rubles went...lost it all.

2) Decided I'd do a scav run before calling it a night. Had moved a bunch of gear onto my PMC to free up stash space...wasn't paying attention and launched a PMC raid. Spawned in and immediately got lit up by a scav. Lost all that too.

Good news? My stash has LOTS of free space now!"
RepresentativeOk3233,I mean you gonna really try that Quest when you need to achieve the 3 HS kills on Streets too? Where you dont really have that Long and useable sightlines?!
