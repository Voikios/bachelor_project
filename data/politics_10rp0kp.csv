charcoalist,"He'd also spend exactly $199.99 at a time there, just below the level requiring preservation of receipts.  


>Santos, it should be said, is really good at spending just $199.99 almost everywhere he goes—his financial disclosure forms show him spending that exact amount at a Hyatt Orlando (in July 2021), on Delta Airlines and at BJ’s Wholesale (August 2021), at Target and on “Uber” (October 2021), and at many other establishments or services including W Hotel South Beach, JFK Parking, Best Buy, Walgreens, and the TSA line-skipping company Clear.

[I ate at the Italian restaurant where Santos is often, for some reason, spending exactly $199.99.](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/01/george-santos-il-bacco-campaign-spending-new-york.html)

EarthExile,"I don't want to make assumptions, but that sure does have Mafia vapors wafting off it"
GiantWaterfall,"My first thought was he balled out on some First Growth Premiere Cru or something, but the most expensive bottle they have listed is Dom for $285. How TF did they spend $26,000 there?"
Separate_Bluebird161,I mean he’s a three-time rigatoni eating champion so this shouldn’t be a surprise.
Necessary_Row_4889,I’ve eaten at Not an Obvious Front and their bolognese is lovely. Just avoid it Mondays sometimes the grinder still has some snitch in it leftover from the weekend.

jcaccountingeducator,"This sounds absurd, but hear me out: what if George Santos is actually just another character of Roger from American Dad. He's gay, loves being in costumes and lies constantly. His backstory makes no sense whatsoever, his name sounds like a fake politician name (George Washington + Matt Santos from The West Wing = George Santos).

This would also explain the levels of consumption of rigatoni which would be required for this to make sense."
KyotoGaijin,"""Leave the tumor in the dog. Take the cannoli."""
rodut1999,I’m waiting for someone to catch him doing something honest.
lehigh_larry,He laundered the Ponzi scheme money through his campaign.

KevinDean4599,Santos is probably a gift to the republicans.  everyone focuses on his bullshit while the others quietly fuck stuff up unnoticed by the press
IsGoingTTaM,So more laws have been broken without consequences. Sounds about right! So many GOP criminals in elected seats…drain the GOP swamp!
Starrion,So he is a money laundering system
Loreki,"I don't get it. All of the other stories about this guy show really obviously that he's a fraud.

This one's just about how he enjoys a completely normal quantity of Italian food???"
Wart-Boy,"Tomorrow’s headline:

Italian Restaurant In Queens Says Never Served George Santos"
Commie_EntSniper,"FTFY: George Santos' campaign ~~spent~~ laundered more than $26,000 at an Italian restaurant in Queens."
justintuck1,Smells like money laundering.
AvogadrosMoleSauce,"I expect he will release a statement along the lines of, ""George Santos is a competitive eater and has won national awards in it including the Presidential Medal of Freedom which was personally handed to him by Ronald Reagan."""
HairTop23,"We need to be digging into ALL POLITICIANS finances and holding. Them. Accountable. I'm sick of the same story over and over, make them face consequences"
notoriousbpg,"So the hypothesis is that his entire campaign was ONLY meant to be a money laundering operation, and he accidentally flipped the seat and won, bringing attention to it?  


This fits Occam's razor."
oDDmON,Money laundering?  If it looks like a duck…
baseketball,So many politicians are grifting within the law with very little effort and this guy is too lazy and/or stupid to do even that.

YourFairyGodmother,"
>George Santos' campaign spent more than $26,000 at an Italian restaurant in Queens. 

No, he _reported spending_ 26 large.  Did he _actually_ spend that money or was he doing some laundry?  There are a number of ways that number would get recorded, none of them entailing spending it a restaurant."
NarfledGarthak,People voted for this fucking guy.  Unbelievable
PULLS-NOSE-HAIRS,Why is he paying for his food there? He is the head cook at that restaurant and should be eating for free.
PatrickSebast,This is actually probably one of the more normal political things Santos has done tbh
Shadow_Bananas,Wait until you find out how much he spent on Queens 🤫
New_Scientist_8622,"""Youse want the support of the Teamsters, don't ya?"""
mildysentary,Yes but how many football fields worth of Bolognese is that? Or length in number of buses?

kleptophobiac,Wine.
AnitaVahmit,oh hey. he spent more money at a restaurant than i would get from biden's student loan forgiveness plan. also spent the same amount of money that would take me over 6 months to make at my 40+ hours a week job. cool.
sal6056,"This is the same restaurant Republican NYC Councilmember Vickie Paladino held her anti-vax party and conga-line during the COVID pandemic that resulted in a bunch of people contracting COVID. This restaurant is a go-to spot for Republican fuckery. As some of the other comments have pointed out, the restaurant's owner has suspicious ties to criminal activity and the Santos circle."
Minimum_Season_9501,Looks like a normal Republican to me.
Deadwing2022,He's the perfect Republican.  A shameless liar & grifter.

Wise-Bumblebee4932,Money laundering.
roughingupthesuspect,With a side of money laundering…
megdoo2,"Wow, and conservatives are about fiscal responsibility 🤔"
RequalsC0m,Does the law not have common sense? Why are republicans allowed to act like Soviet commies laundering money corrupting our systems and lying their ass off about it. This is exactly the behavior you would see in Soviet Russia.

AdPure4977,Money laundering
albiondave,"This money laundering right?   Top donors to his campaign don't exist, can't be traced, dispute the amount given...

...recipients of his spending include unfeasibly large restaurant bills.

Grinstaiam,They could have used the right pasta in the picture
hotkarl628,Do they have a laundromat in the back?!?
DavidGlennCox,That is likely the source of George's mystery loans. That's where the boss likes keep his office and does his business.
AbbreviationsFair515,Money laundering that’s what it’s called
ResoluteClover,"Sure, his lies are pretty brazen...but let's not forget that nearly every Republican Senator that's opened their mouths has blatantly lied about their positions on the floor and during campaigns.

How many times do we need to bring up ""the mcconnell rule"" or play Lindsey Graham saying one thing and then saying the opposite?

They're all completely shameless hypocrites, the only difference is that their constituents love it."
genuinederp,We should measure Santos's expense in terms of homeless vets dying dog he scammed. So that is 8 and 2/3 dying dogs.
sync-centre,Money Laundering.
Siollear,"Thanks for the break down, I think we should measure all political money scandals in Rigatoni Bolegnese now."

jimkelly,I'm from New Jersey and I know a guy who owns an Italian restaurant in queens...just saying
Away-Engineering37,He's not in jail yet? All they need to prosecute him is evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. He's already surpassed that to beyond any doubt.
HiddenInLight,"This is the new reality with today's republican party. They are more interested in winning and lining their own pockets than actually running a government in the best interest of the people they represent.

ListentotheLemon,I'm struggling to comprehend the money spent. Could you give it to me in lasagnas instead?
photograft,Silly. He should have ordered the “Riganelection Bolognese”
VoxClarus,"I really appreciate the use of ""rigatoni bolognese"" as a unit of measure and would love to see it in more news stories. lol"
EminentBean,Could this be… money laundering?
Astro_Astro,He’s been taught by every single member of Congress and the executive branch that politicians can do whatever the hell they want in this country with zero repercussions.
piperonyl,Is there someone out there looking into some of these other shitbag congresspeople's campaign funds as well?

allnamestaken1968,"Hahah. CLEAR is 189 and gives you an electronic receipt. So clear fraud for $10 there. No multiply with every meal. Basically, he is laying himself and claims it’s a business expense at a friend’s restaurant.

HtiekMij,26 boxes of ziti.
deepfinker,Now that is supporting local business /s
Highwaters78217,$22.98 is outrageous for a plate of pasta and sauce. They obviously drank a lot of cheap red wine with their meals in order for the price to be so high.

Fig1024,"why is it so difficult to find where he got $750000 from? don't banks monitor all transactions of 10,000 or more? Unless he came to the bank with a briefcase full of $100 bills, there should be a record of who sent that money"

Throwitawaynow31422,Damnit now I want Italian.
Redjeezy,"The appetizers did, in fact, cure cancer."
Blaze_News,"It’s undoubtedly ~$200 in food and then $25,800 of absurdly overpriced wine. There is an Italian restaurant in town where the meals are generally in the $30-$50 range, but their wine list is a small book with wines reaching into the thousands per bottle easily.

Went there with a significant other a while back, and was flipping through the wine list for a while - S/O says “just pick whatever, doesn’t matter to me” and I had to quietly tell her I was looking for a bottle under $75… there was only one or two on the entire list."
Chad_Megabuldge,I feel like rigatoni is a bad noodle shape for bolognese.
Slackjawedlocal,It’s old man Withers from the haunted amusement park.
