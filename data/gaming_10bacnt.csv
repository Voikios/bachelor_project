NinjaPussyPounder,"""shit medic"""
rawwrrob,"Me and my friends used to play COD and COD:Zombies nearly every night after school. One of my friends was exactly like this comic. In Zombies, I was good at dodging and knew the routes well so I was usually the one who'd stay alive longest and would revive people when they were downed in a round. Fine, no prob. They can still contribute and we can help get their perks back eventually.

However, so many goddamn times, this one motherfucker would say ""Hold on. I'm gonna go grab Juggernog. I have time. Don't worry."" right as a round was starting and run off alone with the rest of us begging him to wait. 30s later ""Oh shit. I'm down. Come rez me quick!"" At first, me and the rest of the team would try to save him, but most of the time it would end up with a team wipe. He'd also whine constantly about his lost stuff when he died. So eventually, when he'd try that again, I'd just say ""Don't go now. You will go down and I will sit and watch you die even if I can save you. And I'll do the same for any dumb fuck that tries to help him."" Then I let him die every single time he pulled that crap. Took him several weeks to learn, but he finally gave in and allowed us to help him get his perks at a better time.

He did the same thing in multiplayer constantly too.

""Don't go out there. Literally everyone on the map has line of sight on that window. You're gonna get sniped."" 

""I'll be fine.""

*literally 5s later*

*bloodsplat* ""Dammit! I'm dead..."""
YetAnotherSegfault,It‚Äôs missing the part where you go in for a risky revive and they just disconnect when you get there.
thejml2000,LeeeeeeeeeeRooooooy!!!!
hikdr,That's when you start shooting your own team to finish the job
Definitely_Dopey,Was this meme made specifically for Apex? Those guns look like the Hemlok and Peacekeeper
Keshire,"When I watch my kids play I like to commentate their healer kills out loud like it's some type of baseball stat. ""That's the 3rd healer you got killed by asking for a rez in a hot zone""."
Soulfliktion_,Ey that's my trusty Hemlok!
OldAssPirate,I think there's a little Leroy Jenkins in all of us.

Nat_Higgins,"Don‚Äôt intervene. If you do, they‚Äôll never learn."
,"More accurate is one idiot rushing in. A nice and helpful, but ultimately still stupid, idiot rushes in to save him.

And then you are left just watching wondering what to do."

zdakat,"""Why didn't you cover me?""  
Because it would've taken longer to get there, would've been more exposed, and there were way too many enemies out there to (be able to) make it safe to do whatever it is you were trying to do."
johndepp22,actually lol‚Äôd

Creepy-Trust4266,"Reason I stopped playing battle royale games as a newbie. My teammates would rush while I would try to play safe and then when they would be down, they would shout at me for not having the skills to kill 3 enemies by myself and revive them."
fyrejakk0001,"Leeroy Jenkins syndrome!
Tbh reminds me of old days in WOW."
Jessaoir,"Just Russian battle tactics, nothing special to see here"
CanadianDragonGuy,"I mean, I'll admit, I do that, but i do it because i cant hit for shit at distance and when you get up close and personal, and I mean within smooching distance most people's brains just short out and they cant track you decently enough to get you, then it's a straight fight"

_99Percent,‚ÄúBro revive‚Äù those are some nice teammates! I usually get ‚ÄúWhere were you!‚Äù As if me not dying with them was proof I‚Äôm standing around not doing anything.
Munkey149,"Yep.. One of my gaming buddies always goes off on his own after we decide to move as a group and always ends up getting downed, like clock work, and then immediately does the ""please come revive me!!"" stick over and over whilst we're taking fire from the squad that he got taken out by. 

So the other day we decided as a group that whenever he gets downed because he split from the group, we mute him, finish up what we have to (taking out everyone in the area, restocking and healing up) then revive if we have the time. 

We don't really mind the getting downed part, the screeching into the mic for a revive is whats annoying.. Especially 3 times per game, every game."
Roy_8886,"That's Overwatch ""2"" in a nutshell, for both sides really... playing as a tank character, you try to advance and expect the support to sustain your health, but they never come... and if you play as the support, you see the tank and especially the dps characters advancing way too much and you can't support them (unless you play as Zenyatta). It's a eternal cycle of bad gameplay design aligned with bad players. That's why I gave up on these multiplayer games, to rely on human ""intelligence"" is more annoying than interacting with the AI, this hobby is supposed to be fun and entertaining, not a exercise in frustration (and yeah, I know the ""Souls"" niche and oldschool games in general relies on punishing AI to increase frustration, but that's a whole nother can of worms)"
Sea_Art3391,"This is definetly like my friends. When i try to explain what the problem is, they just go ""hurr durr the point of the game is to shoot the enemy, it's not fun to sneak around and not shooting"" yeah Thomas great argument to running straight into a meat grinder."
bigedthebad,"I was playing healer in a pickup group in WoW, can‚Äôt remember the dungeon. 

Everything was going fine and we were waiting outside a room when the tank, without a word to anyone, runs inside and makes a left, breaking my line of sight. He comes back out about a second later trailing about a dozen mobs and immediately dies at my feet. He then starts screaming at me for not healing him. 

I just took off running and when I got to safety, logged out."
Paul873873,"My group actually uses tactics when we do bunkers in star citizen because I‚Äôm blind. They could probably just rush the place and be done with it, but they help me enjoy the missions despite my visual impairments. I love my friends"
NickFoster120,This is truly an Apex experience.
1nfam0us,I had this happen when I was playing Apex Legends around when it first launched.  I got paired up with a couple guys who were obviously on coms and would only use in game chat to yell at me.  First they ran off and wouldn't let me loot so I had mismatched guns and ammo.  They got mad when I hadnt noticed they dipped without communicating.  I spent a good couple minutes trying to catch up but they kept sprinting away from me.  Eventually they ran headlong into an ambush and got downed in about 5 seconds.  I was still like 200 meters away.  They blamed me for being bad and rage quit as if I could have done anything.
blackmobius,"Apex Legends summary.

I once played a game where a teammate announced out of nowhere they were not in the mood to carry and wouldnt revive. Guess who overplayed and got downed. Guess who whined about being downed and screamed at us to revive him."
DataKing69,This looks like russia's perspective in their current invasion.
JasonSuave,100% true.  Rushers never listen to strategists in Fortnite.  Losses always attributed to the rushers in squads imo
ChairmanUzamaoki,"Everytime I'd play Overwatch with my buddy he would do something similar. He wouldn't play for months, then come back and pick a pretty difficult hero, like Genji. I'd warn him Genji is difficult and he'd get his ass beat and he would insist. Then he'd get his ass beat, say the game sucks, and play Fortnite for the next 183 hours"
SonicBoom500,"About at least half of the time, I‚Äôd die trying to res them üòÖ"
forevernovice1,"An team collectively doing the same stupid thing is a plan. I follow my teammates call-outs - even the ones I think are stupid because if they're gonna do the dumb thing anyway, if I'm doing it with them there's a greater chance that it works. Sure it might not work a lot of the time, but the times that it does are always so rewarding. Win or lose you have fun with your teammates which is the whole point of playing team based multiplayer games."
TheRisen073,"Y‚Äôall have teammates? Let alone teammates that rush and get killed? I rush squads all the time and I‚Äôm fine. And no, I‚Äôm not like, Onyx rank or anything, I‚Äôm average, I‚Äôm just batshit insane."

kidanokun,"Exactly why don't play competitive team fps games anymore, I can't resist the temptation to rush"
TerraTerrarium,"I would give plans to my team in games but most of the time they do not ever listen to it. They never open chat,

Hikaru1024,"Always happened when I was the medic.

Teri_Windwalker,"That takes me back to Dota. Specifically early Dota. I don't mean early in development of the game, I mean ""Early Game"" as in when the Carry you're babysitting is an *infant* and they decide they can take out an offlaner, who was chosen because they can handle a beating and don't need much to get going, and they'd have won if *""only you helped me!""*

BurntRussianBBQ,"Also, if you take time to set up an engagement with a squad, if things go south you can have a plan to disengage. If you start shooting Nd quickly one of your guys is downed, and they have fire superiority, it's time to GO. Too many times people just think somehow they will pull out a win-or are just hungry for kills."

Ordinary-Flounder675,"This is my one friend on Fortnite. I can‚Äôt count how many times he has seen enemies and rushed them when he would‚Äôve had a clean shot with a sniper. They would‚Äôve had a perfect kill without them noticing if he hadn‚Äôt rushed in. It constantly leads to our team losing. He might as well shoot his gun in the air and yell, ‚Äúwitness me!‚Äù"
