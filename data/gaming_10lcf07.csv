NaturalNines,"Just curious, but does your painting style shift from the details to the environment? Do you go Bob Ross for the scenery, but then paint the specifics of the towers and whatnot over that?"

KGB_Panda,"Often I when I see fantasy artwork, it sparks my imagination and I daydream about the world and what's in it. I wish to myself that it could be brought to life, and I could explore it and go on an adventure. 

It is so, so, so incredible that I can do that this time.  

You're a very talented artist, thank you for sharing."

MaTth1as_za,Amazzzing stuff! Drop your insta handle for us üòÅ
Oddmakesart,Fuck yeah brother.
milk4all,"I know ill never get it but i would skeet so hard for an elden rings prequel. How dope to play the original Greater Will pawn tasked with fighting back the Crucible and demi humans or something. Because of the way the world is, the world map could be completely different or the same or anywhere in between (!). Or some tarnished with Godfrey to battle the Giants. Or the Rotclean Knight who inevitably drags Malenia to the Haligtree - that could be some sort of take on the grace system with ‚Äúusing‚Äù her for basic rpg functions like leveling/saving/resting while moving the story place to place abd doing dark souls things."
