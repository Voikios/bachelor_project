The Two Santas Strategy: How the GOP has used an economic scam to manipulate Americans for 40 years

It’s a tribalistic fugazi."
wrath0110,"The dire warnings of fiscal hawks are once again darkening the skies of official Washington.

They’re demanding that the $31.4tn federal debt be reduced and government spending curtailed – thereby giving cover to Republican efforts to hold America hostage by refusing to raise the debt ceiling.

It’s always the same when Republicans take over a chamber of Congress or the presidency. Horrors! The debt is out of control! Federal spending must be cut!

When they’re in power, they rack up giant deficits, mainly by cutting taxes on corporations and the wealthy (which amount to the same thing, since wealthy investors are the major beneficiaries of corporate tax cuts).

Then when Democrats take the reins, Republicans blame them for being spendthrifts.

Not only is the Republican story false, but it leaves out the bigger and more important story behind today’s federal debt: the switch by America’s wealthy over the last half century from paying taxes to the government to lending the government money.

This backstory needs to be told if Americans are to understand what’s really happened and what needs to be done about it. Republicans won’t tell it, so Democrats (starting with Joe Biden) must.

A half century ago, American’s wealthy helped finance the federal government mainly through their tax payments.

Tax rates on the wealthy were high. Under Republican president Dwight Eisenhower, they were over 90%. Even after all tax deductions, the wealthy typically paid half of their incomes in taxes.

Since then – courtesy of tax cuts under Ronald Reagan, George W Bush, and Donald Trump – the effective tax rate on wealthy Americans has plummeted.

Not only has their income tax rate dropped but other taxes that hit them hardest, such as the corporate tax, have also declined.

Even as the rich have accumulated unprecedented wealth, they are now paying a lower tax rate than middle-class Americans.

Trump’s 2017 tax cut – largely a handout to the rich – helped push the tax rate on the 400 wealthiest households below the rates for almost everyone else.

By 2018, the 400 wealthiest American households paid a lower total tax rate – including federal, state, and local taxes – than any other income group. Their overall tax rate was only 23%. It had been 70% in 1950.

Middle-class and poor families didn’t benefit from the drop in income and corporate taxes. They now pay more in payroll taxes (which finance Medicare and Social Security) than previously, so their overall taxes have remained fairly flat.

One of the biggest reasons the federal debt has exploded is that tax cuts on corporations and wealthier Americans have reduced government revenue.

In the first full year of the Trump tax cut, the federal budget deficit increased by $113bn while corporate tax receipts fell by about $90bn, which would account for nearly 80% of the deficit increase.

Meanwhile, America’s wealthy have been financing America’s exploding debt by lending the federal government money, for which the government pays them interest.

As the federal debt continues to mount, these interest payments are ballooning – hitting a record $475bn in the last fiscal next year (which ran through September). The Congressional Budget Office predicts that interest payments on the federal debt will reach 3.3% of the GDP by 2032 and 7.2% by 2052.

The biggest recipients of these interest payments? Not foreigners but wealthy Americans who park their savings in treasury bonds held by mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds, banks, insurance companies, personal trusts and estates.

Hence the giant half-century switch: the wealthy used to pay higher taxes to the government. Now the government pays the wealthy interest on their loans to finance a swelling debt that’s been caused largely by lower taxes on the wealthy.

This means that a growing portion of everyone else’s taxes are going to wealthy Americans in the form of interest payments, rather than paying for government services that everyone needs.

So, the real problem isn’t America’s growing federal budget deficit. It’s the decline in tax revenue from America’s wealthy combined with growing interest payments to them.

Both are worsening America’s already staggering inequalities of income and wealth.

What should be done? Isn’t it obvious? Raise taxes on the wealthy."
robodrew,"It's easy if you aren't being lied to.  Bush tax cuts of the 00s (which destroyed the budget SURPLUS that Clinton left office with), followed by a financial crisis and TARP, followed by the Trump tax cuts, followed by a pandemic.  All of these things combined to create a huge cost to the US that manifested as national debt.  The important detail here is that two of these four situations were not caused by the government at all (but required huge governmental intervention) while the other two were directly caused by Republican actions."

General_Tso75,Truth won’t feed the GOP outrage machine or fit into the narrative of evil liberals.
OptimisticRealist__,"Just for the record, Bill Clintons economic policies decreased the US deficit until Bush blew it up with his war crimes. That plus the lack of oversight under Bush led to the financial crisis, which again put a strain of the budget, but even then Obama worked to decrease it.

So as a rule of thumb it is true that Dems tend to decrease the deficit and the party of fiscal responsibility increases it.

EaglesPDX,"One missing piece from the Guardian story, which focus on rich and corporations no longer paying taxes, is what the taxes are spent on.

70% of the US debt is from the unfunded military spending because 70% of US spending in discretionary budget is military spending.  SS/Medicare are self funded, have a $1T surplus and have not contributed anything to US debt.

The result has been near constant war by US since the 1980's when the tax cuts for rich and gross overspending on US military began, aka Reaganomics.

There's a maxim that countries that build offensive military capability have to either use it or cut back, US has used it.    We see continued new wars being advocated to justify more spending.  The latest being war with China which spends 60% less than US on military and that in response to US military bases on China's borders.

US has 700 overseas military bases.

US has 18 aircraft carriers to Russia/China combined 4.

US has waged war of occupation in the Middle East for 30 years with the buildup to that war starting in 1980, Reaganomics.

As we see in Ukraine, US after all that spending, does not have enough basic military supplies for Ukraine to fight Russia.

US military spending is $1.2T per year counting Pentagon and other military spending from Dept of Energy to NASA to CIA/NSA to even VA.

Cut US military spending 50% to $500B vs. Russia and China combined $350B.  Restore income tax to the Trump, Bezos, Musks, Exxons, Amazons et al and US pays off the debt the rich and the military created."

superSaganzaPPa86,"So tl;dr would be that since the richest people had their taxes cut so much, a lot of that extra money they saved went to Treasury Bonds. So not only does the government not get the money they cut in taxes, the government now takes on that money as debt to these rich people  who are now entitled to whatever the interest is on that loan.

How do we stop that bleeding? Is it as simple as bringing the tax rates on the wealthiest Americans back to Eisenhower levels? 

Has anyone in Congress proposed a bill to just ""try it for a year""? What if we did that... said ""hey we tried this trickle down thing for a couple decades and it really hasn't worked like Reagan promised. Lets try something else and just see."" I mean its the whole doing the same thing and expecting a different result."
aquarain,"In 2000 under Bill Clinton's Administration the federal government had held a budget surplus for two years - perhaps the final budget surpluses ever.

Those internal documents were closely held for some time until discovered and revealed in an FOIA request.

So if I did my math right which is entirely possible I didn't that is a 26% increase from Trumps 2019 to 2022 total. Of which from his 2020 year as zero that means Biden has increased the debt by 9.97% in that time. So 61% of the debt McCarthy is trying to leverage came from trump.

ScampersInATuxedo,"I typically respect articles from Reich, but he's off the mark with this one, and in a very disappointing way.

Some of what he said is true: we did tax the rich. But it's important to understand how, because much has changed between then and now.

In order to tax, there has to be income. Here's an example of this from his article:

>They now pay more in payroll taxes

This is what he mentions about the American middle class, and he's not wrong.

But notice the words used: payroll taxes.

This obscures why Americans don't understand the situation, so here's a better example as I know many of you don't understand.

Many Americans pay into a 401K as part of their retirement portfolio. Not only are the monies invested into the plan not taxed, Americans are not taxed until there is a withdraw, which should happen when they retire. Early penalties and taxes are applied if the 401K plan is emptied before retirement.

\*THIS\* is critical to understand, because the wealthy don't pay taxes, just as Americans don't pay taxes on their 401K.

Only when the dividends are paid out (income) can tax be applied, and be thankful for this, as Americans would suffer tremendously if their 401K was taxed before retirement.

What the Republicans have done wasn't to ""shave off taxes"" to the rich. They did something far, far worse: they destroyed regulations governed by the SEC so the rich can manipulate the stock market.

This is absolutely critical to understand, because the loss of regulations is why the wealthy now owns more than 50% of the stocks sold, and the number is increasing.

The \*ownership\* of stocks is pretty much income to the wealthy. They don't need money, because everything they own is on credit. 

Have you ever heard the term ""other people's money""? This is what the rich do, and thanks to legal loopholes which allows them to distribute wealth outside the country (tax free) as well as setting shells upon shells to hide true ownership, there wouldn't be any income to tax in the first place.

In the early 2000s, the greatest tax avoidance scheme was introduced. Called the ""Double Irish"", it allowed investors to move billions of dollars, untaxed, outside the country. The money has never returned, and because it was ""legal"", there's nothing to be done.

Loopholes like this were intentional, just as they are today. That Orange Asshole's ""tax credit"" wasn't a credit at all. All the shithead did was to extend the loopholes they had already received, while placing the burden on Americans to pay the government shortfall.

The piece of shit is literally the reason why the deficit is in the trillions, and now the country is paying for it in the worse way possible.

The solution isn't to tax the rich. There's nothing to tax.

The solution is to restore the SEC regulations and laws, force all capital gains earned from the past 40 years deregulated into taxable income, and \*then\* tax the hell out of these fucking assholes.

Until this is done, there's no rich income to tax."
mw19078,"all of this seems to be lost on most people on both sides of the isle, but the debt means absolutely nothing. it has almost zero impact on us now or in the future, and it almost certainly never will. both sides use it as some political talking point but at the end of the day we are always going to run a deficit and it doesnt really mean that much"

Blarghnog,"I know this is deeply political, but can we pull up for a second? The US is in the deepest of shit, and each party is blaming the other for it, but it keeps getting worse. The US national debt ceiling has risen consistently no matter who is in office.

Here’s an older example:

But as you can see, it’s consistent to present day across political parties:

We are deficit spending on our base budgets long before any crisis, and it will lead to a debt/currency crisis inevitably as long as we continue to behavior, as it [always has in history](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1995b_bpea_dornbusch_goldfajn_valdes_edwards_bruno.pdf):

https://i.imgur.com/skTbvxq.jpg

The governments of late stage governments typically don’t want to confront their spending because it means austerity and the resulting unpopularity. [Empires typically spend until collapse](https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/pentagon-study-declares-american-empire-is-collapsing), because printing money is so much easier than confronting reality and committing political suicide in doing so.

Don’t fall for the party angle. It hardly matters as both parties are spending until collapse. It’s no different than blaming different people while the well runs dry, but nobody will turn the water off.

In the end, who let the tap run dry is *everyone* at the well. And when it does nobody is going to care about the color of your failed empires flag.

chubba5000,"So I say this only out of concern for common sense and narrative continuity: either one of two things must be true, but not both simultaneously:    

1. “31T in debt is no big deal, we’ve always had debt, and let’s just take on some more.”  In which case I assume the argument would be that Republicans are doing a good thing by adding to the debt, because it simply doesn’t matter.     

2. “31T is a big deal, but the republicans are by far the worst offenders.” In which case the argument necessitates that debt is harmful, and we must come to our senses to rein it in.     

What I cringe at seeing is “the debt is no big deal, _but even if it was_ republicans did it.” This shows someone who has no interest in attacking the practical realities here and is simply a political sock puppet. Don’t be a sock puppet. Let reason lead the way, it’s liberating."
