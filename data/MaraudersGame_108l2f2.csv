METTTHEDOC,I'm dying. Legitimate laughing my ass off in my shop. THANK you for this
ragnarmcryan,I doubt Griswold memes will be appreciated here. That film was made before most players here were a twinkle in their fathersâ€™ eye
smith72121,"Iâ€™m assuming you checked the immediate area? Loads of times Iâ€™ve had to search for the Luger. They seem to bounce around when you spawn, theyâ€™re not always on the table and the Luger is the hardest thing to find if it lands on the floor. Just take the fire extinguishers and split is all Iâ€™d do if youâ€™re not already getting shot at ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
Alveuus,"This is the greatest cross-over ever

I love this movie and watch it every year for Christmas"
MaxIrons,"Had that be the start to a crazy run.  No luger? No problems.  I'm a rat anyways right?  

Sneak my way to the drill pit, because a firearm usually spawns there.  One did.  Shark sneak shoot loot sneak... escape with a glitch where somehow I'm wearing both a ""ghost"" harness and a leather jerkin as well as ghost weapons & equipment.  

Multiple restarts later things seem to correct themselves.  Submit a bug report, giggle into my new friend Mr. Johnson and his BAR buddy.  

Game said F1.  I said F1 F1 and a ""How 'Bout I Do Anyway!""  Profit was minimal,  the fun? Maximum."
