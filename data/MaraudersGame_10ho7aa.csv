epicguy600,Wait what my Mosin doesn't have a red dot? Unless..... I'm slow.
appa_the_magic_bum,You scrap it and make a terminator
Demonic--Mango,"Just below the red dot, it's hard to aim yeaðŸ˜‚ even the reloading animation seems unfinished"
Big_Kemba_J,I would aim it if I had itâ€¦
DoucheyCohost,"I see they've accurately represented the Mosin, then"
HeadbangingWalrus88,The mosin is just a meme weapon practically - it's really not good
twignition,"Aim for the chin, it's still a headshot and doesn't matter if you're a little high"
Oh_Love,i like using it with the SVT and using the mosin for close quarters since itâ€™s easier to just put it in the center of their head with the one shot you got
