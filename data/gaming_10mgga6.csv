Method__Man,"""Wasted""

entirely fine 12 minutes later."
PatRice4Evra,"""Well we haven't seen him for a few minutes, let's just forget about all the crimes he just committed."""
Tokes_ACK,"Fun fact: the fine for being ""Busted"" or ""Wasted"" has always been 10% of your wallet. Less money on hand=smaller bribes.

Edit: Fun fact: you can get blackout-drunk and say factually incorrect shit, and still receive upvotes, apparently, lol"
Just_an_Empath,"Daily karmafarm repost.

See you guys in popular !"
Cabamacadaf,It wouldn't be a very fun game if you couldn't play the game anymore after being arrested.
Evo_Kaer,"Cops don't set the fines, they just enforce them"
Fruhmann,More Prosecutors in major US cities than the cops.
bike_tyson,Just like LA
,What do players want? do they want the game to be over when you‚Äôre arrested? do they want to have to wait 45 years in real time to make it seem more realistic? üòÇ
Cvo777,Holy crap this meme is so old
sofalofa04,GTA logic? I thought it was SEC logic for big corporate.
OlDirtyBAStart,Good lord did someone open a portal from 2007 9gag?

Isuckmangosforalivin,"Tbh it‚Äôs probably not a fine, you‚Äôre just bribing the cop"
L3monSqueezy,I think ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù would be more appropriate
MoobooMagoo,"I thought it was a bribe? Like you're just paying 300 bucks to not process you, basically.

Although that said, it's still unrealistic that you've got millions of dollars and the bribe amount doesn't increase."
ChrisMassacre,Judiciary logic for white collar crimes
AngryAntArmy,At least they show up. Which makes them better than most cops in reality
thatbearguy2202,Sooo how many people would play the game if every time you got arrested you served 5 years?
zoki671,This is how life is for rich people
MyHamburgerLovesMe,Isn't this just for Rich people and politicians kids though?

wildraft1,So...Chicago?
HEY_PAUL,Tommy Vercetti is an innocent man!
bladnoch16,You spelled New York wrong‚Ä¶
MuthafuckinLemonLime,Arrested? The cops shoot to kill for most things in GTA. But don‚Äôt let me get in the way of your ‚ÄúTHIS IS A SOCIETY‚Äù comments everyone.
InterstellarReddit,That‚Äôs how they treat rich people tho
Don_BAYONETS,Sounds like California.
that_other_guy_,Also California DA logic
0verClover,Cop logic? This is literally California courts right now lmao
jsm1095,"Lol this is California, murder you can get back on the street later but larceny they just don‚Äôt bother arresting you anymore bc prosecutors won‚Äôt press charges."
IamUltimatelyWin,This is just accurate for California at this point.
AssLynx,"You just killed half a city. 

Pays fine."

doctorcrimson,"Technically, he got his sentence delayed and he has to pay of his fines in monthly installments because of the corrupt and overcrowded US Justice System.  You just never pay any more of the fines, cuz you're a gangster."
Force3vo,GTA cop logic: we slightly bumped into the car in front of us. SHOOT THE DRIVER DEAD!!!!
FirstGen_Burrito,"It would be a badass game mode if they actually took you to an island penitentiary where you have to find a way to escape and you can recruit other prisoners to start a riot. 

That would be a sick game mode"
Skinny____Pete,That is not my experience. Its more like the United States where they shoot and kill you for nothing.

Shodan30,Also New York and Chicago.
myevillaugh,"Don't they also take your guns? IIRC, it was better to get killed by the police. Then you just have a small hospital bill, and you're free."
Elbradamontes,Uh‚Ä¶do we still get fined? Honestly the only thing I worry about is having to pick up my car and spawning on a mountaintop.
,[deleted]
CasualFriday11,The 'Riot Games' method of punishment.
dude19832,Both RDR2 and GTA5 have the same logic. Cause chaos and you get killed but come back to life to start again. You get jailed and you just pay a fine no matter what the damage is. Lol üòÇ
plzhelpme11111111111,either you're bribing the cop or you have a really good lawyer
AlmightyMrP,"Sometimes I drive around and look for cops that have their siren on then start following them, if they aren't already chasing someone down they usually ram someone at a complete stop and then the chase is on or the driver gets out. Either way it always ends in a shootout."

DiscipleHAC,"Was looking through old gta iv and v videos and the comparison in aggressiveness between the cops was hilarious to see. 

I believe it was GTA V where they'd get triggered in an instant. HEY YOU STOP BOOM BOOM"
Mrdrewit,"Imagine how short of a life GTA would've lived if they discouraged random killings with hard consequences. 

""Alright, you got ten minutes of a court scene for killing that pedestrian and then you get a time jump to when you get out of prison and then you only have so much time before your character dies of old age, oh yeah, and you're super weak and slow now."""
Shpongolese,"Its a video game. With that being said, get on an RP server and you can get your own actual prison sentences! #FiveM"

michaelawagner,Knock some over and you die
SpiritedDecision1986,"Arrested? Bitch please..im a god.

\*obliterate local police force and refuses to elaborate."
Notequal_exe,I regularly run people over in Cyberpunk and get away with it because the NCPD doesn't want to chase my stolen car.
Literally_Pepe,"I think the next GTA game should have levels of difficulty that reflect how laws are realistically enforced in addition to damage received from injuries and number of weapons + ammo able to be carried.

Would be interesting gameplay trying to avoid the cops the entire rest of the game after committing one act of murder and if you get caught, you have to start over from the very beginning."
Baron_Blackfox,"Cops were great in SA. I once accidentally bumped into a car in front of me, which bumped into police car because of that. Cops stopped and shot the poor people in that car lol"
AlwaysLosingAtLife,Rules for the rich
yankee-bor,"Ok officers, this man snuck onto a military base, stole a jet, shot down several helicopters, blew up dozens of patrol vehicles, and killed 100 fellow officers. He must be taken dow‚Ä¶. Wait did he just go into a night club? Alright pack it up men he got away.

But sir he came right back out there he is!

I said back off! Obviously he is innocent now and we can no longer pursue him!"

azquadcore,It would be pretty cool if getting busted would reset the game
Spanish-Johnny,This meme is older than me

Clayman8,"Idk...sounds pretty american to me really, as long as you got over 8 figures in your bank account."
Aikarion,I've done with police missions so that now they don't even confiscate my weapons.
NukeEngineerStudent,Kinda hard to play the game if your character is given the death penalty.
T1gerAc3,When you're obscenely rich and live in America

Izhyf,So its like how cops are treated in real life. Wow! So realistic!
gibson_guy77,"To be fair, they usually kill you AND fine you."
Ramble81,Is it ever worth being arrested rather than wasted? It's my understanding with the former you lose all of your guns and ammo so it feels like the mechanic gives you a reason to try to hide or escalate.
j-merc23,"The fine isn't for murder, the fine is for allowing yourself to get caught"
so_whaat,"So what do you want, to be arrested and given a life sentence and never be able to play the game again?"
Adawk91,only on reddit can a post about GTA in r/gaming devolve into political activism about taxing the wealthy and criminal justice reform in the comments
kurisu7885,"After the newest DLC came out ""welp, he went inside that truck, he's totally free""."
ZypherPunk,"Yeah, the fine is a bit expensive, which makes it unrealistic."
PooperDuper2per,Game would be pretty shit if you get arrested and then spend the rest of the game in jail.  Kinda fucks with the whole flow of things.
Realistic_Truck,Never knew the Irish justice system was based off GTA.
Ill-Organization-719,Remember in Driver 1? Honk at someone and the police don't stop until you're dead.
AreTheyAllThrowAways,Playing though gta trilogy on the switch slowly when traveling on planes‚Ä¶ Its losing your guns that hurts and costs money :(
PatrickStarburst,"And in real life, cops will put 37 bullets in you if you look at them funny or just sleep in the wrong place."

vt1032,"Or the GTA 5 version:. ""oh, you brushed up against my while walking past?  Time to do a mag dump..."""

youknowiactafool,"IRL Cop Logic (Cop edition)

This is the tenth time you acted as judge, jury and executioner of a civilian.

mcknightrider,"Wait, a ""fine""? I always thought we were bribing the cops with Bush money haha"
Onii-Chan_Itaii,This is true in real life as well if you're in a car

evasive_dendrite,Meanwhile they shoot you to death for bumping into their car... wait that's realism!
marker_dinova,"I mean, they _do_ kill you, soooo‚Ä¶."
Jxx,"that's one of the things i liked about vice city     
if you get busted, there's a little VO of the lawyer guy being like ""my client is completely not guilty"" or w/e, just a nice little nod ""we gonna bribe you, but we'll make it seem like the lawyer just did good at his defense"""

Cookiesniffer12,That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a video game and not real life.
Yollm,It‚Äôs really impressive how they programmed them to be smarter than real life cops.
MocoNinja,"I still remember when I was goofing around in San Andreas and made a taxi land a very tiny scratch on the back of a cop's car. The two cops proceeded to walk off the car, go the taxi, take the guy out and shoot him dead right on the spot and just walk away casually, leaving the car abandoned in the tunnel."
