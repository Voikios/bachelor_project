,The bullet was so fast it went around the earth before hitting the eagle.
Quetzalcoatlasaurus,That shot doesn't seem right. It almost looks spliced together
ItchyDoughnut,"I genuinely do not understand why everyone is getting so upset at OP about this. By some very cursory research it's known that this game is full of bugs. OP never claimed to have done this intentionally, it says accidental right in the post title. Yall need to fuckin relax."
LordVader152,r/taskfailedsuccessfully
onanalbumcover,i don’t care besides curiosity but why is OP being downvoted so hard lol?
Papa_Pred,"Stg everyone that’s blasting OP has never touched a Sniper Elite game 

The games are buggy af but that’s part of the charm lmao. And yes, even the kill cams will cut, they are not always one continuous shot. 

It cuts three times for the most part. Firing the gun so you see the muzzle flash and smoke, the bullet traveling, and then the final impact"
manicmonkey45,OP got killed so hard in the comments the bullet came back and killed them.
Thrakk223,Feelin' like a freak on a leash
Dannu123,"I see people accusing this of being two clips together. Lol, it is not. Even if it was, how do you explain the part where the bullet cam travels from the eagle statue that is in a place inaccessible to the player to a wall of a random building. And even then, anyone who’s played sniper elite knows the bullet cams do not appear unless your shot hits a target, shooting a wall of a random house qould not activate a bullet cam"
User_name098,Most intelligent redditors.
Gimpstick,FREAK ON A LEASH!
Fish_Slapping_Dance,"As the shot is about to hit the eagle from the *front*, it resets, and the bullet comes from the *other side* of the map toward the *back* of the eagle, and it shatters as seen from the *front* on the right side.

My guess, (and this is only a guess), is that, unlike bullet hits to soldiers, this one has a standard playback of the eagle shattering.  Seems like the kill cam started over, just as it's about to hit, so that the end shot shows the eagle shattering from the *front* instead.  It's funny and cool, whatever it is.

Programmers have to cut corners sometimes.  I'm guessing that having only one playback of the eagle exploding saves some effort or space, so recording it exploding from every direction isn't part of the data set.

I think it's a great way to see how game designers do things.  The long bullet travel time is likely used to render a soldier being shot according to your game setting.  This means that a standard animation video takes a different path programmatically, and it ends up with this if you are shooting from the backside.

OP might consider trying the shot from different angles to see if it happens again."
sirprakos,“Oooohh fake you spliced it together” the bullet is going thrrrrrrrooooouuuugh wood it’s obviously a glitch. Plus the bullet switches directions on the impact. Either this is the most well made edit I’ve ever seen or it’s your typical glitch. Very cool either way. People on the internet are traumatized don’t waste your time OP.
gpranav25,I like how people are accusing OP of splicing and downvoting like they submitted a speedrun WR with this included. Guess redditards are too used to people farming karma rather than just enjoying the game.
Cleverbird,"What on earth is with these comments? Its a funny glitch, you freaks, stop trying to find some deeper meaning in this."
Rterry112,"People are trying to call out OP for faking this by splicing two clips. While I personally don’t think they did, if it were the case, the second part of the clip where the glitch cut to is already a crazy enough shot that adding the first part wouldn’t be adding much anyways."
Theo736373,God what happened here? Do people not know what a glitch is? What would op gain by splicing two videos together when he didn’t even claim to have done the trickshot on purpose.
,Bruh wtf. This was straight out of an over the top action movie.
Velrex,"This is one of those games I see a lot of gifs of, but never hear anything about the actual gameplay itself or game."
stef_lp,soomething takes a paart of mee
reassor,No Korn music?
Lord_Ivan_the_Clean,Korn - Freak on a leash vibe
Longjumping_Hat_5970,People are sooo fkn stupid on reddit. You have my upvote sure. Thanks for sharing a pretty neat video of this glitch. You down voting POS get the fuck off the internet!
timecrimehero,"Everyone’s obviously an expert in game dev and video editing here, OP. Cool glitch, sucks you’re getting downvoted to oblivion lol"
wthoutwrning,"Splicing this clip is unnecessary, the second shot is impressive enough to post on its own. Are you people even gamers? Use your heads ffs, clearly it is a glitch"
Humbergo,I believe you OP. Sad that other redditors are attacking you. People are so strange.
TheWhiteBernieMac,"Not bad, next time I’d say go for a testicle explosion tho"
mrbgdn,Why doesn't it tumble? Is that the trick?
notthetheft898,Damn bro that's pretty lucky
lioudrome,Careful : an exploded eagle ? The German comment squad is going to downvote this post
ItsBlare,Poor OP getting eaten alive by naked greasy wild reddiotors in their natural habitat
jfmherokiller,its stuff like this that makes me want to purchase this series of games.
,I find it weird the earlier games had better bullet cameras. The graphics are nicer now but the bullets and/or bodies glitch all the time in the last couple of sniper elite games.
MarcelVesp,*Plays Freak on leash*
Calphrick,"Ah, Liberation, the worst mission to 100%"
calmdownmyguy,LMAO
BigNugs0,deadpool type shit
tehdinozorz,Wanted Elite
Reveillark139,In this thread: a bunch of nerd losers nitpicking a fun video
ThighBiter1993,Guys I am positive this isn't splicing. It's more than likely a glitch
MyOhMyPancakes,"So from how I figured out it wasn't spliced, the bullet when from the statue or went under the wing and hit the roof, bounced off and headed for the shack in the field, bounces off of that directly towards the statue again."
ciuccio2000,Lmao Wanted final scene
TheDecoyOctopus,/r/GamePhysics
Response_Adventurous,"r/gaming showing it's true colours with these comments, damn you guys need some aerobics or shizz"
Preparing_to_die,Are these games fun? They have always looked appealing to me but I worried the game play would be shallow compared to the price tag
MilkItRalph,"There's definitely a splice there, the bullet hits the target, then goes back much further than it first started and went again, and on the second shot the tree in the lower right is missing - it's coming from a different angle."
Ill_Bee4868,Wait. There’s a Sniper Elite 5?!
Doctor_Eternal_65,That's some weird Wanted style trick shot! Good thing it was just an eagle and not Morgan Freeman!
werenotthestasi,"That should of earned you a trophy if I’m being honest. That was silky smooth and sexy as fuck

Edit: evidently some one thinks OP’s shot stinks…whatever I dig it"
Wild_Life_8865,Definitely two different clips
Lemur_H,Um.
BLT20,This is so obviously fake
Bilxor,"How is the bullet going up from ground level covering like a 50 foot vertical, then zooming through grass, then hitting something on top of a different building? Are we to believe this to be some sort of magic bullet? I hope someone got fired for that blunder."
Blackbirds21,You hit that guy!
wnfakind,Ooof op is getting beaten up here

Isaac_Serdwick,Please downvote this obvious fake.
Early_Permit_2072,It’s epic only when it end with a double on Hitler nuts.
dewback666,how do you communicate now?
EnderBoii266,What the hell
baron182,In some cultures that's considered treason /s
Trimere,I haven’t heard good reviews about this game. Do you like the gameplay vs the other previous games?
MenacingVillager69,Are the sniper elite series good?
Gahndor_Skaywalker,So was the target for this mission the eagle statue? I was expecting it to hit an NPC or player character. Seems odd for the target to be an eagle statue. Never played this game though.
screwplus,Looks like something I would see in a Steven Segal movie
PussyPussylicclicc,nice one
raven21633x,"OMG, how did I miss the release of SE5?  And almost a YEAR ago too!    


I'm working too damned hard."
morbihann,What exactly happens here ? Did the bullet got teleported to another location upon the first hit ?
Chemical_Coyote_4077,To birds one stone
Chemical_Coyote_4077,The first time I shot a guys nuts off in these games was amazed by the stuff u can do.
quberm,Weakest sniper from Ukraine
InternationalLow1159,Class shot
StalkMeNowCrazyLady,"In 05/06 an America's Army clan member of mine who was from Germany spend days sending me CoD 1 over mirc. Then taught me how use Daemon Tools to mount, install, and crack the game. Showed my local friend group how to do the same with Sniper Elite 1. I was a legend for that lol. Cut to me browsing frys, microcenter, and G4 for games to try. If they were good then go buy them. Never lost money on a bad game after that on PC."
nicholasthomson123,Nice shot.
arcademachin3,This looks super fun is it on steam?
Remytron83,"I think there were two eagles. The bullet went through the first and destroyed the second, which was meters away."
DEADLY_JOHN,What are you talking about!? I see no accident!
MuMbLe145,For some reason I was expecting the Adventure Time intro
larsgamer,Amazing
plutonium42,"There’s no way that happened! 

That was awesome"
matty6483,That isn't an accidental trickshot. It's just a glitch
faithful_watcher,For a second I thought it was edited.
dino9991,kewl
Playful_Resolution57,Bullet chose “I’m getting milk don’t expect me to be back” and actually came back

ClementngKR,"Hello, FBI? This guy just murdered an eagle"
DaddyKang,It’s like that final scene in wanted
agent_wolfe,This is very Korn.
avskyen,Tf this game looks great. Never judge a game by its completely basic name I guess
Literally_Pepe,I love watching bullet cams in Sniper Elite games.
Capital-Revolution96,Life flashes before you die. Same goes for the bullet lol.
MrFluffyhead80,"I didn’t see this happening, cool"
FrigidPredator,Yeah this looks totally real
HazardsOfGaming,My favorite part of fake clips like this is the OP frantically replying to every person who notices and collecting downvotes. Massive splice is massive
Finnmiller,How to farm negative comment karma 101
YeahItsRico,You can literally slow it down to see where he spliced the video
TeeBeeArr,Watch this frame by frame lol its clearly spliced.
,Sniper Elite 5 is an embarrassment.
Loki_Kore,"100% fake, bullet would gain a wobble after first hitting anything, and changes vertical trajectory and height at least 2 times. once at the first eagle where it teleports to 5 feet from the ground with a downward angle, again going into the house, where even if penetrated, was going directly into a hillside, and then changed to an upward trajectory."
2606gavin,"I think it’s two videos paste together, spliced and attached when the bullet goes through the ground."
Dankapedia420,Wheres the trickshot? All i see is a hardscope lol.
ANIKET_UPADHYAY,Looks edited. It went on top that windmill and then is flying across a field.
night4life,dude what?
xXTASERFACEXx,you can clearly see a cut in the video
Anavorn,This is how JFK's assassination went down.
Educational_Plane436,Spliced together from different areas fake as fuck
MrAlbinoBlackBear,"I mean.. weren't you aiming right at it? Accidental it is, I guess."
Alan_Scott_Davis,That’s a shot from One Piece. I’m sure of it
