datsadboi69,"I know the pain, It happens a lot more often than id like."
fubar87187,The title alone gets my upvote
Scavwithaslick,"Nice gun build tho, what is it"
SgtGinja,For what itâ€™s worth Iâ€™m sure the second guy you killed with the flashlight was also probably pissed about desync. He didnâ€™t start firing until a full second after you peeked. Probably didnâ€™t even show up on his screen until a millisecond before the server said he was dead. I hate peekers advantage in this game :(
Domeer42,He is just Boris the bullet dodger
CokedoutRicFlair,I feel like the servers have been having hit reg issues too recently. I started recording my raids cause I have the space on my computer and there are a few shots where a PMC or scav is perfectly lined up and it just misses. I understand the following shots have things like recoil and other factors playing into them but my first shot accuracy even while crouched shooting an unmoving enemy in the thorax is garbage for one reason or another this wipe and I have not had such issues in the past.
Zervoxer,"Honestly, penetrating shots aren't always updated immediately either hadn't it been for your high ping, you could just as easily have died to penetration of the barrels, those barrels are false security even prs will have straight penetration about 50% of the time through them and 20% or so chance for penetration with huge directional change, not to mention fragmentation chance."
FrogMonkee,"I wish so much that they would fix this but I seriously doubt they ever will at this point. It makes you appeciate how good the latency is in CS: GO, this shit would never happen."
Ferghast,This could ofc be desync but you can absolutely shoot through those barrels.
crocodilekyle55,"What ammo you shooting? First guy looked like he was eating, hard to tell if it was desync, stomach shots or bad ammo."
djn808,I can't even see the last guy you were shooting at
Jesterhead93,Is this supposed to be post worthy? This happens to me every play session lmao. Sorry for your loss though.
_inertia_creep_,"Probably someone using servers outside their region.  
Desync's like mad and unfortunately it tends to favour the higher pings.  
It bends reality. And of course, sub par servers and what seems to be inconsistent routing."
Dustin_Live,Safe to say the desync is at least a half second on this game.  It's fucking bad.  If you ever peak a corner you really have to commit or you'll die to desync anyways.
Captain_Cheesepuffs,Arenâ€™t those barrels wallbangable? Not saying it wasnâ€™t desync but it coulda just been a wall and right?
roswell411,"Why does it have to be the only shooter I like. Why does it have so many bugs , I wish I could enjoy any other shooter lmao"
Dobott,You can shoot through those barrels. I'm constantly in awe of what complaints rise to the top of this subreddit.
Asthemic,"You have high ping so what did you expect to happen here?

100ms ping alone is bad for pvp. There is a reason dial up (and even early cable) was bad and regular LAN parties existed."
xeres01,"This is why ive hung up this game for a while.  It has so much potential, but the negativity desync causes overrides most of the good experiences..."
techmagenta,Where was Dsync?
SageHamichi,I die like this daily.
bestadamire,6 tick servers
nubb3r,"Idk the tickrate in eft and idk too much about netcode, but I know itâ€˜s usually a tradeoff between having peekers advantage versus getting killed even though you were in cover already like in the clip. How can we have BOTH downsides of this design dilemma and quite bad cases too?!"
laaaabe,which AK is that?
y_a_e_t,Bro this kinda of thing and the whole peakerâ€™s advantage shit is getting really annoying lol
EbolaPepsiCola,"Those barrels are easily penetrated.  Although we didnâ€™t hear the audio of rounds hitting metal, that could be what happened."
Caine_Pain333,Someoneâ€™s never seen the movie wanted
awfeel,Any chance I could see the Al youâ€™re using ? For whatever reason Iâ€™m having a really hard time with AK recoil - is it 5.45? Or 7.62 - Iâ€™ve been exclusively avoiding 5.45 because I canâ€™t find one that comes close to say 556 at all
LyrukoF,"Same happened to me in factory, i made it behind the wall, so i tought and got head eyes a good second later"
Novel-Structure8660,i think you get killed from behind
-Stahl,Your ping hit 112 the moment you peeked. Super unlucky.
coolhwip420,This is basically every firefight for me though. I literally just died on reserve like this.
Haarmless,that is not even close to the worse desynch death I've seen
bland12,Worst Iâ€™ve seen this wipe yikes
Le-Misanthrope,"I have always experienced this going back like 5 or 6 wipes ago, however this wipe in paticular I have died more times when I'm already behind cover than I have seeing my enemy face to face. It's frustrating. I don't mind dying the moment I enter cover but I've had my guy drop dead or get shot after being in cover for a solid second."
unibomber24,That was some really nice tracking on the first guy!
SuperRektT,"I feel you

But a lot of this stuff happens when NA players play in EU and viceversa."
Donsen420,Since when is a barrel useful as hard cover? Doesn't look like desync because you can even hear the bullets hitting the metal.
Ishaboo,like as if that whole barrel covered you... cmon now.
Gawdsauce,"Summary:  
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.  
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).  
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.  
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because you were already dead."
AnotherBrock,Thatâ€™s a chad gun build
admins-are-garbage6,game is dogshit
Separate-Advance-453,Before the hot fix for the invisible stuff I had less issues with dsync and hit reg. since it dropped itâ€™s been awful and game performance has tanked also.
ZeroUnits,"I had some guy on factory black both of my legs and an arm before he even appeared on my screen, I managed to win it somehow but Jesus it pissed me off"
ranopan0,this happens on high ping servers and it keeps happening to me every time thats the case
Salamimann,"Just accept that this game sucks... My honeymoon phase was 2 years. Crazy how blind u can get.
Hope was big that everything will improve that's why i lurk but more and more hope is lost.
Game doesn't deserve attention anymore.
As soon as there is a comparable game people will run"
Brownlw657,What ammo did you die to? Cause Iâ€™ve been shot through those barrels a couple times.
Glum-Sheepherder-255,"Damn bro your tarkov looks amazing, are you playing in 4K and Ray tracing ?"
BiowarfareTTV,Games dog shit.
Katulobotomy,Those barrels don't stop most rounds.
heyjohnwyna,Had a situation yesterday where I jumped into factory office area first floor and my physical body was inside the office area through the door and I died to someone who was outside of the office area ground level  on my right side and it was head eyes. Dsync is so bad in this game.
Appropriate_Baker919,bros running like pp ammo wtf was ur hitcount ðŸ˜‚
Insanity8016,This is one of many reasons why this game might be in some serious trouble.
Deurikin,Def a skill issue
Rdtadmscksdnkydk,This game just doesn't look entertaining
Turbulent-Flan-8243,"Itâ€™s Lag, not desync. 
You are NEVER without a delay in online games.
Desync happens when someone is seeing something different than you. For example some crates is open for one player but closed for other.

You actually died here before going to cover, but you seen this information delayed. You didnâ€™t escape at all, It only hurted you in that way, that you thought you escaped for a moment. 

They guy with flashlight you killed have more right to complain than you."

Samu-ML,"happens all the time switched through all servers by now its the same everywhere, also cheaters every 2nd raid. Also if you cancel cms too late it will conume but not restore ur limb. Cheaters kill me with trash ammo through the best gear + propital now i am talking killa faceshield. its always top of the head 1 shot small ak....
The quest Bullshit is absolute trash aswell whats logic behind removing the flash drive when u kill a scav at least let me reset with it. The devs need to play their own game on public servers and get a feel for how bad this feels. Found in raid system also sucks i forgot so many good items in my container and they are worthless if u start a run with them. So much wrong with this game i only play it because of addiction."
ChefDud,You know the barrels there dont provide real cover for high caliber right?
Booyakasha_,And thats why you select servers under 100/150 ping.
Stickmeimdonut,"Why don't people realize, you are not dying because of desync. You are appearing to live because of desync. 

You were shot and killed fair and square while you were visible to the other player, you died server side and your dysnc to the server made it appear that you lived longer than you actually did. 

You didn't die as a result of desync, you just died.

Edit: Also you can shoot clean through those barrels if you have good pen ammo. (Not saying that's what happened here.)"
