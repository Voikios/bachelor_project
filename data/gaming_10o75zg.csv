Not because of the post itself, but because I‚Äôm right off the heels of being hurt by someone I love and every bit of this day seems to remind me of it more and more."

Zeyon,I remember seeing this around 10-ish years ago
Complete_Entry,"Is Mario meant to imply that the koopa troopa is doomed to die alone, and soon? If so, this is even more amazing.

He's just right there, waiting, slightly offscreen.

Not sure why I'm being downvoted."
RealRutz,Man fuck this today :(
Enemyofusall,I want to see his revenge arc.

O. T. T. O."
Chronocreeping,"There was a old guy at McDonald's who I'd see every now when I went on lunch and would eat with a picture with his wife. It was sweet but sad.

Cashier told me they both used to come and eat together once a week. I eventually quit my job at the grocery store nearby when covid hit. I can't help but wonder if he still goes there every week with her picture."

pHScale,The only way through is to kill the depressed koopa.
Wholesome_George,"DONT BE SAD!

I played this level years ago, and its a story level that ends happily.

C:"
Venrexx,"You know, how you perceive this is entirely based on how you choose to perceive this. If you want it to be sad, it will look like loss. If you want it to be happy, it can be anticipation for an upcoming date he's thinking about. As a funny third option, It can also be awkward, as he could be thinking about a date he just had, and how neither of them did anything the entire date but look at each other with blank expressions due to them having next to nothing in common."
Soca1ian,"Mario: ""itsa me, your S.O.'s murderer"""
imsosohappy,"I thought he was contemplating murder suicide, since the koopas in the thoughts are on those falling blocks."

SmilinBob82,Until you jump in to the koopa's dream and kill it's date.
PotentialCrazy1,Someone will get it.

DirefulArrears924,when you've had enough of green and need some red weird
friendly_investme427,I regret that it took me so long to realize what this implies.
mysteriouslygener403,"You know, how you interpret this depends totally on your choice of interpretation. It will appear like loss if you want it to be depressing. If you want it to be cheerful, it may be excitement for a future date he's considering. The third option, while is humorous, but also be awkward since he might be remembering a recent date on which neither of them did anything other than stare blankly at each other because they shared so little in common."
UnethicallyNervou128,I wish I was still able to play this.
