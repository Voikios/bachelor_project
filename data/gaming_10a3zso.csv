Independent_Plum2166,"I’ll give Big Boss this, if I discovered a friend of mine stole my DNA to create clones of me, two of which becoming thorns in my side in my lifelong goal, I don’t think I’d want to be a father."
Impurity41,"If the Nintendo videos are anything to go by, bowser does actually interact with his son in his free time and kidnaps peach because he wants his son to have a mom. Dude absolutely tries his best."
Arastmaus,Kiryu should be higher.
yaBoiCatLizzie,"""Nero is my son?""

""Yeah, dumbass. Can't remember through that thick skull of yours?""

&#x200B;

""You feel accepting yet?""

""Of your existence? Or your strength?""

""Both you fucking asshole!"""
Jackfly0114,The thing spy did when scout was dying def redeemed him a lot. If not he’d be where goku is.
MikBright,"Seeing Brad in the top left;

\+Crying

\+Depression"
BreachDomilian1218,Subject Delta singlehandedly should be moving Big Daddy to the top right corner or at least pretty fucking close.
Hbimajorv,There is definitively less Michael De Santa than I expected of this post.
Nearsighted_Madman,"""I just wanted you to be safe. I didn't want anyone to hurt you.""

""Brad... *you're the one who hurt me the most.""*"
LmaoGoFaster,Where’s Haytham Kenway
stiofan84,Kiryu needs to be closer to the top-right. Best video game dad.
invisibleshitpostgod,where sojiro
CAJ16,Lee in correct alignment.
positive_charging,I may be blind but I don't see John Marsdon on here
ursusowanie,"I would argue that spy actually did try. Sure, he never tells scout (his son) that he's his father, there's a big change he works in the same team as scout to make sure he's okay, even if he's not a small kid anymore. 

And even more, in expiration date even though they all thought they had only hours left of his life he didn't just sit down in his room doing whatever he loved most, he went out of his way to prepare scout for a date even though he wasn't forced to do anything. He might have been an asshole most of the times while doing it, but he clearly tried to teach his son and prepare him for the date, only forcing him to get a bit embarrassed with the intercom part. Also I'm pretty sure embarrassing the crap out of the student is a teaching style. Might not be the best, but it exists. I think that proves Spy actually tried sometimes and should be higher up."
Vainslayer13,"Vergil might deserve a pass. He was an utter prick to Nero, but genuinely didn't know he even had a kid until the last 15 minutes of DMC5."
Agreeable_Bee_7763,"In Vergil the deadbeat's defense, after the fight with Dante he asks ""So, he really is my son?"". I think he just didn't know. Pumped, dumped and only found the consequences when he needed a hand for something."
dolan2736,I guess jecht is offscreen further than heihachi
DV_Red,"Hades should be higher.
He really tried, he's just awful at it and couldn't tell his son about a whole load of stuff because he had to keep everything very, very secret.
I'm not saying he's the best, but he did try."
overlordmeow,"honestly, Lee deserves to be higher up. he was sooo *good* to Clem (depending on your choices). absolute 10/10 father figure right there."
faleli1851,I almost didn't see Heihachi there. Kazuya's probably below him too. The real devil gene in the Mishima line is the 'would make for bad dad' gene.
Zoantharian,GoW Kratos is very different from GoW Kratos.
freshairequalsducks,Kiryu not being higher is a crime
DrMrSirJr,"Much like in real life, my dad is missing from this"
iamDangelous,"There must be something wrong. I am not seeing SHAAAAAAAAAAAAUN or JASON, JASON, JASON, JASON"
FrequentSinger1661,How about King of All the Cosmos from Katamari Damacy?
Thelastdoggo,Chuck greene from dead rising would definitely be in the top right corner. Dude gets his daughter a freaking tiger as a gift.
Sir-Cellophane,"I would argue that Handsome Jack actually tried very, very hard. His efforts were in the wrong direction, but he was damn near obsessive in looking after his daughter."
EtheusRook,"I'd ask where Count Varley is, but we all know he's so far into Bad Dad that the chart can't contain him."
JakesBigPhone,Kratos’s daughter: “Dafuq?”
Alex0ux,Bro Vergil literally ripped his son's arm off
Comfortable_Help1872,"Ah, yes. Goku, the videogame character."
adjewcent,Master Splinter getting no love
yedyed,Love how good dads are all murderous sociopaths.
Deepdevil77,Ethan winters needs a spot
LassitudinalPosition,"I love that Heihachi is fucking off the chart

Hahaha"
LoudMutes,Jotaro seems a little low. Sure his daughter might have hated him at the start but he sacrificed everything to keep her safe.
UltraVires33,No Rost from Horizon: Zero Dawn? He'd definitely be in that upper-right quadrant.
MagicTheAlakazam,"David's a bit too close to the middle here.

I can see him being somewhat high on the ""tried his best"" scale but the step-dick was actively abusive to Chloe and constantly made her feel unsafe in her own home.

Probably should at least be to the left of Goku.

Edit: 300 comments and I think I'm the only one who wanted to talk about the Life is Strange character."
Megatics,Hojo would definitely be further than Heihachi.
yapper5013,lisa the painful is just heartbreaking.
HeaddHunterzz,"Kiryu should be maxed out good and effort, man will do anything for people dear to him."
Ejz09,I feel like Goku is not placed properly. He was only bad cause he had to save the planet and died a bunch lol.
mulsimin,Idk about goku. Man raised 2 kids and gave them  a whole forest as a house and saved the world like 10 times.
Geoclasm,Gau's (FFVI) father should be on this. Smack on the bottom left.
Eaglest2005,"Pokemon dads:

Like the only one that even actually interacts with you is Norman, and all he does is wail on you with slaking."
Cursed_String,John Marston?
CynicalDarkFox,"Goku did try though. Yeah he’s still an idiot (brain damage from a very young age), but does he not save the planet or act to help others when the time arises?

(- Raditz kidnapping his kid

- beating Vegeta [with help] even if he did let him go after

- Freeza after killing Vegeta, his childhood friend, wounding his former rival, and threatening to kill his kid next

- making things right after fucking up with Cell Senzu Bean when he threatened to blow up the planet

- Kid Buu since him trying to prepare everyone else to defend in his stead didn’t play out as he hoped 

- Beerus since he was there on a mission and would’ve blown up Earth if he didn’t get what he wanted)"
PhanThief95,"What about Sojiro Sakura from Persona 5? He was a great dad to 2 kids that weren’t even his!

Another bad dad would be BJ Blazkowicz’s dad from Wolfenstein 2. Incredibly racist, sold out his own son to the Nazis, & as a kid he made him shoot his dog!"
BaelZharon7,"I'll say it, Goku wasn't a terrible father. He loves his kids to death (literally).

Was his parenting the best? Absolutely not, but he did his best"
Xenoon_,In which way is gwyn a good dad? Didnt he literally force his son to be raised as a girl and then kill himself to ever so slightly prolong the legacy of his reign
Pyotr_WrangeI,Oh Heihachi has absolutely tried. Just not in the direction he maybe should have
ScratchyNadders,Ethan Winters absolutely got done dirty by not being on this list
Worried_Month1095,Surprise no one included ANY Player's Dad from the Pokemon Series
Gbrusse,The disrespect to Rost.
Fivefingerheist,But what about pressing X to Jason?
Garanas,OK but I’m even more curious to see where Ness’ Telephone dad places on the chart.
steelserenity,"I'd argue Kiryu tried his best, his best is just... not very good, lol. Especially because he's a walking target"
InstrumentalCore,Jotaro Lmao.
Bamma4,Where is Eli Vance!?
Kinglyfe2022,Seriously goku as a bad dad wow so clueless the man fished with his son on regular basis and he trained with him all the time. Then he died a few times saving the earth including his wife and sons.
minimeza,"There is a jojo game?
Not counting roblox"
Skalagrimson,Who is the dude at the top left?
FreyrPrime,"Goku got better as his kids got a bit older, but.. yeah.. It's a surprise his kids survived into adulthood."
PinkRonin11,Well goku never had the chance to be there for his kids! He was too busy fighting! Fighting or training. If he stopped training he and his family would be dead
RackTheRock,The reason DIO isnt in this chart is because he is such a bad dad he broke the chart
Iggy_dies,You should move jotaro up more he did actually try his best for jolyne
epic-gamer-911,Heihachi tried his best to be a bad dad if that counts for anything
RigtBart,Goku isn’t a bad dad. The memes have brain washed us into believing this trope. It’s not his fault he’s always dead or recovering from being mortally wounded and doesn’t have time for his kids. His kids love him and he loves them.
Decimus_of_the_VIII,"This is really twisted. In Dragonball you are seeing segments of the story during conflict. Goku and Gohan spent 2 years together in Isolation. 

Goku also spent as much time with Gohan as events allowed. For example he was: DEAD after fighting Raditz. You calling him an absent father for dying in service to saving the earth INCLUDING his son? Which was the main impetus for him to fight his brother in the first place. Notice Goku had no desire to fight him UNTIL Raditz kidnapped his son.

Second point. Goku raised Gohan with Chi Chi alone until 3 years later when he brings his new son to visit his old friends at a reunion. That means he neglected all social gatherings, to raise his son and be a good husband. Then the first thing he does on returning is to show his old pals his son. Obviously a proud and devoted parent. He then devotes all his time on Namek to defending his son, except when healing. 

As soon as he arrives who does he help? His Son, who may even be dying in this moment. Even after achieving a level of power unheard of on earth, his first thought on arrival was who? His Son. 

Once achieving apotheosis and becoming a Super Saiyanjin- who does Goku direct his thoughts to? Oh right, his son who he instructs to leave, as he can barely contain the rampant power coursing through his body.

Once Gohan escapes, Goku is then able to focus on the fight, and only then can he unleash his full strength to defeat the tyrant Frieza.

What does Goku then do? Spend the next year or 2 doing his utmost to return to earth, after having a barely functioning ship and crash landing on a strange planet. Did the Yardrat repair his ship? Likely, meaning he actually only picked up instant transmission because he had spare time while they fixed his ship. Once arriving home he spends the next 3 years once again with Chi Chi and Gohan, alongside Piccolo primarily, training together day in and day out. 

This means of the 11 years Gohan has been alive leading up to the Android menace, Goku has been absence a mere 2.5, and he was only absent those because of DEATH and circumstances outside of his control, such as GIVING HIS SON, SON GOHAN AND PICCOLO HIS SHIP on Namek. 

Finally we return to the next 2 years of Gohan's life in the time chamber. If we go with canonical sources it is one, however some speculate Gohan and Goku spent at least 2/3 of a day during their vacation week back in the time chamber, thus rhe terminology Teen Gohan (as he would need to be 13 to be a teen) for Gohan's fight with cell. 

That means for the first 13 or so years Goku spent 85% of Gohan's life together with him. Absent father? If we added up the time most corpos spend with their sons, something tells me Goku has them beat already.

Now after this Goku sacrifices himself in the fight against Cell. Many people blame him for having Gohan fight but so far in the series Goku has rarely been wrong about a fight, as an adult. He was right when he said he needed help against both Raditz and Vegeta, and also help with Frieza before transforming, which he admitted.

That means he was likely correct he could not beat cell, and he sacrificed himself so Gohan would actually end the fight with Cell in a victory, thus saving the earth. 

So you are going to blame Goku for missing very little of Gohan's adolescence due to saving the earth?

Goku was the best of Father's and this infantile dialogue that he was a bad dad is worrisome for the human race.

How many of you reading this had no father at all, yet cast judgement on the literal messiah of the DBZ universe?"
115_zombie_slayer,I am offended that Bowser is that low
Xbox,Just the bald top of the head and ring of spiked up hair peeking out from the lower left corner.
Squevis,"I was looking for the Tekken dad on the bottom left, and, sure enough, you did not disappoint."
Arge101,"Whilst he definitely tried his best in later years, Kratos did kill his daughter. Obviously the standards for ‘good dad’ are pretty low…"
Martholomeow,Geralt of Rivia is a dad?
