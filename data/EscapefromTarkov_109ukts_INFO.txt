They are like 50 durability but the max durability is still like 90+% sometimes this is sick. I got a kitted RPK of an ai scav. I\u2019m so hyped for this change\n\nEdit: guys I know scavs have had loot before. But nothing like this. Man I\u2019m finding AI scavs with full back packs of loot. Never seen anything like this before. It\u2019s awesome!\n\nEdit 2: the kitted RPK I found was off an AI scav on the long road on lighthouse like right in front of the town area. I don\u2019t think it was a raider. Also it was FiR.\n\nEdit 3: wow this kinda blew up lol. Also by kitted guns I don\u2019t mean that the scavs have like meta guns. These are drunk hobos guys.
