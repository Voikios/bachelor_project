malignoramus,good thing these two brave souls still voted in favor of removing her
Madhavaz,They're not wrong. But the stupidest votes have yet to come. Government shutdown here we come. And I bet those two cons will still vote with McCarthy.
GhettoChemist,">As they rode the elevator away from the House floor, congressional newspaper Roll Call reported that Foreign Affairs Committee GOP member **Ken Buck** and Republican Rep. **Mike Simpson** reflected on what had just transpired and decided it was a boneheaded move.
 
Say their names"
ramblinjd,"GOP: we don't want anti semites on committees

Also GOP: we wouldn't have so many natural disasters if it wasn't for the damn Jews and their top secret space lasers"
sugar_addict002,Republicans cannot stand up to their own.  How in the world would they ever stand up to a future Hitler?
Notysenberry-3116,">After Buck decreed it the ""stupidest"" political move, Simpson said the expulsion would probably make the Minnesota Democrat into a ""martyr."" 

... ""Stupid"" for all the wrong reasons"
osarusan,"GOP: ""Omar made repeated antisemitic and anti-American remarks""

Also GOP: ""Jewish space lasers are controlling the weather""

Also also GOP: actually participating in a seditious coup."
coberh,It's the stupidest thing *so far*. The Republicans can easily surpass this within the week.
sunnydaysahead2022,"There are no good Republicans left. 

They are all complete fascists and/or cowards who are supporting fascism through cowardice."
pattydickens,The stupidest vote was the one that gave them their seats in the first place. How anyone can vote Republican at this point is beyond my understanding. They don't represent their constituents.They represent the most reprehensible members of their party. I hope people wake up to the realization that there is no such thing as a moderate Republican anymore. The entire party is committed to extremism and the total destruction of the state.
Green-Snow-3971,"Did they vote for it anyway?

Yes?

Guess that makes you the ""stupidest lawmakers in the world."""
hamberdler,Didn't they later vote on something just saying socialism is stupid?
jarjarkinks4747,You have to be one dumb motherfucker to still  vote Republican.
WilHunting2,> GOP member Ken Buck and Republican Rep. Mike Simpson reflected on what had just transpired and decided it was a boneheaded move.
meatspace,"That's the most intense part about all of this:

At least half of the GOP knows the damage they are causing to the nation and does not believe much of what they claim publicly, and yet they are trapped. People with gay children have to denounce gay people etc. etc.

And very few of them will ever receive their financial reward for their fealty. And then the monster they are creating will consume them and their families along with the rest of us."
castle_grapeskull,So they don’t think it’s stupid because it was wrong they think it’s stupid because they are worried they made her a martyr.
TillThen96,">After airing their grievances, the pair reportedly asked those around them ""not to let leadership know their thoughts.""

lol.  The GOP is so bad, they can't talk openly even *amongst themselves*.  Who then, could possibly still believe they would talk openly to *their constituents*?"
kwilliker,"These people need to ponder on the implications of ""selling just a little bit of your soul.""  Cuz that's what they've done here.  Sure, it was a trivial thing.  Hardly matters at all in the grand scheme of things.  

But they've sacrificed a bit of their morals, ethics, and convictions in order to hold onto power within their party.  And tomorrow?  They get to sacrifice a bit more.

It's fun to say how Republicans *have* no morals or ethics, but I'm not convinced they start out that way.  I think they start by saying what they have to say to win their elections, even if they don't always agree with it.  That's step 1.  Then you have votes like this where they must go along to get along.  That's step 2.  

Step by step they trade what they believe is right for things they want.  And each step feels bad and they hate doing it.  Until eventually they don't feel that way anymore."
OrbeaSeven,Surely this solidified the Dem Minnesota vote. I'm Minnesota. Ilhan's got my vote next election.
PigFarmer1,"Way to stand up to McCarthy, you gutless wonders..."
Next-Home111,Buck and Simpson are the real heroes here.  AFTER they vote to oust her.  Fucking cowards.
hyperiongate,Republicans....children pretending to be adults.
Dear-Bandicoot7087,Imagine being this craven and pathetic.
Necessary_Row_4889,"“Oh, gee wiz, Old man McCarthy is going to be steamed if he finds out we are talking to you and won’t us let us go to the lock in at the rec center”"
icySlice_,They’re off to a hot start this congress with this vote and the vote to disavow socialism. Really tackling those issues that most people actually care about
KinkyBADom,"A pure retaliation vote. At least the vote to strip MTG and her cohort was made on principle after giving Kevin McCarthy the opportunity to discipline his members for their repeated violent, racist, and derogatory remarks."
platinum_toilet,"Article:

> As they rode the elevator away from the House floor, congressional newspaper Roll Call reported that Foreign Affairs Committee GOP member Ken Buck and Republican Rep. Mike Simpson reflected on what had just transpired and decided it was a boneheaded move.

It doesn't sound like the were ""caught"".   They weren't trying to hide themselves or their opinions."
LayerBoring,"Imagine taking an oath to represent the American people and going along with this clown show instead. Also, it would be nice if the media had any interest in what’s right instead of what will get them the most $$$"
SporkOfThor,the 'stupidest vote in the world' so far.  The Freedom Caucus has plans....
BeneficialDog22,Actual cult behavior
PUfelix85,"If they don't agree with the House Speaker, they could just ... Call for a vote of no confidence and cause chaos in the house again for another week or two.

Edit: As a matter of fact, I wonder if this is their plan for not passing the debt ceiling later."
ptcounterpt,"Seems like a lot of the newer (last 10 years) Republicans aren’t too familiar with the “optics” of the choices they make.  They play to their special constituencies: carrying guns through the metal detectors after mass shootings, making claims about Jewish space lasers, etc. but they’re not real savvy about how these choices look to normal people. Removing Omar is one such case. They can’t seem to wrap their heads around the idea that Americans aren’t all bat-shit-fucking-crazy conspiracy nuts. The media, especially Fox News works hard to spin this shit. They keep whipping it up as though we are evenly balanced and divided. We are not. In the next election cycle these wing-nuts will be history and they know it. Why else would they try everything under the sun, including open insurrection, to avoid free and open elections?"
FUMFVR,'This Kill All Democrats bill sure is dumb. Oh shit my mic is on. I mean let's kill all Democrats! Phew that was almost embarrassing.' - some Republican representative
UncommonSense26,Once again proving bigotry is a staple of the Republican Party.
Mysterious-Wasabi103,What I think is truly awful is how McCarthy said that Santos should still have committee assignments since after all he was elected by the people of his district to represent them in Congress. Yet they turn around and vote all these Democrats out of their committee assignments. The message there is so clear. You aren't allowed to represent people if you disagree. It's really sad how hatred runs the Republican party nowadays. Pathetic too.
trillabyte,"Stupidest thing ever…

Hell yeah I’m votin for that brother!!!!"
Cuck-In-Chief,"“Don’t let anyone know we made a factual statement!”

- Them, probably"
liililllllliilillill,"Omar is a great person to have on the Democratic side. Her just holding a seat in congress is enough to get Republicans to say and do the most awful, racist shit.

Many people forget that Donald Trump told her to “go back to your country”

After he said that Republicans stopped saying “name one racist thing Trump has said!”

They used to get so mad if you called Trump a racist. So many of them would be so confident that he wasn’t a racist. He got into politics by lying about Obama being born in Kenya, and started his campaign by claiming most Mexican immigrants are rapists and murderers."
Hobbgob1in,If the vote was stupid why the fuck did you vote for it?
sebileis,But they voted in favor of it anyway. Words mean nothing when your actions don't back it up.
GOPGUNLUv,1st day of black history month.. GOP is showing who they really are!
cribsaw,Cowards. This kind of cowardice is how you get a fascist takeover in the United States. What are they afraid of?
bailaoban,Correction: The stupidest vote the world *so far*
mymar101,She was removed because the GOP is bigoted and racist.
henryptung,"> The polarizing ouster only fell into place after McCarthy won over a handful of Republicans who had voiced objections to the effort — including Republican Reps. Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Victoria Spartz of Indiana — by promising to reform internal punishment procedures moving forward. 

My fuckin sides. I haven't seen Republicans indicate any ability to reform ethical procedures other than ""reform"" them to protect Republican members from punishment."
WillemDafoesHugeCock,">Foreign Affairs Committee GOP member Ken Buck and Republican Rep. Mike Simpson

Odd-Way-2167,"No courage. No convictions. These electeds are a joke. Cowards, one and all."
Sea_Dawgz,"It’s incredible what cowards these guys are. Vote for what’s right!

Remember when so many of them voted against impeachment bc they were afraid of threats from their constituents?

Pathetic."
Old-AF,But they voted for it anyway. No courage.
feignapathy,"All I know is, it is now fair game to remove anyone from any congressional committee based on Republicans' actions this week. 

They opened a door they should have left closed. They've degraded the institution of Congress yet again in the process."
Tenebrarum12,"In r/conservative they are delighted with this news because according to them you cannot criticize the jews or israel. Well, unless the Jews are shooting lasers at the United States, then that's fine."
prohb,"It was pure vindictiveness and conceit.  What a bunch of small, small people Republicans are ... especially McCarthy."
Chloe-s_mom2020,What does this say about the Republican Party?   Guess they don’t live by freedom of speech. I wonder why?
Mr_Mouthbreather,"Republicans lack of spine to buck their party is disgusting. There are always these rumors of these secret Republicans that are not happy with their party or with whatever bullshit culture war nonsense they are pushing, these secret Republicans never speak up, that is unless they are retiring and coming out with a book."

NsRhea,"We're not racist! says party that consistently passes rules and votes against minorities.

We don't hate women! says party that consistently votes against one of their own core beliefs of smaller government, just to put women in precarious situations against their will."
flamingus22,"I would appreciate this if the Republican party also went after Margery Taylor Greene. Unforturnately, they're pulling the ""antisemitism is only bad if it comes from the opposing party"" thing."
loveshercoffee,"Like she said in her speech, her voice is only going to be louder.

The GOP is evil but at least they're dumb."
david-writers,"No, the stupidest was voting against socialism, while the people who voted against socialism are paid via socialism."

MontEcola,Two republicans vote the party line and send their thoughts and prayers.
Areyoukiddingme2,"Well, they are right! I'm sure Democrats are more than happy to watch the Republican fall! Keep it up!"
Geezer__345,"In the meantime, virtually nothing is said about what Benjamin Netanyahu, and Company; are doing in Israel, and on the West Bank, and in Gaza.  ""Creeping Annexation"" of The West Bank, continues, and Gaza has been turned into a ""bombed-out"" hellhole.  I am not excusing Hamas, or The West Bank Government; but Menahem Begin described  the West Bank, as ""Judea and Samaria"", Benjamin Netanyahu has essentially followed suit; and installed a Hard-right Wing Party Member, as Defense Minister, while The United States Government turns a blind eye.  Netanyahu has also courted Saudi Arabian support.

Both Parties have actively courted Jewish, and Zionist Support; and campaign funding; and this is an example of the result.  Very few Americans know anything, of what is going on in the Middle East."
thisisntshakespeare,So Party over Country *again*. Just playing by the GOP playbook.
Nicenightforawalk01,"Spineless POS. They do this all the time and it works. Come out first against it then get persuaded by their leader to vote for it because of weak promises. 
After the vote happens then leak to the press their thoughts while their leader tramples all over the promises they told them. 
Cue outrage then disappear to the background"
Forensicscoach,And yet…they take the stupid vote.

flynn_dc,"At this point, because of Gerrymandering and Obscene Wealth Inequality, there are two kinds of Republican Lawmakers...those who actually believe MAGA bullshit and those who pretend to believe MAGA bullshit.  That is what happens in a fasscist environment."
WrongTie4601,That’s what happens when you go against the most sacred cow in U.S. politics. Israel
thebaron24,"The Republican party: constantly bitching and moaning about freedom and they aren't even free to think for themselves in their own party structure.

Let's be honest with ourselves. The only people propping this fascist shit show up are the ""centrists"" and ""independents"" who repeatedly vote for Republicans but know the party is shit so they avoid calling themselves Republicans. They go with some ""I'm a libertarian"" or some other bullshit excuse so they can hide behind platitudes and slogans without feeling like they are contributing to the downfall of this country but they believe every dumb thing Republicans say without question and repeat it.

I have a message to these people: don't vote for Republicans unless you want Nazis to run your schools. Don't vote for Republicans unless you want religion pushed down your throat. And don't give me that taxes are theft bullshit. You would be able to make a living without the infrastructure taxes built."
multisubcultural1,"You know what then? Stop being stupid and voting party over people you represent. If your best interest is preserving your political career, you’re not right for politics!"

not_SCROTUS,"Stupidest vote, *so far*."
Atralis,"Ken Buck is a pretty right wing congressman from Colorado but you can tell in a lot of interviews that he finds it insufferable to be lumped in with Boebert.  He is an old curmudgeon representing a area in eastern Colorado on the border with Kansas and Nebraska but the dude was also a lawyer that went to Princeton for his undergrad.

He isn't an idiot and he has to be considering his world as he watches conspiracy theorists, firebrands, and populists take over the party and win support in his own district out on the plains."
