PandaMuffin1,">  Hours after Middlebrooks' filing became public, Trump withdrew a lawsuit against New York Attorney General Letitia James that also happened to be before Middlebrooks. The judge had referenced the suit against James in his order on Thursday, noting it had ""all the telltale signs of being both vexatious and frivolous.""

Icing on the cake."
Dagonet_the_Motley,LOL imagine all the suckers who gave money to Trump only for him to spend it to pay Hillary's lawyers.
lufecaep,They should double it every time he tries to appeal it.
FortySixAndYou,"So, this is on top of the $1M in sanctions that were announced yesterday?    Cool."
Shattered_Visage,"Mmmmm, this is a delicious morsel. He is the most overly-sensitive little weirdo and you know this is going to absolutely enrage him.  


I wonder how r/Conservative reacts to this low-energy L he's taking."
byndrsn,it would have been a great addition if the judge made him hand deliver the check to her in person and apologize.
RicardoMultiball,"Rubes: you can expect more donation-seeking, ""America-First /Anti-Woke"" spam in the next few days.

Oh, no worries: they're not gonna use the donations to pay Hillary. But the *news* of the ruling is just too good of a money-maker to not spur an immediate cash-grab."
Mikesaidit36,"Also, good from the article:

‚ÄúHours after Middlebrooks' filing became public, Trump withdrew a lawsuit against New York Attorney General Letitia James that also happened to be before Middlebrooks. The judge had referenced the suit against James in his order on Thursday, noting it had ""all the telltale signs of being both vexatious and frivolous.""‚Äù"
Marathon2021,"Step 1:  Clinton attorneys send letter to DJT saying ""here's the judgement, we expect payment in 30 days.""

Step 2:  Trump puts letter in the shredder and pretends he can ignore it.

Step 3:  After 30 day window expires, Clinton attorneys file with Palm Beach County to put a judgement lien on Mar-A-Lago for the amount of $171,631 - plus interest at 18% per year.  Clinton doesn't get her money right away (or perhaps ever), but Trump has an absolute aneurism over the fact that Clinton has claimed a piece of MAL."
taez555,How much is that in NFT's?
workingtoward,So it costs even more to fuck with Hillary than it does with Stormy Daniels?
Scorpion1024,"Whatever else I can say about Hillary, she has been investigated up and down for years-and they did not find anything to charge her with. She sat in front of the senate and got questioned for hours-and made them all look like fools. She won all four debates with Cheeto Benito and quite handily. Whatever she is guilty of, whatever skeletons she has-it‚Äôs not what you all want it to be and if it hasn‚Äôt come out by now, it‚Äôs not going to. You won‚Äôt be seeing your fantasy if her in handcuffs."
Jump_Yossarian_,Karma. The orange turd bragged about Stormy Daniels being ordered to pay his legal fees and he has to pay double that to Hillary.
DirtyDeedsDunderKeep,"I've never been a big Hillary fan, but if she were to take this money, go on a vacation, and Instagram the crap out of it with a bunch of #ThanksDonald and stuff, I would be forced to re-evaluate my stance on Hillary Clinton."
geoffbowman,"If he runs again someone needs to run a smear ad that Trump has been ""stealing campaign contributions to cover legal fees... including paying almost $200,000 of supporter money to none other than Hilary Clinton"".

It'll make some MAGA heads explode."
PDXalreadtused,He pulled back his other lawsuit really quickly which makes this even more hilarious..
Zauberer-IMDB,"This is how much it cost to defend a frivolous lawsuit that got DISMISSED. No discovery, no trial, no nothing. And people want to know how corporations trample people's rights."
Thisisntmyaccount24,"I can‚Äôt wait to see this spin on this‚Ä¶ ‚Äúoh you trust Hillary? Even though she took $170k from known criminal Trump?‚Äù

Edit: corrected the spelling of Hillary"
OregonTripleBeam,I am sure a lot of far-right supporters are very confused by this news...
natebrune,That‚Äôs about 5¬¢ for every vote she got more than him.
Lolareyouforreal,"Taking donor money to give to Hillary, the libs must feel so owned right now."
OppositeDifference,"This is fairly trivial from the perspective of changing anything, however the knowledge that Trump will truly hate this and maybe even have a bit of emotional distress over it makes me happy."
dawgblogit,I wish they would add a punitive portion to this due to the egregious nature.
all_of_the_lightss,"His entire ""career"" has been exploiting the legal system with his army of weasel lawyers.

It's why his taxes took 10 years to finally get.

About time a judge told him that he deserves a penalty for tHe frivolous appeals and countersuits.

His cult won't care. They will defend him the rest of our lives"
Certain-Tough-6944,So much winning!
sugarlessdeathbear,"Pffft, good luck collecting. We know Trump doesn't pay legal fees to his OWN lawyer much less anyone else's."
BillMillerBBQ,Get ready for another round of Trump emails. PATRIOT! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP NEEDS YOU TO SHOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE AMERICA BY DONATING $48 TO THE DONALD TRUMP LOVES AMERICA CAMPAIGN! ONLY YOU CAN STOP THE WOKE LEFT AND SAVE AMERICA FROM COMMUNISM WITH YOUR SUPPORT!
perfectbebop,HRC should say she‚Äôll waive it if he admits he lost the 2020 elections ü§£
Substantial_Joke8624,He and his lawyers also have to pay nearly $1M for bringing a frivolous lawsuit.
weezer-hash-pipe,"You know he won't pay.

But the fact that he lost and it was ruled that he must pay HRC's legal fees must be pissing off the ex insurrectionist-in-chief really badly.

Oh to be a fly, vomitting on the ketchup on Trump's wall right now. :)"
Deja-Vuz,Good for her. She deserves everything. Fuck trump.
broniesnstuff,"""Make sure you sign it nice and big Donald."" - Hilary"
mytb38,"Hillery, please post the transaction for the world to see!"
xnolmtsx,"He hasn‚Äôt paid for some of his debate locations, Hillary‚Äôs gonna be waiting forever."
Busman123,He will never pay it. Clinton should keep us apprised of it's status.
CurrencyCommercial40,Trump's life would be a lot better if he could literally accept any loss lol
DontGetUpGentlemen,"Also in the judgement:

Although **obstruction of justice** is typically discussed in the context of criminal contempt, the concept informs the rules of law‚Äîboth substantive and procedural‚Äîthat have been devised to protect the courts and litigants (and therefore the public) from abusive litigation tactics. If use of an abusive tactic is deliberate and actually impedes the orderly litigation of the case, to-wit: obstructs justice, **the perpetrator could be cited for criminal contempt**."
FictionVent,Correction: Trumps‚Äô supporters will pay Hillary.  This makes it even more deliciously ironic.
sadandgladpp,It‚Äôs doubtful he could afford that.  Another bankruptcy?  Another bankruptcy.
turlian,I hope she frames that check.
AllPinkEvverything,Love this for herrr ‚ô•Ô∏è
Farttopower,"LOL

I say again:

LOL"
PrettiKinx,This is so hilarious. The guy keeps losing!
BoKnows8,Good for Hillary
captaincanada84,Every lawsuit he files is frivolous. He should be getting fined like this every single time.
lurkinganon12345,"Even with all of the losing this loser has done, something tells me losing to Hillary Clinton hurts him more than most."
LoganRoyKent,"‚ÄúBecause she‚Äôd be in jail.‚Äù

Lol. How‚Äôd that one work out for you, you Cheetoh fuck?"
nc1264,Calling him a loser is an understatement. He‚Äôs below trash. He‚Äôs the stuff you wipe your floor with knowing perfectly well it will never be clean. He‚Äôs a sad man.
TheINTL,Trump will try to pay that in Trump Steaks coupons
crazybehind,"That's shitty. Someone gets frivolously sued, you go through weeks of shit and uncertainty, and when the judge agrees it was all bullshit and never should have been filed, all you get is your lawyers bills evened up. 

There are more costs that aren't covered by such a judgement and you can argue about how to value them but they are real... Lost time, stress, diminished public reputation, lost opportunity cost of money."
eaunoway,"I mean I know it's a token amount and in all likelihood will never be paid but this has got to burn Trump *immensely*.

And that,  in turn,  makes me smile."
ninthtale,Can we get a mole to post this on r/Conservative pls
boston_shua,At what point does he get SLAPP status?
-flame-retardant-,I hope Hillary frames the check and hangs it on a wall in her bathroom.
whoknows234,"If this is what was meant by winning, I am still not sick of it."
fatFire_TA,Does she also get compensated for her time? I bet her billable hours are like $50k/hour given the speech circuit.
Merari01,A Trump never pays his debts.
Think-Gur3538,Lock him up!!!
Icyveins86,Lol good luck getting that money Hillary
Nixplosion,Hilldawg is gunna need to sue him in return to get him to pay it.
needanamegenarator,Lmfao. At least in this dystopia of late stage capitalism. We get shiny moments like this.
MR777,"It amazes me how he keeps getting lawyers to do this dirty work. No reasonable lawyer would file that claim according to the judge, that is absolutely damning. The lawyer seems to be a complete nutjob too."
Neighthianael,That's it?
LoneWolf4717,"Oh boy, I can't wait for a new round of NFT's to pay for legal fees"
sarcastroll,"And because he uses his campaign donations to pay his legal fees, that means his donors just paid Hillary."
_The_Great_Autismo_,But her emails!
mtnviewcansurvive,The one thing Trump hates more than the truth is being forced to pay
FictionVent,Slap suits don‚Äôt work against other rich people.  You would think the king of slap suits would‚Äôve learned this by now.
NachoBusiness,The problem? A Trump never pays his debts.
tbonerrevisited,"He'll never pay, hes a deadbeat"
batteriesincl,HILARIOUS!! His blood must be boiling!! üçøü§£
OGFahker,In cash and in person and we all get to watch.
freddie_merkury,Is he making Mexico pay for that too?
IllustriousAct28,This has got to have steam coming out of his ears even more than Stormy telling the world about his mushroom dick.
kaazir,It'd be nice if HE had to pay her but he's just going to dip into the funds he got from people's gullible family members.
BillLaswell404,What a loser.
bossbacon302,Awesome. I hope the rest of his days are facing the consequences for his thousands of lies
Damoclese420,Omg the GOP base has to give money to one their most hated candidates.
sm00thkillajones,Loser Donald loses again.
perpetual-dork,Not a drop in the ocean compared to all the money he is sucking out of his voters every month
DarkestRayne2388,Does he even have the money?
canon12,"The  more lawsuits against Trump the better.  He loves to steal, hide and use other's money.  It's payback time for this cretin. The only thing that means anything to him is money.  The best thing to happen to this disrespectful and dishonest thug are fines that would wipe him out and extended jail time.  Pay up LOSER!"
Cartographer0108,‚ÄúHa Ha‚Äù - Nelson Muntz
ObligatoryOption,What happens when he doesn't pay?
sherbodude,">Middlebrooks was nominated by president Bill Clinton on January 7, 1997

I'm sure the right will have a field day with this"
Final-Distribution97,Good

robonsTHEhood,ThAts gotta hurt
Zer0Infinity,Somebody call JG Wentworth.
windmill-tilting,"So, did Hillary win, did she trick him, or is she simply more powerful? Asking for a fiend...."
Geeber_The_Drooler,"We do realize that getting a judgement doesn't mean that judgement will be paid, right? And that trump is the MASTER of not paying judgements."
Relaxmf2022,Schadenfreude! Get yer red hot schadenfruede!
Gazeteer_gazer,This sparks joy.
PatrioticHotDog,"Hoping she donates it in his name to something he hates, like voting rights or Planned Parenthood or refugees."
Wine_Women_Song,"They better attach a schedule of increasing, and means of collection, for when he doesn‚Äôt pay. 

Is Mar-A-Lago solvent?
If so, better just sign it over to her."
rguerin8,Love it!  But good luck collecting
Samurai_gaijin,"""Pay ~~lock~~ her ~~up~~ bills, pay ~~lock~~ her ~~up~~ bills!"""
helptheplanet,She should donate the money to a trans charity.
doodoometoo,"""These are better than money, sir. These are IOU's."""
helptheplanet,The money will be paid by donaters. Trump loves idiots that donate to him or any of his causes. The money all goes to Trump. Hilarious.
derfmai,She should seize the right side engine on his private plane.  It probably has sufficient value to cover the cost and at the same time she gets to disable the ‚Äúright wing‚Äù permanently.
noodlelein,PutiNs pup-pet
Airdropwatermelon,Lmfao. Love that for him.
cwn01,Lock him up! Lock him up!
Ucla_The_Mok,"Unbelievable.

Trump's still ahead $128,369 once he collects his winnings from Stormy Daniels.

Complete-Okra-4588,Could‚Äôve paid off 1.3 porn stars for that
WallabyBubbly,$1 million in total fines isn't much of a punishment for a guy whose supporters donated $250M to his fraudulent election integrity fund. He needs some Alex Jones-level fines
Wasteland_Mystic,God damn that is a satisfying headline.
