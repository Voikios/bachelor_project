thetrickypickle,Any advice for starting some thing like this?
coding_ape,Can you explain the hyper tube stuff? Do multiple entrances increase the speed of the tube?
jim_the-gun-guy,Very nice. I really need to stop building willy Billy and build a legit factory on my new save.
Pakspul,Looking good!! What is the factory creating?
NonEuclideanSyntax,Really solid work.i look forward to seeing your next build!
pat__pix,Nice work.
Delroy1989,Looks awesome bro üëå üòç
romo7000,This is impressive
crea31851,Nice!
stoneseef,This is a great factory!!
thegroundbelowme,"Looks really fantastic, this is the kind of design (asymmetrical, realistic) that I struggle to achieve. Especially love the ceiling on that train entrance."
Orchai28,"The lag has to be real, nice build."
Kaylinn83,Looks good! Like the colourscheme!
Gunk_Olgidar,Nice looking factory!
SheepDogCO,Impressive!
jkay2,That‚Äôs lookin‚Äô great
themarknessmonster,"Well damn, Pioneer!  This is exceptional work.  FICSIT is sure to be as proud of this as you are, and so am I."
Sunkysanic,"This is so awesome dude. A couple questions I had, sorry if I missed them:

What are you doing for storage? Or are you outputting things to go to other plants?

How many hours do you think this build took you?"
ak74madman,I‚Äôm on my first ever save 17 hours in (loving the game) with nothing but spaghetti I‚Äôll get there one day
CNC_er,How many IRL watts does that factory consume? Just curious.
outerspacemannn,WOW. Mind blown
Triggerunhappy,Your factory looks like it‚Äôs moments away from being raided by GI JOE
Personal_Ad9690,How do you get shiny floors?
NewEdgeMan,"I‚Äôm not even going to show my first factory or my 100th factory because they are sad compared to this. Some people just have natural talent, I‚Äôm more of a function over beauty guy"
Maleficent-Ad7827,I just bought it but I‚Äôm hesitant to start. I really enjoy playing space engineers and I mostly spend my days at work planning my night in my save and it‚Äôs become quite comforting after a long day. Is it worth to spend the time and get deep into the game?
DucksAreFree,That's beautiful! You did a wonderful job.
JellyfishUnable,I love the train coming through the pillars here
Capnris,"I promise the color scheme did not remind me of Shadow the Hedgehog. Not even once.

Seriously though, looks really nice."
DavosAbides,"As a new player, I don‚Äôt know exactly what I‚Äôm looking at, but it‚Äôs absolutely aesthetic."
wivaca,"None of mine look this good.  Most of mine end up being boxes with a lot of glass.  I really need to work on points for style like you have here.  

Nice work!"
Danominator,Oh yeah? You should see my hodge-podge factory sitting on the forest floor
python_artist,It looks amazing
Nexaz,Well this puts my current project area to shame‚Ä¶
xXAnoHitoXx,"Good! Now make another one!
- Ficsit management"
Xsilverpheonixx,What mods do you use for the reflective lighting. Looks sick.
Luvernar,Do you have a RTX?
VeryPickyPenguin,This is incredible
Treacle_Individual,"Looks good, if you decide later to change it or tear it down always make a save and use that for new projects in case of mistakes or to reflect back.

P.S do you plan on building a megafactory everything in one place factory :-)"
DeutschKMN,"Beautiful design overall! Looks like a ton of work went into it! May i ask what is built in the factory, and what are the material on those Hallway outside walls? Never seen that before."
