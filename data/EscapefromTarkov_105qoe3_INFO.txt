It's so god damn cringe that a big fuckin' PMC can hear me while he's SPRINTING around on metal and wood, but I am somehow so loud that he picks me out through all that loud ass noise. It makes no sense. \n\nI've been playing Tarkov for way too many wipes now, and I remember in the past being able to sneak around 100% quietly. I'm not asking for a return to that level of quiet, but the current state of things is so broken that you either have to hope you find a clueless dumbass or have to pick a spot and camp it. I might be carebear and a whiny boye, but I'm not gonna resort to camping just to get kills.. please allow us to sneak more quietly BSG.. thanks.", "ID": "105qoe3", "Score": 1100, "Total Comments": 312, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/105qoe3/please_allow_us_to_sneak_quietly_again/"}
