Sabbathius,"Yeah, Cyberpunk and Metro Exodus are just gorgeous with all the ray tracing and bells and whistles on."
flshift,"The only thing that looks bad in cyberpunk on max graphics is water

And some npcs eating hexaconigal burgers"
reggie_morris,"I bought it when it first came out, with all the bugs and everything. Still I was amazed with some of the views in the game. Just looks stunning"
Rumit_OP,"""I really want to stay at your house"""
rtz13th,"I'm not sure about you, but to me it always looks stunning"
Manticore1023,"My favorite part of the game was the fact that you could just walk around like a regular jagoff pedestrian and it felt like a real city.  It's one of my all-time favorite games, warts and all, and I need to do a 3rd playthrough with mods once the DLC comes out."
Vampiricbongos,Anyone else think that neon sign said poo?
Babu_the_Ocelot,I'm so glad I never read anything about the game/got into the hype before it dropped. I bought it on release and thought it was brilliant. Great story and insanely pretty.
dandroid126,"I recently moved into a house where I have a game room. I don't have it all set up yet, so my desktop PC is kind of just sitting around, and I'm playing older games on my laptop in the meantime. This game is really high on my list when we get our couch delivered and the room gets all set up."
arcax2004,"I am really into buying the game, should I?"
SnooOranges1918,"The Johnny storyline is actually pretty good if you play it all the way through. Don't forget to ride the roller coaster with him. You have to fix the roller coaster first though.
Yes, the visuals are amazing in the game. They did a terrific job on the visual art."
flux_capacitor3,I just started this game after finishing The Witcher.
Estoye,I can't believe that thing plays on a Steam Deck so smoothly.
kyzer-ix,stunning!!
Josh_Butterballs,"Oh god, mentioning cyberpunk on r/gaming? 

*grabs popcorn*"
Netsuko,“Sometimes” ? Cyberpunk is one of the most gorgeous games out there right now.
Mushroomman6677,Is it finally worth playing now? I remember the story being fun for awhile but the free roam and everything else was just boring.
Butterscotch_222,I think the 200 year old sports car is what really makes it put one of the fancy cyberpunk future cars and the picture would have a totally different vibe
TheOneReborn69,The driving is so bad
One-Tank6089,"I think so too, it is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played."
Rosstin316,Still shots of Cyberpunk and videos of Cyberpunk are like the “selfie vs. tagged photo” thing.
ButWhatIfItQueffed,"Despite the bugs, and the horrible launch, Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best games of recent time. Partially because A) The devs actually bothered to fix it because they care about the game and even pulled it off the Xbox and Playstation store so that way they could fix it and re-launch it. They didn't have to do that. They could've just left it up there and for people to buy a clearly broken and way to early release game. But they didn't. And B) The story. The story is AMAZING. It's so fucking good. The characters are actually human, with emotions, flaws, opinions and biases, and an actual personality. I haven't seen that in so long in modern games. Most modern AAA RPG characters are just ""Hero main character type"", ""Sidekick"", ""Disposable 3rd character"", and ""Funny companion"". Usually with very little depth or imagination. But the characters in Cyberpunk are so well written. And the atmosphere and world building is just incredible. Everything is so well put together, at least on the plot side. And the graphics, oh my lord the graphics. I know it doesn't run well at everything, but if you have the ability to crank the graphics it is one of the most beautiful games of all time. It runs like shit, but on a laptop 3060 and heavy use of DLSS i can get it up to ultra 40-ish FPS. And like I said, it's stunning. The ray tracing is amazing. It's on my top 3 games of all time, up with GTA 5 and Watch Dogs 2. I know that it's still extremely buggy and kind of a mess, but it is such an amazing game either way."
BoredGorilla21,"Game looks great in photos. As soon as you move in any direction or attempt to interact with the world, the illusion immediately cracks. It’s beautiful, yet hollow and broken all at the same time. My 2 cents anyways"
Ima_Fuck_Yo_Butt,It's been a couple months since I've played. Mostly since I got VR. Is there a Porsche/Singer update or something?
BlindestofMonks,"Great concept, saddly subpar execution :|"
fxrky,"..... sometimes? It's a fucking marvel of technology lmao.

If the marketing campaign didn't exists you'd all be calling the game high art ffs lol.

Throw the entire game out the window, and treat it as a pretty walking simulator, and I'll still play it over almost every AAA game that dropped in the last 3 years."
__BigBoi__,It's my favorite game for a reason
CiriLOVESGeralt,Sometimes?
Quirky_Ad7770,"Cyberpunk sometimes looks stunning, if you have a pc powerful enough to kill god"
Akumetsu33,"I've noticed there seem to be a moderate amount of posts pushing people to play cyberpunk, and all of their titles sound similar ""Cyberpunk's better now, buy, buy!"" Along with top comments saying ""Should I buy the game?"" veiled as a innocent question.

Know why I think it's odd? You don't see this with most other games because they don't need to convince you. Only the desperate ones do. 

I suggest wait until a massive discount to buy it, don't even bother until then."
mupheminsani,"Dude this game looked so good, wish it had the right content to go along with..."
pirate135246,"Looks great, story is good, gameplay is janky and kinda boring"
beidao23,I've learned the hard way that CP77 is best played through screen shots on Reddit
averm27,"I honestly just can't get into this game. I've tried it, but man it's boring.

The game has a boring story, made it around 40% in, before I gave up.

(This is the Xbox series x updated version)."
ss977,It's like wooooow when you look but knowing that only like 5% of those actually exist in game to provide that cyberpunk world experience was a little disappointing. Resource limitations and all that but yeah..
Basswachter,"Honestly, this is one of two games where I try my best to avoid fast travel. The other one is Morrowind."
X-xOtakux-X,Don’t let this distract you people from the fact that it still isn’t worth the price tag
OldAssPirate,"Night City does look pretty sweet at times, but I'd rather be out in the desert with the Aldacaldos. I like the quiet and darkness."
RollerCoasterPilot,"Keyword being ""sometimes"""
NasoLittle,What a Labor of Love
Jsamue,It’s the prettiest slideshow I’ve ever finished
MaoWasaLoser,"The graphics and world building were not the problem with Cyberpunk.

It's a gorgeous looking game and Night City is cool as hell, but the problem is there's like nothing to do in Night City.

I say this as someone with about 100 hours in the game on a couple of characters. I clearly enjoy it. I just wish there was more to it."
NinjaDogzz,"Visuals are amazing, but the game needs mods for me not to bang my head into a wall while driving."
tills1993,"Next slide, please, computer.

Full disclaimer: I have 100% completion on Series X and aside from that one market the performance was incredible and it was stunning through and through."
Griffolion,"I think CDPR nailed the aesthetic of cyberpunk. But the city itself felt so empty, and small. The city is hugely vertical but you're relegated to exploring almost all of it at ground level. Certain megabuildings have accessible parts but that's very limited."
Available-Moose-1408,I just can't get over the fact that it just feels so empty it has looks but zero soul.
Alchompski89,Yes but it's boring sadly.
rikashiku,"It's definitely one of the best looking games that I've played in recent time. Even in the middle of a battle, I'm still blown away at the quality of the visuals. Especially compared to other games I played around this time, this one was still the best looking game I had seen, and honestly, it's also very fun even in the first couple of months of its release."
x33storm,"Just needs that text in the corner saying ""4 FPS"""
RafaelRoriz,You shouldnt post about cyberpunk here. This sub hates the game with passion.
animebuttholesniffer,boring ray tracing neon light slop
hecatonchires266,"Yeah, on ultra settings and only possible of one has the card to achieve this."
Puppystomper420,People play this game? I refunded that shit fast!
Mutjny,"This game looks so good and the world is phenomenal its a shame a botched launch is preventing us from seeing more and being more in it, but thankfully Edgerunners did a lot to pull it back from the brink."
clete-sensei,Best worst game ever
Zangrieff,Never looks like that when i turn on max settings
wiyjey,How in 20 years we have achieved this from pixel games...
SayCheeseBaby,"If we're talking looks alone, it's a lot more than sometimes for me."
,I want this car in real Life so bad
Swordbreaker925,“Sometimes”?
spidermanngp,I played this game solely at night unless the mission required daytime. The second the sun rose I time-skipped back to 10pm.
DanStudd90,"I am playing Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5 and while there are still a few bugs and glitches, it has affected my overall enjoyment of the game. As long as you accept that the game still isn't technically perfect, I highly recommend this game now as long as you play on PS5, Xbox Series X, or PC."
stlx359,"I loved the game, but didn't get a beefy GPU when I completed it. I've got 6800xt now, cranked all settings to the max (including ray tracing) and it doesn't look stunning to me. Does it look good mostly at night or is it because I'm still on 1080p?"
KingOfFights,What's with the Below Deck lol?
NegativeCow5385,How do you get the Porsche in cyberpunk?
MightyGonzou,Most of the time you mean
Ph4ntomiD,What do you mean by sometimes
Golden_Axes,POO
luckytraptkillt,The city always looks sick. The outskirts I need to go explore some more. I’m sure there’s tons of cool shit out there.
nohumanape,"""Sometimes""? More like, often."
iflysubmarines,How many mods you got on that bad boy
Any-Analysis-9189,"Me ; Cyberpunk Look stunning

My wallet Don't even think about new graphics card."
xSantenoturtlex,At first glance I thought this was a picture taken in real life and that this was a post talking about some weird looking new car model. Holy shit.
nighthawkinX3drop,"I played cyberpunk recently, and despite the way the game runs the game looks absolutely incredible."
Redditadminpedos666,Now if only games could rely solely on looks. If the game ran as well as it looked it would be amazing. But as it stands it's a good looking dead world with little to no interaction with it.
C-A-L-E-V-I-S,I need to give this game another shot. I really dislike the feel in First person. I’m not sure the mechanics are good enough to warrant it. Third person would’ve felt better for this one IMO
2FANeedsRecoveryMode,I wish need for speed games had this kinda graphics
ur_moms_a_stripper,Try last gen
CPTPH4NTOM,"I like the graphics, it's one of the most beautiful game but the game still stutters and lags a lot. The only reason I don't like it much."
Kudoakainu,It always looks stunning
theMobileMike,I like Cyberpunk more than most Bethesda RPGs but to each’s own.
hvanderw,Animations are great too. Awesome models and animations are amazing.
Analog_Astronaut,Mostly? It almost always looks stunning. (on pc).
StellarSloth,Got this as a Christmas present but haven’t installed it yet. Is this screenshot the regular game with the settings cranked up? Or are graphical mods installed too?
Automatic-Tomato9449,... Just sometimes?
Wise_Writing,"Swap ""sometimes"" with ""often"""
800009654,Not on console
Axemic,"I have it. Got PS5, now I'll start it up, because on PS4 pro at first it was unplayable..

How lomg is the game?"
Initial_Welcome9052,Personally I give the story and artwork an A+.  There’s a little jankiness to the gameplay but I don’t think it takes too much away.
_NiohZA,Ace Combat 7 also looks amazing when you fly through the clouds etc
fnesse,"it looks fucking amazing

its just that with all those amazing graphics and visuals, they failed to make the game feel ""alive""

cyberpunk looking amazing was never an issue even from the beginning, it was just the bugs and the fact that it just falls very short of making it feel more immersive when it comes to just free roaming, like how they did with The Witcher, when i played that game i found myself just running around doing whatever i came across and it was fucking amazing same with RDR2"
pepetlover,can u actually up close to those signs and into the buildings?
NormalPrint1739,The visuals are jaw dropping but sadly most of the environments have little to no interactivity.
rydum,It always looks stunning
ex-ALT,"I played day one on 1660ti at 1440p, and I thought it looked pretty damn decent. Sure wasnt the best graphics but good art style imo.
Maxed out it looks sick asf."
Wordfan,"Is the gameplay any good?  I tend to not like shooters because I play on console and I just don’t find aiming with the right stick very responsive or satisfying.  I’ve gotten a little better at it from playing so much God of War, but it’s better as a supplement to melee.  Still, there have been a few exceptions.  RDR1 was a blast."
ceacar,"Don't forget mods. 
The flying car is so good. 
Also the drone companion is nice but seems buggy. My mecha army can't attack."
Mario_Vishal,My only complaint after bugs was I expected we could drive those floating cars that would be so cool
BeebleDoof,"Played at launch, got annoyed. Started a replay last week and I can't put it down.

Stay cool, choom."
REiiGN,"So I've just started playing the crap out of this.  Played all the side quests and just finished the main story.   


Great stories, fun side missions which are mini stories themselves and some will add to the main story. 

Some of the weapons are cool, how you can either do stealth or Rambo is neat.  The cyberhacking is pretty involved and fun to watch. 

Locations look great but the people walking around act bland and don't react much to you at all.  However, and I play on PC but the city can get full of people so it has that going for it.  Committing crime is GTA-ish to an extent.  Accidentally hit a pedestrian, 1 star.  Got shot at by drones, destroyed them 2 stars.  Then cops came, shot them and then 4 stars.  They then sent netrunners,  killed them and then nothing.  Stars went away and that was that.  Thought that was pretty weird coming from ""you will absolutely die, 5 star GTA""."
streetsofkage,Cyberpunk sometimes actually looks like a cyberpunk game
Buscandomiyagi,I love going back and walking around or driving and just getting lost in the environment.
yunikornio,I couldn't wait for you to come clear the cupboards…
LavenderDay3544,It's has some of the best graphics of any game ever made both with and without RT.
standarsh50,It was good but that car drove like shit
PilgrimsPlague,"Wish my game looked like this, the badlands all blind me lol"
Dragon_yum,And sometimes your car starts flying when you hit the pavement.
4M1R98,"Can't wait for the PS5 update

Then ill actually buy the game because it needs at least one more patch"
JustShibzThings,"I thought I'd seen it all, until I played in VR and it's honestly the best thing I've seen in gaming...

I have a few recent posts about it..."
Runnin_Mike,"Regardless of what you think of the game, I think it as an urban futuristic, densely populated city, open world game was really one of the first of its kind to this scale. You can still be impressed by this regardless of your opinion of the actual product. Not talking about OP just general opinions of the game. I enjoyed my time with the game almost exclusively because of the world it put in front of us. The gameplay was secondary, almost even tertiary to this.

I want more cyberpunk genre games in the world. It's coverage in modern entertainment is minimal, for a long time I just had to pick up cyberpunk novels to explore the genre, I want to supplement those novels with visuals now, and I hope cyberpunk opens the gates for this, regardless of the criticism. A fully realized Shadowrun world would be a dream come true too."
SanctuaryMoon,All the lights really pop. Way more than any other game I've played.
pixlbabble,My pc is showing it's age with this game OG build from 2009 but got 16g ram and a gtx1060. Got it playable tho.
lazergator,I’m patient gaming this one. Once it’s lifecycle ends it’ll be a fantastic game but it was too ambitious for launch
plumppshady,Sometimes? I mostly walked everywhere this game was so beautiful.
TheVoid45,Totally not me wishing I wasn't stuck with an old laptop that can't run the game
turapuru,Did you mean everytime?
NatureValleyIsDry,This is my favorite game for screen pics. The atmosphere is always stunning
TinoCartier,Next on my list after I finish GOWR
Mr_Bubblemer,"Well, the game's best atreibute is looking damn good ... wxcept when you or a random NPC is clipping through a wall or floor or flying away just cause the game had to sneeze."
s1mpatic0,Always*
humjaba,I wish I could get into this game- I’m just not into all the upgrade paths. It’s too much like work. Just let me shoot and drive stuff and enjoy the story.
Katana_sized_banana,"It will be a long time before any game comes close to Cyberpunk 2077's Night City. People forget how big and dense this map is, how many buildings and roads. Yeah GTA hat the better wanted system for police chases, but it's an empty cardboard city compared to Night City. We'll see if the next GTA comes close, it'll probably be fantastic but will it be that vertical or more flat?"
not_old_redditor,When does it not?
BeefSerious,"It looks good even with this terrible ""screen shot"""
