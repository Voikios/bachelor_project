ConcreteCobbler,Why?!
alextestsatis,"When finished we will have placed 6250 Power Storage Units with a Blueprint.
We will need 625.000 Wire - delivered by Train.
62.500 Modular Frames and 31.250 Stators."
G0t7,"Would be funny if batteries or machinery could malfunction and catch fire. 

First thing I thought was this would be impossible to extinguish, if these were real lithium batteries.

I don't know if such disasters would fit in the game, but I think it would be a very interesting gameplay addition to plan in safety measurements like a sprinkler-system or drones to extinguish and repair parts of a factory. 

Then we would have an actual reason to build batteries as a backup System. lol

Did Coffeestain ever talk about something similar, and what are your opinions about this?"
OddfellowJacksonRedo,Yeah now that we have Battery Storage I definitely am planning on at least one massive Backup Plant. It’ll take quite a while to charge but anything beats never having to hear the dreaded shutdown fuse noise again.
Plonka48,I really hope there is just one tiny cable coming out of the building
Gurudia,"Electric lasagna, yum!"
cozmokittylord,This is going to take longer to charge than its going to take for satisfactory to be out of early access
Selisch,MWh*
gaudierlace8824,Thank god for blue pronts
ryan8613,Blueprints to the rescue!
eee170,"We do what we must because we can


Aperture science-"
sci-goo,Elon Musk: I want those in my cars.
SheepDogCO,Does this mean you produce 625 MW of power?
vincent51797,I'm working on a 9k coal plant and thus us going in right after. I do 3-5 times my production . I call or a world battery.
Electric_Bagpipes,1.21 Jigawatts
Mayinator,And I thought my 60 000MW was excessive :D
Dog-5,I would die trying to create so many stators since I don’t have a storage for them
AceScottieAC3,Please style this building like a car battery :D
Immediate_Title9891,Go for 1 GW. Listen to the voices. Do it.
Lasiurus2,"Man and here I thought my world with 112,500 MWHs of power storage was overkill."
PineappleGirl_5,"Seeing as you probably like building huge factories, how long will this actually last if for some reason all your power generation stoped?"
Pit_Full_of_Bananas,Just in case
