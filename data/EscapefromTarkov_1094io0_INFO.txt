{"Title": "We all asked for a longer mid wipe - now we're getting it", "Post Text": "I know that the complaint threads don't necessarily represent all of the player base but BSG is listening to requests to extend mid game. I for one, LOVE that high tier ammo, armor etc is all getting put to FIR only or LL4. Yes you can argue it just moves the meta left but it's still a great step in the right direction. Yes, tarkov is has issues (looking at you audio), but after quitting very early into last wipe, I'm very much looking forward to a more balanced mid wipe this time.
