Prestigious_End_2436,"No, normally you'd do all that and get 1 tapped by the scav. This is actually a solid outcome."
Joren67,Normal? No. Normal in Tarkov? Yes.
Seralth,"Among what everyone else has said, since you new you should also be aware that while you the player have 440 hp.

Scavs have various levels of hp up to 740 

Head: 40

Thorax:150

Stomach: 150

Arms: 100 each

Legs: 100 each

Total: 740

Which means your shotgun could take two or three shots to black the arms to actually start doing any real damage if they have even shit armor on. While on a PMC one shot would be all it takes."
operation_hamster,"Depends on ammo and armour. You shot the chest where the armour protects.

I agree that the arms should have get hurt. Also I agree that there should be some impact. I guess nobody keeps walking after getting hit by a shotgun."
ShapesAndStuff,"Besides the ammo/armour topic people have brought up repeatedly:    
The Remington sucks ass. PMC is unable to line it up quickly so it shoots god knows where if you fire rapidly. i think low left, but i might be wrong.  

If you look at the rear sight, the front sight post is nowhere to be seen after the first shot. On the second to last shot you take some time and you can see the gun pivoting slooooowly from the bottom left back to center."
Joie116,One headshot will fix this issue
Ok_Faithlessness9724,Welcome to tarkov you’ll hate it here
ItDolph,"Summary:  
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.  
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).  
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.  
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because you were already dead."
EDOTONY,Uninstalling the game is also normal
Shot-Implement-9452,"Its called, ""This game is in beta for 10 years"""
Moforia,This is exactly why I stopped playing this stupid game.
HAAAGAY,Yes shits been broken for years
Bunchiebo,"Sadly yes, for shotguns early game your 2 big options are 7mm and Magnum buck to try and avoid that but you can never really run away from a tarkov moment like that one, sometimes they were just never ment to die, like nikida himself is giving his blessings to the enemy"
Aj_bary,Yes
Bukkake-Blast,Yes
VidraiderBros,No .... But yes
buckets-_-,"No.

You survived lmao."
Mightypeon-1Tapss,"You are spreading the damage on multiple body parts hence him taking so many shots, try to aim for the head or leg/stomach and avoid thorax/arms at most times with shotgun"
preyforkevin,That shotgun is the worst.
ChocolateCavatappi,"First 4 shots missed, 5th hit the arm, 6th missed, 7th killed."
Bleggman,"you were missing him, seriously"
Lordjaponas,1 bullet hit the face and scav will die
Kerofenlik,This is not a game. This is a dev version of future game. And you are not a player here :)
minusunu,you shot that guy in the penis
thebabyslayer,realism btw
BitterQuitter11,I hit ine yesterday 10 times for 325 damage and he one tapped me anyway…..was wild lmao
Basaltmyers,Usually you die by the end of it.
YungSkeltal,These sorts of bugs are server side where the server reads your magazine as empty whereas client side you're still shooting. I've heard running away and switching to your melee and back (or possibly reloading?) Fixes the issue.
beans_lel,Yes.
Direct_Possession865,If you have less than 32 gigs of ram then yes this is normal
GravelsNotAFood,"I know it isn't the answer you want, but yea. That's pretty tame. 

Put some p ammo in a kedr. It'll make those few shots seem like a 1 tap. 

And don't get me started on PMC armour. That wouldn't even have done damage to an armoured pmc."
Admins-Are-Garbage,Clearly using the wrong ammo type for that armor bruh
Gnada,It's desync
fantafuzz,"The bullet in this game comes out where the barrel is actually pointing, so we can try to figure out where each shot went.

Looks like your first shot hit his shoulder/left arm, but it might have missed, a bit hard to see.

The second shot comes out before the sights are aligned, and it appears the front sight is aligned up and left from the rear sight, meaning you hit above his right shoulder

Third shots looks like the barrel was aiming down-right from him, so you might have hit under his right elbow

Fourth shot your sights seem horizontally aligned, but front sight is below your rear sight. You also seem to be aiming somewhat left of his center, so I think the shot might have just missed down left of his thorax

Fifth shot hit, arms were in front of chest, but also your barrel was still pointing down, so you might have hit stomach. You can see the scav reacting to the hit by twisting a bit and looking down

Sixth shot might have hit his right thigh, might have missed. Looks like the sights are barely unaligned down left when you shot, but looks most like a hit. Also the scav does the look down after the shot, which seems like he got hit.

Last shot hit him in the chest"
Countcristo42,Missing is indeed normal
ShadowZpeak,"Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.

plagueapple,the shotgun spread is pretty small at that distance. you missed your shots
DoomedAccordian,"You were missing shots, then one in arm, stomach maybe twice. Think it was like 3 shots you got, so that’s normal."
myironlung6,"Welcome to tarkov. Where it makes total sense that a starving Russian tennis shoe or open toe sandal wearing scavenger with little military training is stronger, more agile, and has better equipment than a trained, roided out mercenary"
Its_Da_Muffin_Man,You missed half your shots
Kyle700,"stop shooting his arms and stomach ffs!!  I bet you had slugs in there too.  buckshot would have dropped him faster.  

to answer question tho, yes, but its a skill issue lol"
cheated_in_math,"People are defending this garbage, but it's a large part of why I don't play this shit anymore.

There's FAR TOO MANY game breaking bugs and ""features"" that make the game so fucking broken"

mikethelegacy,Welcome to tarkov. Now try to escape.
,"not netcode, but probably just a 740hp scav wearing body armor so your realism bullets all went into the arms"
Beaverlegions,"It is, have fun"
BL1FFORD,"no that’s not normal at all, usually you would’ve died after the first shot"
garack666,It’s tarkov bad game design and netcode
Bobbydylan1981,REEEEEEEAAlism.
RJohn12,"this is the #1 reasons I hate using shotguns. they do so much damage, but apparently 2mm of Kevlar armor is enough to block 90% of all of that damage."
ThePandagasm,"Well you definitely missed a couple, but should also aim for the head, Im surprised he walked towards you for that long without head tapping you"
_Dingaloo,"Hipfire!!!!!! It's insane how much people neglect to hipfire in this game. Your recoil control is one of your main issues. Just because the back sight is lined up with the scav doesn't mean you'll hit it, because your barrel wasn't straight and you didn't see the other sight through the back sight. It takes too long to recover stance when ADS, especially when ADS firing with a shotgun. Hip fire."
MiniOozy5231,"Skill issue, I fear."
White_Bread904,"Yes, the game is dog shit"
JimmyJazzz1977,I regret buying this shit so much
Stock-Chemist6872,"This game is RPG FPS it's not realistic simulator.  
Bullets have stats and so on so it's not like you take cheapest bullet and hit somebody in heart and he will die no no no... in this game if you bullet does 10 dmg at 10m you need to shot him multiple times since every area of your body have different amount of HP. Yeah if somebody told you this is realistic you got baited enjoy your RPG experience."
idontcarerightnowok,"Yes.

Scavs will eat any ammo you throw at them, get used to it.

Just another bug we'll never see fixed"
No_Interaction_4925,Shotguns are trash against armor. He was probably just soaking those shots up into a vest
Doobie717,New to the internet and Reddit as well I suppose?
EstablishmentCool197,"Yeah, happens sometimes. This shotgun is shit anyway, sights are too big and feel off, slugs are the only viable option."
Dwenki,"Skill issue and a really good gaming chair. Also if you use buckshot and he has a class 2 armor, you will not do damage."
Gzalzi,"Yeah, a couple of misses, a couple of arm hits, a stomach hit. The damage got spread out over his whole body."
JiffTheJester,Aim at the face
LocksmithCharming790,saw some scavs this week with a gzhel. Just shoot in the damn head.
Plane-Day-164,"I would suspect you were using the ammo provided for the new account given that shit show of a shotgun you were using.  So yea I would say this is normal as the standard 12 ga shell is pretty shit against tier 2 armor.  If you were using buckshot in the magnum casing, I think the first or second shot would have downed that scav.  Since you are new, I would review this site here with regards to ammo types.  https://eft.monster/"

LeSoldatRyan,No it's magic
Lamazing1021,Lmfao welcome to tarkov
SnakeSkinBots,That's scav boss Steve.  He was getting ready to clock out for the day but you strolled into his store 1 minute before closing time and really pissed him off.
KingSwank,"no, normally that shotgun scav would've just one shot you"
Vubor,Pretty much yes. I used flechette on scavs and they tanked alot of it..
nglatzhofer1,"After what scavs have done to me this wipe, they always get a full clip"
slackrock,"He has a level 2 armor on, and I’m guessing thats 7mm you’re firing. This is not a bug, this is working as intended. Arm damage killed him but only because you did so much, it blacked out the limb and spread to the torso/head (tarkov death mechanic, aka leg meta). I bet your raid result will say like “Damage to armor: 600”"

Thwarto,I put 20 HP into a Scav to put him down the other day. Game has wacky ballistics.
Wunon,Yes
BlackPrincessPeach_,"Yes.

The AI/scavs are super human and have a ludicrous amount of HP.

AI don’t get blacked limbs/limp/broken arms/pain. They only bleed out. Some even heal, especially sanitar/some bosses.

You either go for the headshot on a scav, or just don’t bother."
ScythenKing,"I mean it’s still a video game, they aren’t going to code in blast physics or at least not yet. Yes it’s pretty normal at that point head or legs would be best."
xSonofgeek,If this is slug rounds. Yeah seems normal. Buckshot? Ill resort to the default response: game is broken
thedrizztman,and THIS is how OP learned about 'leg meta'
PillagetheVillage,Real life 1 shot dudes hurting 2nd shot probably dead at that range but this is Tarkov so... You can absorb everything

mmpa78,Yes
Anom8675309,Yes and that same gun in the hands of scavs will one tap you from 150m. All normal. Please enjoy your tarkov experience.
mudokin,"No thqat is definatly not normal, the scav should have onetapped you after tanking the first shot. The fact that you were alive afther this encounter is not normal."
Caine_Pain333,Bro actually missed
porter--05,Yea if it's 7 mm those shells are booty
SSHz,"Don't worry, it's a ***Beta***™

Surely they're just experimenting and not at all fucking up."
Sanujan_,Yeah this looks like bullshit but... Take cover when you’re pumping that POS and your sights weren’t lined up. Slugs shoot stupid high too you missed a lot.
AngrywhenMad,There are some scavs with larger health pools that spawn maybe 1/10 times a raid. If he was wearing armor I'd do what most people suggested and hide/repeak since scavs have the object permanence of a 4 year old.
unibomber24,Shots 1-5
Reasonable_Pie_3376,"I genuinely feel bad for players / the devs when I see stuff like this lol the only thing it seems were fighting in this game sometimes are server issues. I'm guessing there was a blip happening here because the final shot knocks back the scav like he had been getting ripped at. Whatever tho its just a game and making money in this game doesn't take to long, just frustrating when your time gets wasted."
acaerus,"Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because you was already dead."
Avarice21,"You're playing an rpg, not a sim. His stats are high, and also armor. It's silly."
ckole11,I noticed shots are not registering. I hit a center mass shot at 15 yards with a mosin and heard the guy scream but there was no hit on the report
CorvusEffect,"Protip, Don't stand in the open when you are pumping your shotgun. Shoot, in cover, pump, out cover, shoot, repeat.  


Every time I see people complain about scavs, they stand out in the open like this and wonder why scavs fuck them up. It's because y'all stand out in the open and aim for armour and go shot-for-shot with them."
prUssian_gloriA_CA,Welcome to Tarkov.
Dr_Moisty_boi,yes
somenoefromcanada38,"some of these do in fact miss, however you do hit some of them. Use magnum buck and aim for the head with that particular shotgun. Don't spam it aim properly for the head with it. Other shotguns that are semi can be spammed but that ones more accurate so spamming results in missing due to your sights not being realigned fully yet. Chest usually has the highest armor and health level."
BooBs_In_My_Inbox,Well they had to enhance the scavs so they could make the cheaters less noticeable.
Scavwithaslick,"Buckshot won’t go through armour, if he had an armour on it could’ve eaten the pellets, try to aim for the legs with buckshot and low caliber rounds"
Mieser_Duennschiss,"yeah. your bullet-numbers are smaller than his armor-numbers, so he can tank a dozen shots no problem.

this is the exact reason alot of people like me cant get into the game. I really tried, have at least 50 hours, but shit like this makes it feel like a waste of time.

everything else about this game is amazing."
drewbaccaaaaa,"Checks out, happens all the time. Enjoy your stay!"
GrapeGang19,The fact that you didn’t get head/eyes by a terminator shotgun scav is not normal
Firm_Woodpecker_1875,"haha no its not ""normal"" does it happen? yes i dont think its happend to me this wipe yet but rubberbanding is bad and happens quite often nostly  on streets"
flying_wargarble,"Looks like is that door is desynced somehow and it's actually closed ,which has been happening forever, but the fact that the scav shoots at you is weird."
FilthyPeasant_Red,Slugs? buckshots? I'm assuming he had armor?
iMattist,"Tarkov is clunky because it wants to be realistic. 

Also Tarkov someone can get shot in the chest with a shotgun and doesn’t flinch."
FRALDAMAGE,No
Hoaxtopia,No but yes (??)
iam_odyssey,Welcome to tarkov.
SovietEra00,Yep.
BecomePnueman,Yes.  This game is dogshit.  Seriously maybe play a bit more and enjoy some of the coolness of the grandness of its design but then stop because it's fundamentally a completely broken experience.
Kilo-Nein,"Yeah, sadly it is."
kamalama63,I- yeah….
dorekk,What we have here is a combination of game knowledge (bad ammo) and the utterly shit design of Tarkov.
ATacticalBagel,"TL;DR: it is normal and could have been worse, dont shoot arms.

YSK: All PMCs have a total of 440 HP distributed among their limbs, head, chest and stomach. This does not increase with skills or any injectors. However, there are 3 variations of Scavs with 440/540/**740** Max HP.

(740 is ridiculous and should be removed IMO. flesh is flesh IRL. If you want a beefy scav in the game, put some good armor or bulk on them so we can tell it's gonna take twice the amount of lead to drop them).

The gratuitous 740 Scav has 150 chest, 150 stomach and 100 health on each arm. The damage in this video seemed to be distributed among the left arm, chest and stomach (\~400 total as a possible max). likely, they were running 7mm with 39dmg per round (273 possible damage with those 7 shots. unfortunately, the math works out that this will not be enough to drop a max HP Scav if the arm absorbed it's full 100 dmg and the remaining 173 was somewhat evenly distributed among the stomach and chest. But it looks like most of it went into the left arm, and then was distributed at a 30% reduced rate, proportionally over the rest of the body (The chest and head only take \~20% of 70% of 39dmg (\~6dmg) each time you shoot a Max Scav's blacked arm with 7mm if no other zones are blacked)

N4hire,"It’s heads or nothing in Tarkov. When it comes to Tarkov you can put enough lead in chest to turn any armored dude rib cage into grind dust and the fucker won’t die. 

Hell, the aim punch was removed because people complained..

It’s head or nothing unless you are rocking the Ks-23 or something like it."
edude45,Yes
Apprehensive-Room-24,"Ammo really matters in this game. Presumably, you were probably using 7mm buck shot or something low tier. Whatever crap armor he was using essential tanked all of that damage. There will be two damage outputs shown at the end of the match. One based of armor damage, and one of flesh damage. You probably did 200 worth of armor damage. If you had better ammo, it would punch right through that, when using lesser ammo, go for legs or head. Best of luck to ya, you’re gonna die, like a lot, probably an average of half the raids you do you will die, maybe even more. I usually end a wipe with 50-65% survival rate. But the rush and adrenaline from being in fights is unmatched, I’ve yet to find another game that gets my heart pumping as fast as tarkov."
johnguyver123,"Some of your shots, the sights werent realigning."
,"If you were shooting 7mm, he had any armor and it kept hitting the thorax it would make sense. Knowing where to shoot with what ammo helps a lot. Armor piercing ammo can go dead center, flesh ammo (or ammo with low armor piercing) should go at unprotected parts. Legs, arms, stomach, and face if possible"
Macl2020,"Yeah it’s pretty normal, normally they will kill you before you kill them, but welcome to tarkov!"
TOMisfromDetroit,"You're aiming at neck level at point blank range so height over bore is causing you to dump all that buckshot into what looks like at least a level 3 armor vest. Yeah, you hurt him with some blunt damage but that's it."
Lucky_Excitement8639,With shottys you gotta aim at the legs
epikszke,Welcome to Tarkov :)
Omisco420,Yes
Dendemen1355,Skill issue
ProDunga,Aim for the head buddy
PlacidDrugs,"Not normal.  That scav would've killed me head/eyes, then as my screen faded to black, I'd have heard him laugh and say ""gg ez""."
Kavorkiack,Yes
portymd,People still play this game?
Shadowkrieger7,"Yes, this is very normal with your shooting not counting. Generally, you have to play this game like splinter cell and never be caught by the bots that see through walls, bushes, etc and shoot you prior to you coming around corners and auto headshotting you with iron sights from 300+ meters away."
moonlightsonata88,Yes.
stoicyeoman,Yeah I had some terminator 2 judgement day scavs coming at me last night.
A1pH4W01v,"Yeah unfortunately, it seems like 12 gauge buckshots travelling at the speed of sound and impacting at the force of a 4 ton truck, does not deal enough damage to the flesh/internals."
Bonus-Representative,No normally you'd get pwned by Player before you got to a Scav
ShaddyDaShadow,"Yes with shotguns except a few select ammos you wont penetrate even the lowest tier of armors, and to kill people you need to aim for face and or legs and arms.  Leg meta meme is a thing for a reason with this game.  This also applies to most smgs unless you are using AP ammo."
Atreaia,Aim at the head.
jhdeval,I hit a player the other day 7 times with a 12 gauge and he only took 200 damage with no armor. You hit me 8 tines with ANY 12 gauge shot and I don't think I am getting up
RatCamYT,"Remember, you're using Lead slugs against a scav that could have up to GOST 3 armor (I can't see it) and up to 740 max HP with a gun that has bad irons. This is pretty regular tarkov bullshit, but in this scenario there's a lot of variables at play."
Sinikal_,Not gonna lie it looks like the first SIX shots hit arms/missed.    That's another factor as to why this happened.
blacktransam77,I have a clip nearly identical to this. The worst part is it’s long enough that you think to yourself in the moment “what tf is going on”. Then I died
ZestyPyramidScheme,"It depends on your type of ammo. There is some really really shit shotgun ammo that does as much damage as an air soft gun. I want to assume you head buck shot loaded based off of not getting a hit even when missing. 

If you slow down the footage you can see this:

Shot 1: potential hit. Either hit his left arm or missed completely

Shot 2: potential hit. Either hit his right arm or shot just below it. On this shot you had him in your rear sight but not lighted up with the front site. So your gun was angled when you shot it which is making it hard to tell if you hit or not. 

Shot 3: you definitely missed. You were aiming too far to the left

Shot 4: most likely a miss, or you just barely got his right side

Shot 5: hit. You can see the scav stumble and miss his shot

Shot 6: either missed or just grazed his right leg

Shot 7: hit. Center mass. Scav doesn’t seem to be wearing armor so it’s a kill shot"
xzeon11,Bro shooting bbs
Crucalus,"Tactical realism, sweaty 😎"
SovietCyka,Now you know why cops magdump
iSaltyParchment,"God damn bro, do our PMCs not have shoulders? Where there fuck is the stock slipping too? This recoil is insane"
NauFirefox,"Slowing down the clip, and not posting the dumb meme:

1st shot was a bit to the right, probably clipped the arm with a few pellets, assuming it wasn't slugs.

2nd shot probably hit, but hit his right arm, several pellets missed for sure. If it's a slug, that might just be shotgun aim slipping past the arm, or you actually black the arm there.

3rd shot is lined up below the right arm, no hit.

4th shot, hit again, same spot as second.

5th shot, opposite arm. Limbs are hard to kill with, you've only hit arms so far.

6th shot, right in the groin, 4 hits in different non-critical area's, he's probably bleeding and very near dead. You've probably blacked both arms + stomach and caused a lot of damage from overflow.

7th shot, you can actually see blood appear on the arm again. So even that isn't a chest shot. 

If you're running slugs, this makes the most sense, as I didn't see any other blood spatters. Killing from limbs with slugs is a lot of work. If this was buckshot you got a bit unlucky, but generally it's still limb shots the whole way through."
SumoNinja92,"Aim for the dick, the recoil will guide you to their head."
Grizzly4nicator,Had this happen the other day. Shot the scav 6-8 times (I saw the blood splatter each hit) and dude just kept coming.
TychusCigar,"People saying this game is realistic and then every match is shit like this lol.

""Just get a better ammo type 😭😭😭""

This guy would never be able to shake off like 5 pumps of a shotgun irl regardless of armor"
RealTacticalTipToe,Yea man that sums it up. Get that refund asap
VoxVirtus,"That scav is wearing lvl 3 armor, you probably dusted the armor and eventually got through it. 

It's that blue level 3 armor specifically which is steel so it will take shots better than say a ceramic plate."
Ambientus,Normal for Tarkov.
Lianides,"Yep, happened to me today, except I didn’t survive it"
smegmathor,"You're hitting chest and arms alot here, so yeah"
self_loathing_ham,Think of scavs more like zombies now. You have to aim for the head.
RiFLE_,Kinda
flatspotting,the scav wouldve 1 shot me after the first shotgun shot lol
Austinduke25,Par for the course
PutridAppointment69,Aim for the head
mynameajeff69,LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Lakitu47,"Buckshot does nothing against even low level armour, hit then toes or the face"
MisterEnreichening,"If you have a shotgun, and the first shell does nothing to their chest, then go for either the legs or head.

The only damage you did to him was whatever hit his arms."
Shitvagina1176,Skill issue IMO
MrPineKone,"It fucken shouldnt be my man, its the yellow jacket i swear, this twat in customs took 18 rounds of 762.49 ps to.the chest and boped me with a pp9 I WAS 3 MIN INTO THE RAID"
Komacho,You're clearly hacking. I'd have been head-eyes after the first shot.
dutxh0007,Probably one of the worst shotguns in the game. Same thing happens for me. But not the 153 or the m3.
JoganLC,Honestly with how this game works I would not be surprised if half these missed.
boofmydick,What are you tryin' to tell me? That I can dodge bullets?
b8ley,completely
eebro,1 aimed shot is worth more than 8 in the chest
dimsumdonair2,"Tip for ya 


That shotgun has issues 

Try the other ones"
