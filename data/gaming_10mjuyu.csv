CookieZ_PoE,FORESKIN: Director's Cut
ThisFinnishguy,"""My Foreskin was stolen at birth. They have taken everything from me, but I'm here to get it back... This, is my story"""
spacetraxx,"Cool font, at first glans."
blizzaga1988,"Between this, Charlie's Angels, and the Resident Evil TV show, Ella Balinska sure is having a rough time."
Slow-Law-5033,I almost missed the title  lol.
bmcell85,This game being released as a demo was such a cool move on the part of the studio but i'd imagine other game developers will use it as a reason to NOT release demos anymore since many many people decided not to buy the game based off their experience on the demo.. i'm one of those people lol.. i was so excited for this game.. the demo was a big let down but i'm thankful they had a demo..  I'll probably play this game whenever it is free on PS plus
mtahsin1246,"This lady can't seem to catch a break.
3 big projects, all flopped.

She starred in the new Charlie's Angels movie and the garbage Netflix Resident Evil."
TehRiddles,"I've been laughing at all the poor dialogue and all that over the past few weeks, shocked by the specs compared to the graphics, but the other day I saw a video with the VA. She was really happy and excited about the game finally coming out, she clearly had big hopes built up for the game.

That just made me sad."
Honda_TypeR,"That fuckin price tag was a large part of early adoption. They need to chill out on those new release prices. I’d check this game out for 20-30 bucks on day one fuck 80-90 though rarely are any games worth that.

There is a cross over point where things get so expensive that want/need conversation come into play and if it’s a lukewarm game you’re unsure about (like this one) it’s just a no thanks hard pass."
AVE_CAESAR_,I honestly have no idea what this game is about. Marketing for it was not good IMO.
Recipe-Jaded,"For those of you wondering why people are mad about this game:

The price was more than normal. 80 euro or 70 dollars. Clearly money grabbing off of the hype.

The graphics are not ""next gen"" as claimed. There are many scenes that look like it is an 8 year old game.

Poor optimization, the minimum requirements are ridiculously high compared to how the game looks.

The story is not that great. It kind of feels like it was written by ChatGPT. Same with the dialogue.

The main character is kind of cringe when she talks. There's also a lot of pointless dialogue.

The combat is meh.

The ""open world"" is about as alive as sonic frontiers.

The gameplay itself is pretty good... It isn't a bad game, but it certainly is not worth the money. I also think people are being hyper-critical because of the advertising around this game. They claimed it was a next-gen AAA title, when it wasn't."
Orangesoda65,If you are Jewish can you still play?
ErgoProxy0,"Watched someone play it for 5 hours and the dialogue is just as cringe as everyone says. Cursing every chance she gets, weird British cuff/bracelet thing who seems to know nothing about the world aside from a few places. The game is just one big weird isekai anime except the main character isn’t over-powered"
Chill_McCool,Did i just do that?
leighmcg,"""Uhh, hello? Did I literally just look at a foreskin? Are you kidding me?! Did I just do that?! I just looked... at... FREAKING FORESKIN!!! Alright check me out, that is something I do now, I look at Foreskin!""

""Mmmmaster you MIGHT have benefited from my assistance looking at this foreskin""

""I'm freaking LOOKING at FORESKIN now!!!!!""

""Indubitably"""
medhatsniper,"been under a rock, can someone explain to me why it flopped?

granted the trailer i saw a long ago didn't exactly captivate me but it seemed may be worth a shot"
Flat_Implement9984,"took me 10 seconds,disqualified  redditor"
Interesting-Big1980,"I genuinely feel sorry for the game. The fighting and traveling was done so good just to be overlapped by terrible optimization, plot, lore, graphics and scenario."
bobeaqoq,"Is it really that bad, or did it just not live up to high expectations? How does it compare to Cyberpunk's launch?"
Swordbreaker925,">we can all agree the title has one of the coolest fonts

Foreskin jokes aside, it really doesn’t. I’ve always hated the logo even before i saw the game."
Xizziano,Flopped? It just released
WolfgangVolos,"You're still playing FORESKIN?

I've moved onto FIVESKIN. It has better mounts."
opensourcer,Is there a director's cut version?
Judgement915,"As soon as I heard that journalists hadn't gotten a review copy 4 days before release, I knew it was going to be bad."
TJae0120,Foreskin
NineIntsNails,imagine paying shitloads of money to play that game
JuggernautNo9938,"Eh. 6/10, doom font is still king."
Jbell_1812,I guess a good font was more important than good voice acting
all-that-is-given,"I'm buying this game to see for myself. I tend to like""bad"" games and want to see what all the fuss is about."
PMmeYourNoodz,has it flopped??
apollohay,"What’s been bothering me about this game is that they expect us to pay 70 bucks for what essentially is a 15 hour game. The order was like that too. It’s not like I’m expecting a 80-120 hour rpg but 30–35 hours with a reason to replay would have been nice. This should have been at an Indie price, 29 bucks or something. This doesn’t fix the story or gameplay though, it would have been DOA no matter how you cut it."
erichw23,The fuck is Forsaken
Zanefry,"Refund Forspoken, Buy Hi-Fi Rush."
SkyWizarding,"At first I thought I was just reading it wrong and felt like a weirdo........then I realized, I am a weirdo just not because of this"
Raph2051,Flopped? How? Didn’t just come out?
cyreneok,Force pokin'
Poisonpython5719,Obligatory r/sbubby
Bionic164,Is this an actual game? What’s it about? I’m afraid to google “foreskin game”
Icehellionx,It was weird having people state it dropped on literal launch day.  Feels like they just want it to fail and if we all say it enough it has regardless of sales.
FlebianGrubbleBite,Did it already flop? I didn't even know it came out yet
GladiatorJones,Legitimately didn't realize this had officially come out. Thought it was next week or something.
Cardiacfiber67,The lord of the cock ring
NoFilanges,"So THIS is allowed in this sub, but I can’t say that someone is objectively an idiot because they can’t count to four without them going whining to the reddit mods themselves?!!

lol"
Wowplays,Should’ve been papyrus
Ripplerfish,It flopped? Game's pretty fun. Wonder why it flopped.
Ale_X_aos,Flopped? I'm having best time of gaming since elden ring.
Thorgilias,Pricing is insane. No thanks!
Vutdevuk,"At least when it comes to the name, they have things covered."
sack_of_potahtoes,Is it just me or this character looks just like valkyrae?
Unlimitles,I wonder how I would feel about new releases if Social media didn't exist......makes me really miss the years before 2006.
bordersofsin,I haven’t played the game yet. But I’m confident in saying that the best thing about this game is Ella Balinska. What a staggeringly gorgeous woman.
ArcaneTekka,"It's no Papyrus, but it'll do"
DEEZLE13,Foreskin might’ve actually been a more enjoyable game
JGauv921,Every time I saw this pop up on the ps store I thought said foreskin. Is there something wrong with me?
ttubehtnitahwtahw1,Should go down in marketing 101 of how not to advertise a game.
hexthejester,"Every time i see a forsaken post all i start thinking is ""in your eyes forsaken me"" and i want it to stop"
OuterSpace95,I agree until we hear the person on the cover talk
Snidrogen,Can’t wait for this to be a monthly free game on PSN before summer rolls around.
Abaddon866,How has it flopped hasn’t it only been out like 3 days?!?
Nickizgr8,"Another flop from SE, glad they're using the money from FFXIV wisely like investing in these shite games rather than reinvesting in FFXIV."
MyStationIsAbandoned,"I feel bad for this actress. She's fine as hell and I like seeing her face. but at the same time...when I see her, all I can think of is that shitty Resident Evil Show, that shitty Charlie's Angels where they said ""this isn't for me so don't even watch it."" ""this movie failed because men refused to watch it! omg!"" and this cringe game that people are already saying ""people hate this game because it's about a black women"". Dammit. I'm black. Stop using my skin color as a shield for shitty video games, shows, and movies.

This woman needs to fire her agent right now and get a better one."
supamonkey77,Didn't know anything about this game. Just checked steam and its something I might be interested in. But $70? And bad reviews? I'll try it but after a super deep discount on sale.
KayJune001,"Why does everyone seem to think the game flopped? It reviewed decently, it reached top 10 selling on Steam, and it’s got a good 30k viewer average on Twitch. That’s honestly not bad.

Say what you want about it, but the gameplay itself is pretty fun."
pox97,"Its not a bad game at all, played much worse than this. Gotham Knights was awful compared to this"
TyperMcTyperson,"lol. In all seriousness, this game has some of the worst UX design I can remember. Just fucking awful."
Hakameet,Forsen
BriGuyBeach,"How is it a flop exactly? The game is mediocre, but it's playable. It seems too early to call it a flop though, unless flop doesn't mean ""financially unsuccessful."""
Poetryisalive,I love how Reddit is basically assuming the game flopped without sale numbers.
dimmidice,Seemed like a pretty cool game from what i've seen of it.
curious-pandaad,I bought the game just because of the cool picture and font
SecXy94,"Is the game bad? Not seen much on it, looked interesting at the announcement."
nahteviro,Lol how does something flop that hasn’t even been out for a full week yet?
LtDkAngel,Am I the only on that enjoys this game?
mindpieces,“Flopped” when it’s been out for 3 days lol
broen13,I've been looking forward to this one and didn't even know it was out!  WTH
SadLaser,Isn't it too early to say it flopped..?  We don't know how well it sold yet.  Or how well it will continue to sell.
100FootWallOfFog,Literally the only thing I've heard about this game is that it flopped lol
Daracaex,"I’m actually looking forward to playing it at some point. Not too high priority right now, but the gameplay seems fun."
d-I-am,forsen
RipMcStudly,I prefer “Chorvs” from a few years ago.
Tagichatn,Did it actually flop or are people just circlejerking about how much it sucks on social media?
nixinthi,"Talking to a foreskin, yeah I guess that’s something I do now!"
ProfessionalStand450,How is a game that just released a flop? Has it even been out 24 hours? The reviews are terrible. But I don’t think it’s possible to say it’s a flop. It probably will be but declaring it today is silly.
Rathemon,Foreskin?
Kujaix,We mean critically right? Sales wise it seems like it's doing decent enough though I'm sure nowhere close to where SE wanted. Even critically the game gets overly hated. It's an average to mediocre game marketed as a AAA blockbuster. If it wasn't hyped by SE so much it would have come and gone like the last Valkyrie game or Xenoblade 3 that people don't talk much about(not saying these games are on par).
grillntech,"Everyone:
Joke

Their head"
crazy_dizzle,"Honey, where art thou my foreskin?"
