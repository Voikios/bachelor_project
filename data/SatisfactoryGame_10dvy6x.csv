NinjaBr0din,"Hey, look, someone found my first attempt at a hyper cannon.

Weird, when I did it Becky punched a hole in spacetime and took out the dinosaurs, you did it and brought back dragons... I wonder what will happen when the next person does it. Reptilians maybe?"
Zenvarix,"At this point, I'm hoping a different game does the ""start with the player slowly waking up from a black screen to some easily iconic (but different) dialogue"", if only so there'd be some variety to spice the ol' black screen with the chance that it could be one or the other. I suggest ""man, what will they cook up next"" for characters waking up from a wild high.

I took a pinch of salt with the title (you showed a bit of your hand) but at the blackout I was preparing to eye roll. 

Well done. Somehow you are my first Skyrim cart ride of 2023! (There is no sarcasm intended in this last section, and only light sarcasm meant in the rest of the comment)"
