HappyAmbition706,"USA fucked up health care system. I believe they cost something like ‚Ç¨12.50 for the 2 doses, which was about double of the AstraZeneca at the time. And of course it was paid by the state (Germany for me). Boosters are ""free"" too. We do pay health insurance tax monthly, so ""included"" is more accurate than ""free"".

I'm sure that Moderna, Pfizer and the rest have calculated what is the highest price point to maximize their executive pay and bonuses, disguised as shareholder value. They'll do this market by market, and since the USA has by far the highest health care costs, it is easy to get the highest prices. Also expect the highest costs for getting it put in your arm."
LeicaM6guy,Because nobody has stopped them.
Just-Examination-136,"Moderna CEO said: ""I think it‚Äôs a hard argument to make in value-based pricing to say that vaccines ought to be priced at 10 cents ... That, I think, comes not from the economic argument, that comes from the public health argument,"" he added.

Winner Take All Capitalism....what a great thing!"
Instantfeedback1,"This is all a result of lobbyists impact to politics and government. No public money would be available to Big Pharma if they weren‚Äôt paying tens of millions a year to ‚Äúsupport‚Äù political campaigns. 

In turn, our duly elected officials turn the other way when they charge full price for a government subsidized service. Some will say that ‚Äúwe wouldn‚Äôt have a vaccine if we didn‚Äôt do this,‚Äù and you‚Äôre right. They would let us die if they couldn‚Äôt make a ton of money on it.

Edit: changed ‚Äúsupport‚Äù senators to ‚Äúsupport‚Äù political campaigns. Much more folks to blame that JUST the senate."
Branamp13,">So how can Moderna plan to charge $110 a jab?

Well you see, they're a corporation under American capitalism, which means they can do pretty much anything that they want to as long as all they're doing is fucking over consumers and the general public. 

The US government has shown quite clearly over the last half century that it exists to protect the corporations from masses, not the other way around."
Senior-Sharpie,"Because this is capitalism working as intended. Taxpayers fund research needed to develop many medicines but when they are developed they are free to charge what the market can bare. Look at insulin, $2,000 per mont here and $12 in Canada. 
Obama took a lot of flack for pointing how business owners benefit from taxpayer funded things like infrastructure while AOC was pilloried for rejecting an Amazon warehouse that was going to be given so much in tax break incentives that it would have been the taxpayers who paid their employees salaries for years to come.
The sense of entitlement displayed by the rich is as disgusting as it is unpatriotic."
shadow1515,"I mean, it was 100% free to everyone for like 2 years. I fuckin' *hate* the economics of pharmaceuticals and how much of a black hole it is but I have trouble being too mad about this."

stupidugly1889,Socialism for me capitalism for thee
omni42,"All pharmaceuticals and tech subsidized by US money need to be subject to federal patent, so they can be made broadly available at a reasonable cost.

Kwoody1711,"Moderna is planning to charge $130 for its COVID vaccine, but the vaccine only costs $2.85 to make.

Meanwhile, over the last two years, the company made over $19 billion in profits off the vaccine. 

Folks, this is what corporate greed looks like."
ProfessorTicklebutts,"Wow, is the American public finally waking up to something that has been happening for decades? Taxpayers pay for R&D, corporations get the profits. Particularly in tech. Then those people get to act like geniuses. Sweet deal."
duebel,"I don‚Äôt understand why this is even news; it‚Äôs so rhetorically stupid. The NIH is finally generating revenue by licensing the IP they co-developed with the $30b investment. Moderna has listed the NIH as co-inventors on their COVID vaccine patents. Moderna doesn‚Äôt have another huge government contract driving the price down through sales volume, so they‚Äôre raising the price to fund their $4b 2023 R&D pipeline (which includes a potential cure for cancer). Why are we blaming Moderna and Pfizer for doing what corporations do when the actual failures are squarely caused by government?

(Edit: punctuation)"
CaffeineJunkee,Capitalism and corruption will slowly kill every country. America is no different.
semideclared,"Our rating: Missing context

The U.S. government has given Moderna Therapeutics about $2.5 billion, including federal grants for university research, for the development of the company's vaccine and to purchase doses once approved. To say that the vaccine is fully funded by the federal government discounts a small but very real private donation to Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Based on our research, we rate the claim MISSING CONTEXT."
viewerslikeme,"Wasn‚Äôt this part of the point of ‚ÄúOperation Warpspeed‚Äù? You remove all regulatory barriers, and made society pay for R&D costs of unproven medicines, and in exchange we got a Covid vaccine inside of like 12 months. 

I‚Äôm not saying this isn‚Äôt really shitty, but it was always part of the deal that we gave up control of these in exchange for private industry getting its ass in gear. 

The fact that pharma companies decided to eventually be assholes shouldn‚Äôt be a shock"
sgthulkarox,"Because ""Fuck You!"", that's why."
CoolCatInaHat,"The US has this asinine policy of allowing companies to socialize all expenditures and losses while privatizing any gains. We pay for the environmental damages companies cause, we bail them out when they go bankrupt, we pay them billions to develop new technologies, infurstructure, and medicines and we demand absolutely nothing in return.  The taxpayers money is given to companies so that they can keep more of the profits and write off their losses. The US government is anti-robinhood, taking from the poor and giving it to the rich."

Chemical_Knowledge64,"Universal. Health. Care.

Whether the system is single payer (my personal preference), like Canada or uk, or a multi payer system, like Germany or some other European nations, where coverage is still guaranteed from birth til death in their laws, we need healthcare for all since decades ago.

OnTheFenceGuy,"Welcome to Capitalism, where we subsidize the costs, and privatize the profits!"
patrick_j,It‚Äôs easy. Socialize the losses and privatize the profits. EZPZ
Tellurian_Cyborg,We only modified an existing vaccine that been approved and in use since ~2010. (This is why the FDA was able to approve the vax so fast). A lot of the $30B went to R&D at multiple companies. The rest went to buying and distributing the covid vaccine plus the cost to administer same.
Calix19,People in support of the vaccine shouldn‚Äôt call it the jab.  That was a term popularized by the deniers who couldn‚Äôt bring themselves to legitimize it by calling it a vaccine because it sounded too medical.
Professional_360,"If Biden can cap insulin he should be able to cap this. The only reason I can see this is because the damn insurance companies are willing to pay for it.

I went to the doctor a week ago and my 15 minute visit, which didn't include any tests whatsoever, was $192. Thankfully Medicare covered it but Medicare and United Healthcare should be telling doctors to fuck off with their insane billing practices. The entire medical industry gets away with so much shit because the insurance industry allows it."
yotothyo,Whenever I hear the word ‚Äújab‚Äù I just tune out. Isn‚Äôt that word basically what anti vaxxers call it?
za4h,"I mean doesn't this happen with most of our tax dollars? We pay taxes, a huge chunk is handed out to corporations, and those corporations use that money to research and develop stuff to sell back to us. 

It's a massive con. So long as politicians aren't forced to put all their holdings into blind trusts, they will forever allow this kind of bullshit. A few hundred politicians make bank by ripping of hundreds of millions of taxpayers. That's the American way."
Swish887,This is a deal. Read another company wants to raise the price 400%.
robjpod,"Capitalism, baby. That‚Äôs why."
aquarain,"The more you charge per jab, the more you make per jab but the fewer you sell. It's a rather complex function to determine how many have to remain unvaccinated to optimize your profit yield. But it's a well travelled path so of course the computer spits out this amount.

The damage to the public health of this approach? Why would they worry about that? They're a business.

Which is the problem with relying on businesses to provide resources essential to public health."

Mr-Warmth,Oh that's easy...late stage capitalism and zero ethical consideration.
Skurvy2k,Because capitalism.
Serenityprayer69,"I wonder if it has to due with all that money the pharmaceutical companies donate? Hmmm so strange. It's weird how COVID came along and everyone forgot how incestuous and corrupt pharma and politics are.  People wonder why there was so much vaccine hesitancy.  This is why. I'm not saying the vaccine doesn't work. All though it's efficacy was clearly overstated at the start of the pandemic. I'm just saying. Those people you laugh at for dying after not taking the vaccine.  They weren't exactly suspicious for nothing. There's clearly massive financial motive and ab extremely long history of these companies putting profit before ethical drug making. See Vioxx, opiodes(which kill more than covid), insulin monopolies... It blows my mind how many people wiped all that clean and acted like these companies gave a fuck about anything but making money.  Why can't the world be grey? The way everyone acted like this is a total black and white issue is really sad in terms of humanities global intelligence."
SquirrelDumplins,Republican Capitalism
Kidchico,This is neo-liberalism. Isn‚Äôt it great
Chastain86,"The best part about people referring to inoculation against a deadly pandemic as ""the jab"" is realizing I never, ever have to take a single word they say seriously ever again"
FrankieMcGigglefits,"Because we let them!

The ""government"" is just a group of corporations parading around as legitimate law."
laughtract,"The government gave that money to the existing medical and research corporations to fix a problem. And now they‚Äôre double-dipping because that‚Äôs money nobody is going to miss. It‚Äôs not YOUR money, or MY money, it‚Äôs OUR money. It should be free or very close to free. 

Medical industry is run by money. Don‚Äôt get sick and go to the hospital because then you‚Äôll have a bill that introduces just as much suffering as the illness you had, often times even moreso. 

Healthcare shouldn‚Äôt be costly and unregulated to allow for this kind of predatory price gouging when it comes to human health and life-saving or life-altering treatments. 

But this is just one Reddit comment in a sea and at the end of the day isn‚Äôt going to change anything. What will is the collective voice demanding free healthcare. We must reward our doctor and nurses with heavy financial compensation, but more than not, those profits go to business execs and other high-up stakeholders. It‚Äôs ruining our system."
ThePaulestPaul,"Meanwhile, since day 1 of the vaccine many of us have been saying these big pharma companies are incredibly corrupt and we should not trust them (this shit happens all the time), but everyone wants to lump us in as right wingers or anti-vaxxers. It‚Äôs straight up fraud people!!!"

chubba5000,"I don‚Äôt think you guys followed the news well enough here. Clearly, since the funding for Covid came from government spending, which came from American tax dollars, we became automatic shareholders in Moderna because that‚Äôs your money that was used for investment.     

So while Moderna is going to charge a ridiculous, unethical, $110 a jab it‚Äôs ok because $105 (the staggering, ungodly profit) gets distributed straight back to the American people I‚Äôm the form of a dividend. That‚Äôs how that works. Move over Buffet we are all big time investors now!"
