ghostedemail,Jesus it seems like yesterday. Where the fuck did the time go
a_reply_to_a_post,taking dog tags was the shit
JP_GamingOnline,"That moment blew my mind, literally felt like I was there the first time I played that scene"
Crunchbite10,Battlefield 3 was peak gaming. Multiplayer amazing. Set pieces in campaign were dope. Miss it.
Warrior253,"I was a teen when this game came out and no FPS game has ever topped this one. The story and the online were almost perfect for me. 

I remember playing multi-player matches on private servers that had modified max points so a match could last like 2 hours. Man I miss what gaming used to be."
SharkBait209,"My god, yes MW2 was insanely fun, and a peak shooter for most

But BF3 was a different beast, holy shit it was insanely fun. Everything was so balanced! Jets, tanks, n other vehicles wrecked havoc, but you can easily get rid of them.

C4 onto an ATV drive it towards a tank or group of enemies and jump off right before and boom!!! :)

Sniping someone out of a jet or heli was SOOO satisfying!

Speaking of sniping, it was the best!! Hitting that long range shot or winning a sniper battle with someone on the boat in the middle of nowhere or on a high ass tower was so satisfying!

Man the nostalgia. M249, PKP, M27 IAR, A-91, and M98B we're my top 5.  Support FTW"
Sandee1997,battlefield 3 was my first battlefield game.  never had that high with another title in the series since
teejmonster,Played this mission real close to the TV with headphones on. I got goosebumps during takeoff.
UnholyGhoul,"""Going Hunting"" mission of BattleField 3"
Intelligent_Bed_526,"""Dum dum dum dum dum dum""

Am I the only one who heard the music from the picture?"
thethunder92,"When I was a kid I had starfox  on n64, the graphics were pretty rad on that too"
Downtown-Discount671,"Battlefield 3 will probs go down as my all time favourite fps game, the campaign & multiplayer was so much fun, hopefully one day well get another one just as good!"
Wild-Simple1908,But 2010 kids will never know the glory of unmodded BF: 1942 Wake Island.
PM_ME_YOUR_STEAM_ID,[DCS players be like:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjb6llcWJTc)
TheBigCR,"Remember the auto shotty with the explosive rounds that could just spam kill everyone indoors by shooting at the ceiling and floor? I *insist* im the one who came up with that. Yes, Im the one who ruined this game for 2 months. Youre welcome."
LRonKoresh,"""Get your fangs out Hawkins, We're hunting big game"""
brownjenkins69,BF used to be so special and so amazing. What a shame it turned into another pile of casual garbage.
moistentheweasel,"Recommend at least mentioning the game name in comments, if not the title."
A319Pilot,BF3 was peak battlefield. No idea why EA & Dice couldn‚Äôt look at it and say how do we do this now.
AmazingOsama,Feeling bad for playing it 1st time now started a week ago. Played this mission 2 days ago
Aggrokid,Amazing visuals for the time but man the singleplayer campaign was an overly-scripted Simon Says.
VaccinatedVariant,"This mission started well, till you r√©alis√© you fired 20 missiles on a plane that Carries 6 or 8 maybe"
CptWoop,Such a shame BF went from this to what it is now
SudoSuRoot,"It‚Äôs 2011 though , Battlefield 3 on PC does hold up and still looks great on modern hardware."
Freethinkwrongspeech,Back when battlefield was actually good.
FizzyTacoShop,Tbh the bigger ‚Äúwow‚Äù moment for me is when I realized that I will NOT be controlling the actual jet and just the targeting and other bullshit like come on man lmao.
37Cross,"BF3 really is the best BF game. Bad Company 2 was good but waaay too torture heavy if you‚Äôre on the losing side lol Well, BF3 had that too kinda for some maps but it wasn‚Äôt as bad as BC2. I miss those games regardless. Operation Metro was the best. BF4 had that prison map that was good but nothing beats the chaos that was Operation Metro"
plumppshady,These graphics are still better than most games today
MrFoozOG,And its all downhill from there
randomredditguyw,"I burnt my graphics card with this game and my screen became pink, but still, to this day, best battlefield for me"
lessdothisshit,"Clueless WSO taking a catshot with the software config page on the HUD repeater, the left display on the top level support page, the MPCD on some rabbithole BIT page of the GPS, and the right display off.

It's wild to me that these displays are so accurate, but their use here is wildly inaccurate."
alcatrazcgp,Operation: Asshat
redmongrel,"This is the scene I had my dad play when he visited us, not because he cares about gaming or my PC build at all but just because its was so wow. With chonky headphones of course."
John_Mat8882,"The whole campaign is dull, the action in that section is relatively dull too and a hell of scripting too, but wholeheartedly nice overall for immersion moments, unless you play DCS or other sims all the time hehe."
sololander,No way this came out in 2010 fml. I feel old now‚Ä¶ for me it still like couple of years back not freaking 2010.
Lucky_Cookie515,"I played BF3 like 5 times probably and I still go ""HOLY SHIT"""
Cirok28,"Bf2042 is a disgrace in comparison.

Have upgraded my PC every major BF release, except for the latest."
SouthTippBass,"The hype. The absolute fucking hype surrounding this game at launch was incredible. The countdown to launch was agonising, we ate up every piece of promotional material released. And then the game drops and its actually amazing and totally worth it! I don't see us experiencing something like that again anytime soon."
_SGP_,2010 kids? 12 year olds?
TheWhiteRabbit74,"BF3 single player campaign didn‚Äôt make a lot of sense, but holy shit was it action packed! ‚ÄòNever a dull moment‚Äô truly fits the description."
staticthreat,"[This](https://imgur.com/wZqqyEX) was a wow moment for me back in SNES days.  

Turn and Burn: No-Fly Zone

https://youtu.be/13gyVcz5Bow?t=93"
ins1der,God what happened to Battlefield :(
HerMajestysButthole,"My wow, but in a more wtf way,  moment was: *Remember. No Russian.*"
platinums99,"B.I.G.


Never forget that moment, or the chills and goose bumps, the surge, then the elation

It was a roller coaster mayn"
cRABFATHER,"BF3 was so good, but no one mentioning BF2. For me it bests all other BF-titles. Atleast regarding mutliplayer. It still got a player base and lots of mods still being made by the community."
Black_Electric,It deffinetly is jaw dropping just how clipped his helped is into the canopy.
johnnyGotHisTabla,That's almost as good as F-15 Strike Eagle on the Commodore 64.
TheRealJayk0b,"I remember it on my ps3, it was so fucking fun"
jdizzle3124,Hell I was 25 and impressed.
RavensEtchings,Kids? I was 20 üòÖ
Cosmonauto,Bf3 and bf4 were great modern shooters
Rickys101,Reminder that video game graphics haven't gotten that much better in 13 years
KuroKitty,"I don't want the near future, I don't want ww2 or ww1, I just want a new modern day battlefield game please DICE. Battlefield 4 was the last good game."
AmishUndead,"Anyone out there who loved this mission and has an interest in getting a more detailed version really needs to check out DCS (Digital Combat Simulator but no one calls it that)

It's basically a whole flight simulation with fighter jets that have fully functional weapons/radar/radios you name it. They have everything from WWII to Korean War to Vietnam to about 2000ish (anything newer is still classified and the devs take pride in making a true to life simulation). You can fly an F18 and recreate this mission if you like.

You can play PVE, PVP, Singleplayer, and even in VR!! [Check out this video](https://youtu.be/OLh02USKkHY) for a small taste of what it's like. Then join us on /r/hoggit if you want to learn more!"
HOLISTIC-VEGAN,They flopped on 2042 hard‚Ä¶ BF3 has a special place always ‚úäüèΩ
Peakomegaflare,What happened to the years man....
vi3tmix,"*Have good ends, good highs, good lows, no out lights. Ready in the back? Here we go!*"
thecoolerllcoolJ,The first mission and this one are only memorable ones of the campaign for me. I hated the lack of destruction at first in the multiplayer after playing bad company 2 religiously. God I want bad company 3 so bad.
Plenty-Device-1750,"Man, what a mission"
Plenty-Device-1750,"Graphics wise, the only real ‚Äújumps‚Äù I can recall are Crysis and BF3"
Rasta-Lion,"*you hear a deep matured voice coming from the shadows in the dark corner of the bar. You squint your eyes and see an old guy smoking a cigar, grey hairs, grey beard and scars on his face. He says to you:

""You think you're old kid? I've had several medal of honors before you got your call of duty or even seen battlefield... You think war is tough? You're lucky, back in my day you couldn't distinguish a man from a tree at a distance..."""
kidkruczev,Bf4 right? This gave me flashbacks to getting high in my dorm room doing dog fights in multiplayer. Such a shame what happened to that franchise. I feel like it just tanked
mech_man_86,"Not at all what the WSO does BTW. When the pilot was yelling at me to fire I kept thinking, you do it. That's your job."
Jian_Ng,Walking up to the flight deck seeing the jets in the rain. Maaaaan.
WestwardNorthWindow,This scene was set on the same ship I deployed on.
Wrong_Bus6250,"Wow moment for 2010 adults, too."
SgtRicko,"If only they'd let you actually control the damned jet and dogfight instead of just reacting to a bunch of QTE prompts.  Like, all you're doing is just deploying flares, dropping bombs and shooting missiles, that's it."
Bjesan_Supak,Man‚Ä¶when DICE was the shit! Miss playing BF3
SamVimesofGilead,In my opinion Bad Company 2 will always be the best.
808retro,Don‚Äôt attack me in public like this.
EmilyDontAsk,"The fucking fighter jet mission? you couldnt even fly the thing, you just sat in the back seat and pressed buttons when the game told you to.    

yall are blinded by nostalgia"
mtgtfo,Pretty sure this was 2011 around the same time Skyrim released. 2010 was Halo: Reach and Black Ops
LETT3RBOMB,That's not World of Warcraft at all
indoguju416,Still looks amazing
The_Flatulent_Taco,I played through this campaign about 4 months ago and I was wowed all over again.
ThatGamerMoshpit,Back when devs and publishers cared about their games.
Orcasubmarine,"Just a shame, it's about as engaging as ""Press F to pay respects""."
Yastiandrie,I upgraded to Windows 7 for this game back in the day...and immediately made the start menu look like XP's
MHWGamer,"bf3 was so mindblowing good for me that I've never touched COD in my life for more than a few days of free weekend.
I could spend 50 bucks on a cod or play bf3 again, the choice is always the same"
InAllItsForms,As I replied to the OP - call of duty black ops 1 had a campaign that was 10x better than BF3 - and I played more battlefield post 2010 than COD so I‚Äôm not a fanboy - the mission where you get in the SR71 Black Bird - or breaking out of Vorkuta and the twist at the end.. black ops romped battlefield in 2010 and battlefield beat call of duty the years since until the latest cod
