immacomputah,"we can make them bigger, We Have The Technology!"
WasChristRipped,"Okay, so someone looked at the original model and said ‚Äúokay but you know what this REALLY needs?‚Äù"
Winjin,"Ok so hear me out. I've got a new FF plot. There's this Final Fantasy character, but she's got a huge pair of boobs. I mean some serious honkers, a real set of badonkers."
leeswervino,Alert the ~~French~~ Italian Embassy!
asian_identifier,[and then there's the statue](https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-tifa-statue-eastudio-favorgk/)
Philly_ExecChef,Limit break on that bra strap
SlapmyFace,[Where are the box hands then](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q6huxtRFCYM/maxresdefault.jpg)
imsurethisoneistaken,"My gf played this when it first came out and when Tifa first came on screen she actually said ‚Äúwow she got big titties‚Äù 

Guess they didn‚Äôt nerf em enough"
BarrytheNPC,what im pissed about is cloud. he had a cool-ass purple outfit and now it's just black
psychlohunter,"That look on Cloud's face, though.

""Don't look!  Don't look!  Don't look!  ...  Crap, I looked!""

He's going to have to put that crossdressing experience to use and tuck it.  Gonna be a long journey, though."
Xyrus2000,"Tifa ""Ow my f\*cking back"" Lockhart."
MrDerpYT,Least horny gamer
Mumei451,Tig ole biddies.
umGui01,"Wish they kept them square shaped like the original too, I still mourne the death of Lara Croft traffic cone tities to this day."
ThinkFree,I'll just leave this here: https://imgur.com/a/aQmwqCH (Tifa NSFW)
zbdabsolut0,"Honestly, if they had come out with a comparison picture like this when it first came out showing how ridiculous they are. I think people wouldn't have made such a big deal."
Krumblump,[Watch out for those pointy bits!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDqea9cWOn4)
ResponsibilityDue448,13 year old me had a crush on Tifa.   So does 35 year old me.
metarinka,"Y'all are dirty animals

[here's the mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7remake/mods/669)"
CarlitoNSP1,"The proportions look closer to the FMV models.

In retrospect, FF7 had a strange amount of Art Style switches. 

Overworld/Walking around  - Chibi exaggerations

Battles - Comparably realistic

FMV - A weird middle ground between the two (Except Aeris who was surprisingly consistent)"
GentlmanSkeleton,There is eventually a point you hit diminishing returns on the hotness.
DeadPoster,Tifa don't care much for brassieres.
bladnoch16,Tifa looking like a Canadian shop teacher‚Ä¶
tennoskoom_,"Whenever u enter battle, she automatically casts gravity twice."
Deadpool1205,Wait this isn't r/gamingcirclejerk?
MetroidJunkie,"We can go deeper. -Nude Tifa-

Even deeper. -Skeleton Tifa-

Even DEEPER. -Literally no model loaded at all-

Perfection."
fullacheeze,"Hitomi, is that you? üßê"
TrinityF,>Look how they butchered my Italian prime minister.
Armitaco,Yeah a lot of the exaggerated proportions of the manga style would not have translated well to remake‚Äôs more realistic style
Evelyne-The-Egg,My back hurts looking at this
Farm_N3rd502,Y'all better be washing those hands before you hit the up vote. Or at least use hand sanitizer.
dorian283,She looks like she was designed by a 12 year old who just discovered boobs make his tummy feel all funny.
BeginningGas3569,Them tits
Pimej,Why is this sub so h o r n y lmao
Clouduot,These are dumb hills to die on
jambudz,Titty Lockhart
Color_blinded,Now make size of Clouds hair match the original.
supershimadabro,That looks ridiculous
genocidenite,Tifa not wearing her sports bra.
Sufficient-Yoghurt46,And yet Square didn't make this shit - you did.
kingofgods218,An injustice for all big breasted women and lovers everywhere.
Webonics,What? You guys don't like tits? Give me a break. They're awesome.
JStheKiD,Why does she have Triple F size breasts?  This doesn‚Äôt look right at all. LoL
PrezMoocow,"Really glad they went with a ""sporty girl"" aesthetic for her. This would have been way too distracting and a lil too grossly objectifying. 

Fingers crossed that the infamous ""slap fight"" gets turned into an actual fight and not... whatever the hell it was supposed to be"
remnant_phoenix,The re-design was a definite improvement.
In_trooo,Tiddo Biggies
ScaricoOleoso,Ship it
PotatoTomato52,GAHT DAYUM
My-Len,"this is not correct tho. her white top was up to her collars and no cleavage, and the bottom of the shirt is longer tpp and she had a bra on contrary to this fan edit. 
Dissidia (012 and NT) had one that is close enough
I'm not going to takle the pumping job

(others would be change of face ((position of eyebrows and eye form but that is more style)) or her hair and color of it etc.  but the forcus was clearly on two things... as always *sigh*)"
AlfaBabo,the fmv when ultima weapon wiggles the airship and tifa falls in slowmo... good days
mediocreoldone,"I don't understand how people saw the new Tifa model and didn't see a girl with big boobs. She still has a ridiculous figure. We still get to ogle her plenty. And during the whole Don Cornelio her outfit is pure fan service.

They really didn't make Tifa modest, if anything people have just gotten used to 25 years of outrageous rule 34 Tifa."
Death_Urthrese,god this looks so awful. i'm glad they made the changes they did.
Uzzer_lozer19,Tina putting the double F's in Final Fantasy
Mr_Hugh_Janoses,"Those ain't boobs

 those are B  O  O  B  S"
ThiefLupinIV,I personally liked the look from her concept/instruction book art. Not as exaggerated as this.
TheSclark,It‚Äôs very generous
UltravioIence,"""Do you like it? Its very generous.""

- FF7 creators, probably"
sinkputtbangslut,Big ol biddies
JaySynray,Me likey.
ReptilianLaserbeam,Titsfa
ayegreenguy,"If Barret can have a machine gun for a hand, anything is possible."
Hyperion0203,This is gonna be on gcj so fucking fast
Alarming_Sea_6894,Those tits.
Brimstone-n-Treacle,Those are fake tits. I can tell.
Ice2192,"Tomb Raider: *Accidentally makes Lara‚Äôs boobs huge*
Final Fantasy: ‚ÄúHold my milk!‚Äù"
ADHDmania,I think Tifa's boobs are too big for her fighting style
JANGO-,I LOOOOOOST
Adam_Edward,I saw this lady so much in..certain videos. Today I realised she's a video game character.
Unique-Ad-3443,I remember fighting the end boss on the original took me ages to defeat him still the best ff game imo still remember it to this day need to get this
TheHappyKamper,Tig ol bitties
The_ChineseGoverment,"I know this is stupid, but hear me out. How about we create a character with huge badonkers, and we ""invest"" all of the budget in jiggle physics?"
Bacon_eater8,Can't believe they did all this with one hand!
crissimon,Cloud is a Karen.
Ultra9630,Lord forgive me
troysplay,Sfm porn creators rubbing their hands and licking their lips.
zqipz,__*ENHANCE*__
hardwarecheese,I knew a girl like that in middle school... oh Lisa...
,[deleted]
APlayerHater,Normal ff7 remake tifa already has huge boobs my dude
Not_a_creativeuser,"Downvote me if you want, but I find it really weird people wanted this, and I like cute girls in videogames.. I don't care for what's unrealistic or realistic for someone to wear in videogames, but this straight up looks like an abomination. Tifa as she is now in ff7:re is still unrealistic and her outfit is impractical, but idc I like it and it's appealing... her proportions look good. This tho.. wtaf?"
rentrum,Now direction Italy
Crazed_pillow,"It's ok for some characters to have big boobs, because a lot of women irl do. But it seriously gets over the top sometimes in games"
Ubellord,As a guy even i think that looks and feels uncomfortable
saintjimmy43,Its literally pixels why is my brain like this.
chewbird,Looks horrible
balmy777,Uhhhh
Tridian,"Ok sure, ""accuracy"" is one thing but hear me out...

The new design looks better.

Same thing with Jinx in Arcane, it's a better outfit."
Farm_N3rd502,There will be a whole lot of one-handed players.
ColoursRock,I don't think it's the outfit that caused this.
DarkestDayOfMan,"""Why Tifa... you've enhanced yourself."""
dj-nek0,I‚Äôm not even going to look at the comment and assume there‚Äôs 50 about back issues from people who think they‚Äôre original.
OblongRectum,lol what the fuck
Ill-Organization-719,Good ol days of looking at artwork of Tifa and Aya Brea on RPGamer.
Potato_Octopi,"That looks so awful, lol."
MdT0001,Wonder how her back is holding up after all this time!
anizebra101,The italians really liked this
HairyArthur,That's a really bad back.
whynotll83,imagine if the itailin court saw this or whatever the place was.
