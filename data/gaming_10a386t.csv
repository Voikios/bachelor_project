Download the wallpaper here https://ko-fi.com/itzah"
Xavierr34,we need more sprite-based  MMOs with these graphics.
GodzillaUK,"I've been insanely into the Emerald RomHack ""Emerald Rogue"" which turns Pok√©mon into a roguelite.  So this is extra appreciated, nice work."
deaththegamer666,I want this as my wallpaper but reddit won't let me downloaded it
Stud12,Mudkip gang represent

AdamAptor,This is really beautiful and awesome! What program did you make this in? If you don‚Äôt mind my asking.
BizonSnake,Wow.. Very nice.. if only the game developers at GameFreak would think of adapting such style for future games instead of the bland shit they put out..
Henkorm,Feet
Warmonster9,Is there anyway to set GIFs as a wallpaper on IOS?
njm1314,Are... are there pokemon in those balls cause that seems really negligent. Like they're about to fall and be lost in a watery grave forever.

ATrayYou,Genuine question for people who are into Pok√©mon: do you guys not also get tired of being exposed to it in some form or another multiple times a day for 24 years?
Panez,Lovely piece and colours!
elibou440,Amazing

Vargoroth,"Still remains the best game of the franchise. Some swear by Black/White 2, others by Platinum. For me it remains Emerald."
ImApoopieFartFaceAMA,Was already using your other wallpapers! This will be an awesome edition! Thank you!
Xeath_Pk,Looks amazing but it's hard to use anywhere because of the 1:1 ratio. 16:9 or 16:10 for wallpapers if you want to avoid unsightly black bars or stretched out images.
Lord-Pepper,"I get a legend of Zelda Minish cap vibe from this, my favorite zelda handheld and thats awesome"
NoFeetSmell,This is amazing work.

TheRandyDeluxe,Yo! This is sick!! Is there anyway to turn this from MP4 to a <10 mb gif so I can use it for my discord banner?? I'd pay some good money for that.
StruckBlynde,Emerald best game
DamianNapo,Wow! Made me smile right away. Happy you made this

Tenzin_,"Really beautiful work.  Would love to see a Red/Blue scene in your style, maybe a grassy field in a forest?"
louisi9,"This was my first Pok√©mon game (and really my first video game) and this really brings back memories of playing this every day and night, completing the story and then trying to train a Pok√©mon to as high of a level as possible. 

If this is really OC, thanks, this is the first time I‚Äôve really felt like something is worthy of changing my wallpaper to."
MurmurOfTheCine,Need a Brendan one lol
Evol_Etah,"Love it. But those pokeballs.

Remember that episode where Ash dived to the depths of the ocean to a sunken ship just to rescue a sandshrew in a pokeball scared AF.

All cause they couldn't escape?

Imagine all the pokemon in pokeballs locked in a pokeball.
Unable to escape (I mean they can). If they jump out of the pokeball they drown, die. Suffocate.

Or if burried, will die inside the sand with no escape.

Dude please. Those pokeballs man... Don't put em on the edge.
Add a flying or water Pokemon or just rocks. Anything."
KlokkeMann1,"This makes me genuinely happy and nostalgic back to when i first played this on GameBoy. Such good times, thank you for making this!"
LetterheadRight1389,I‚Äôd love to have this as my phone background it‚Äôs so relaxing.

BeebleDoof,Nice work!
Awkward_Antelope,This brings me so much joy. Thank you!
Internet_Adventurer,Just set this as my phone's animated home screen. I love the look behind my apps
Bandsohard,"This makes me want a Pok√©mon game where you're encouraged to stay in an area for some reason. I guess like how they had bases before but not really.

Maybe like a sprite MMO like someone else said, and you being tied to an area means other trainers going through the game means trainers you encounter along the way are NPC versions of other players in the community. A game from the regular NPC's perspective and you're incentivized to play with their normal in game typings lol, and some random area on a route is your home base and other trainers can encounter you there."
swsplechter,I just wanna live here
Neymarvin,Any more like these of pokemon?
Tedbear567,This is sick
OldFrogHoppins,"Wow, that is beautiful. Congrats. Can you get these as desktop screen savers?"

hunter2mello,I loved that spot and this generation in general.
Kellion,"The sprite art style is what the Pok√©mon franchise needs. A return to it, with modern effects (like this picture) would be great."
Ko5taki,"Very cool, what program did you use to make this? It‚Äôs beautiful."
151Runnin,If a Pokeball is lost are they just damned forever?
chunky_jenn,Why does it look like that took finale fantasy tactics and just put new skins over it lol

Sharteria,"This was the last Pok√©mon game I ever bought and I didn't even beat it.

I just remember the world felt so alive with the Gameboy Advance graphics and I loved the base building. The music also had more depth than the 8 bit stuff on Gen 1 and 2.

Fond memories..."
azzyisbased,I love this I set it as my wallpaper
GarrettFML,Nice work! I really like it! ü©∫

blackvegetables,Dafuc May?! Those pokeballs are 200pkd each and u just leave m on that ridge?

AllanDraven3d,"What a beautiful work of illustration and pixelation, it's too satisfying to look at, if you add a chill song to it, it's already a relaxation therapy... if it's your work, it's really beautiful... üôåüôåüôåüôåüôå"
BrokenEffect,I love the sneaky lotad

laker-prime,There's something very comforting about this...
Yellow_Octopus95,*Feebas noises intesifies*
Crumblycheese,How would the animation work on mobile as a wallpaper? Looks amazing though!
SonicMTD,All I can think about are those poke balls precariously placed‚Ä¶
LonerBoner2145,The art style reminds me of Moonlighter
Dan-the-Man25,This is one of the best wallpapers I've ever seen! Amazing! I love all the subtle details!
DaBees_Knees,I want to enjoy this but the bag and pokeballs sitting on the edge of the waterfall kind of bothers me.
Gladianoxa,I saw this and heard the Littleroot theme immediately. Excellently done.
maimus32,I would pay so much money for a pokemon game to look like that!
Animedingo,You posted this a week ago
GhoulArtist,"I'm in love with pixel art. This is GORGEOUS to me.  But I wonder how much of that is nostalgia. 

Earlier this year a few people younger than me (like 18 something. I'm 36) said that they don't really like it and don't know many their age that do. They elaborated that to them it just looks low quality. 

This shocked me, and made me wonder. Can anyone on the younger side here share their thoughts on it? I'm very curious about this as a culture thing."
Dogs_and_dopamine,Ohmygod I‚Äôm so glad I found you and your work. You‚Äôre so talented!
bikpizza,link to the downloads?
1stshadowx,"They should make a pixel art isometric pokemon game, we all loved the old school pixel ones so clearly going artistic with it would be much more well received over the 3d direction"
kidlatrooster,"Not sure where I remeber seeing this but I think I saw you psoted this too in the art commissions page. 

Loved it then, loved it now :)"
NecRobin,Reminds me of Pok√©mon Dungeon
Spaced27,Why dont they make a pokemon game for us.
Emerald_XO,Hi can you send me download link ?
astrostev,Where do i download lol
safcbullyjr,That‚Äôs really cool
C2Midnight,OP you should x post this to /r/PixelArt

edit: all of your wallpapers are beautiful (the botw one is the best, if i had to choose)"
ManithK,This is beautiful
Mikko420,Beautiful.
MrMcGaming,"Is this the same guy who made the Legend of Zelda pixel art animated wallpaper? This looks a lot like it, and both are phenomenal."
rabed,Is there a way to get the actual animation as a wallpaper on iPhone?
UltimaBahamut93,"Emerald will always be favorite Pokemon game. It has flaws, but it's perfect."
Stunning_Divide_1362,Wow this is dope
I-Like-To-Eat-Rocks,r/SaveVideo
Middle_Actuator7086,"sees mudkip, life good"
RajangRath,I've been rocking this on my phone and gaming computer with wallpaper engine. Really spectacular work!
MatthewTherobloxxer,sooo cute
Zealousideal-Yak-824,To be honest a pixel Pok√©mon game would be great. Invest in the world of it rather then focus on battles. Like a adventure fantasy with different ways to do things and explore. Kinda like pokemon ranger but more independent ai to react to your decisions.
RoofusRoof19,OMG this looks so cutee
makahearts,Bruh. Please can you make these into watch faces too! Good pixel animations are a dime a dozen on those 3rd party apps and they're the cleanest imo
Fair-Perspective-520,thats amazing
Zephyrous318,This is gorgeous! Are you the same person who made the Ocarina of time one? I still use that as my wallpaper!
ThatsSoMetaDawg,INCREDIBLE
loki_pat,"Hey, is this the same wallpaper in wallpaper engine? If so, could you add a pokemon emerald ost, but like, subtle so it won't be copyrighted?"
arson666420,These vibes are so fuckin pleasant!!!üßö‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
dap00man,Best game of the series. Through everything for a loop with team magma and team aqua instead of team rocket. Had the best music in the series. Had the best legendaries and mythicals in the series. And the online meme fest with Groudon versus Kyogre is always hysterical
JollySpaceCowboy,Beautiful
LegendProphecy,totally gives nostalgia. Good ol times indeed.
kerdon,What an enchanting environment
asdfman987,FOR FREE???
Hig13,"This is what I imagine a ""remastered"" gba or gbc game would look like.

Great work!"
HolyBulb,"This is so warm, it makes me sad."
AlasItIsAllForNaught,Wow this is amazing work
