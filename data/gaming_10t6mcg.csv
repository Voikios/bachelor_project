fartemous_foul,"It's fine, someday I'll be dead and it'll all be fine."
Mercurial8,This is exactly why I don‚Äôt use a PlayStation controller.
zipflop,"""Nothing better to do"" = ""Ignoring more productive and valuable activities and avoiding responsibilities of my home and life to instead wallow in my own self-pity and undeserved sense of despair.""

Me."
Gabeko,If thats the case maybe you just outgrew gaming or need a break. Im 30 and damn do i still enjoy videogames
aaronalation,These comments are depressing as hell.
iskin,This is what happens after you push the other 3 buttons and realize X is broken.
Dan_Zfr,I see your point but you cannot hide the fact that is hard and unadulterated Copium
beattraxx,"I dunno why people think that gaming is a waste of time. 

As long as you are happy playing games, keep on doing them and stop comparing you with others. 

Im 29, single for I think 5 years now, gaming since I was 4 and still doing it. 

Yes, a new GF would be cool and all but I am happy where I am rn. 

Gaming is a huge part of my life, my biggest hobby and I am in no rush in getting a family anytime soon. 

&#x200B;

IF you really struggle finding other hobbies just try stuff out you can do at home 

I have depression, 2022 was the worst year of my life (almost ended it) and to get myself at least a bit out of this shithole I started making music, as a complete beginner with no knowledge whatsoever. 

Its super hard but the reward when I keep doing it for some years is fucking worth it for me

&#x200B;

If you need someone to talk/vent to just hmu."
Kozzzman,"WoW, Reddit, Hearthstone, IG. All day, everyday and I hate all of them."
BishopsHouse,"""Sir why did you start a crusade over this picture?""

  
Because I'm in it and I don't like it."
Left_Share3227,Wait I‚Äôm not the only one
available_username2,I have a family and good job and it doesn't really change anything
ithepunisher,"Well, Of Course I Know Him. He's Me."
-KKD-,"I would have started a family, if it was just pressing a button, but in reality it's kinda hard, even finding a girl is hard"
Fatzombiepig,"Too real, far too real :("
Lonely_Happy_Boy,"Same. Modern life sucks. 

In the past you had to work harder but at least you weren't this hellish bored/depressed combination that you are now.

And you didn't have the internet so you were probably religious which added meaning to what is now known as a meaningless existence."
KryptoGrinder,Imma start spamming X
RageTiger,I cannot see any difference between X and O on this one.
zultan3,I don't give a damn of starting a family.  the same about finding a prestigios job. I'm happy playing video games.   so what?   I wonder why people who don't play games must always judge people who do calling them losers.  Just go and stay with your happy family without bothering others.
zenkaiba,I did square .....much worse ngl
themagicdonut2,Gotta stay on the grind for that LEGENDARY LOOT MA BOY
Waywardsteps,Is that why triangles are heavy attacks? Squares light? And X for traversal?  Damn. There‚Äôs a lesson in there somewhere. A metaphor. A philosophy. *continues scrolling phone* anyway!
SV-STARKILLER,Depression says hello.
lost_james,Who‚Äôs paying the bills?
AlonelyChip,"This is literally me. I just play video games or watch anime in College, cause I have nothing better to do. (Besides homework and such). But it's gotten to a point where even video games get boring, and don't want to seek any other hobbies because all the hobbies that I can come up with also sound boring, and probably will leave me to regret it later on. Also in order for me to have fun with an activity I have to be good at it, so taking up new hobbies is pointless, cause I'll just get super frustrated and angry that I am not already good at it"
SomeDudeWithALaptop,2 and a half hours into my session and I feel attacked. I'm going back to bed.
HisSnakeIsSolid,"Lieutenant, I'm having depression."
Automatic_Animal,8 hours? Those are rookie numbers.
Armetron,"I use to ‚óØ all the time

I was starting to work on ‚ñ≥ however the tech layoffs happened

elkeiem,"Speak for yourself, i get more enjoyment out of games as i've grown older."
bobthepetferret,"A lot of you all really need to seek help

Please do so"
VelociLeo,"That's sad. I have a good job, a family, am happy and still play video games."
ngh2b,"I've come to term with the fact that, while I love gaming, it's become a coping mechanism to not have to deal with the world.

And it's frankly putting me further behind.

I'm still gaming, just not nearly as much as before, and it's really quite freeing.

It's a virtual drug in the end. Time to admit it."
McBeano72,It is a strange existence isn't it? Our ancestors would likely see this as a godless dystopian hell lol
PasqualeThe3rd,Go get a job
Lerouxed,Bread and circuses. Look it up.
NattLilly,Welcome to late stage capitalism.
Fathoms-Under,What most single guys would choose right now. Including me.
neurotichoe,"I'm really starting to understand that sentiment ""Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing."" A lot of the time, people are ok with playing games for extended periods of time and it's their passion. I respect that a lot, but I don't think it's good for me personally... just kind of based on my needs. Everyone's different! Nothing wrong with realizing that :)"
SweetList,"I can do X and O at the same time, but not without interest"
KyorlSadei,O is so normal to me
Dannyboy765,Not cool man
xVolt_,Hello darkness my old friend
artifex28,"The trick is to play games that you are interested in.

SadGayLady,"Back into the loop of question.

Is it video game addiction and laziness, or is it depression?"
BirdieBronze,Yup
goodnewzevery1,I have pressed all these buttons and you can too!
SirWhatsalot,"Why only one, I button mashed and do all four.

No not so much about the apps and memes though. If I notice that I am ""accidentally"" in an app or ""accident"" spend too much time on one, I temporarily uninstall it."
airforcevet1987,O X  üü•  üî∫Ô∏è in that order for me.
depressome,"Me, but I keep cycling between 4-5 news websites instead of video games."
lordquiggs77,I personally would smash triangle..ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
ShrankNutz,"1.) Triangle is definitely out of the question for me, I got a vasectomy. And adopting costs anywhere between $20,000-$50,000.

2.) Square is definitely not a primary focus right now, as I am debt free, my job pays me a decent wage, and my living situation is stable and acceptable.

I spend a solid majority of my days pressing X, but here and there, pressing Circle is just downright enjoyable.

As you get older, and as the video game industry changes, they begin to lose the magic that was mostly noticeable when you're young and easily addicted to shit. It's nice to go out and enjoy nature, explore hobbies, and learn something new. But i also love it when i randomly decide to pick up the Joy-Cons after having not touched them for months and get re-addicted to Animal Crossing. Or forgetting that you made a new character in Elden Ring and attempting to beat Malenia for the 100th time. Video games will always hold a special place in my heart, ever since the first time i played A Link to the Past in 1997."
SalKedavra91,-agrees in ADHD-
Slaptain_Crunch,Just mash all the buttons with you palm
BLACKCH0C0B0,"Absolutely üò§

Natural-Nectarine-49,still better than starting a family. believe.
jjday,"If this is you, it‚Äôs never too late to break the cycle ! Mix things up!"
Mystalzia,Sounds relaxing and stress free to me. I‚Äôll take it üòÇ

murfi,If that's what you do 8 hours a day that means you are loaded af.
wwzd,"I realized I spent way too much time gaming and I didn't even enjoy it anymore. So I stopped and began doing more productive tasks/hobbies. It's been months now, no regrets."
ricebasedvodka,Wow didn't expect to be attacked like this today
Dangerous-Pickle9511,Everything but x for me
boredofshit,"Stop being so nihilistic ya cunt. Just be happy doing one of the top three things. Or more than one, boom, problem solved. Button mashing works in life too."
Fungidude,Pressed all the buttons.
RetroBastardo,"Last year was the one year I lost total interest in video games and everything else, I went thru hell mentally but believe it or not playing 8ball pool on my iphone kickstarted my recovery lol  next thing was starting to play COD and it felt great again. I was at the point of needed sleeping meds or anti drepressants. Video games while not a cure to depression they help in keeping your mind off your problems and after a while your problems slowly go away."
SkyWizarding,I pressed triangle by mistake
BackgroundHorse7135,what is his name and number?
stiegosaurus,I love how start a family and being happy are two different options haha. Facts.
hoowahman,Why am I all these buttons in some way
mmdanmm,"Damn looks like a found the cheatcode for pressing all buttons, I work the minimum and play games/tend the garden all day, been at it for 15 years now."
IrrelevantTale,I like how be happy is a button. Like you guys have a choice?
RavioliDecoy,Just ESPN 100m dash that shit
Ted1590,the fact that these are all seperated implies you cannot have any of the two together... oof
LookoutImpossible30,I choose. O
Merciless972,"As someone who grew up on playstation, and now plays on switch and x box controller on PC. I'm going to keep pressing circle unintentionally."
teefal,"Fixed it for you (or me)...

Start a family = Spend time with your family

Prestigious = more rewarding

Memes = reddit posts

Nothing better to do = Nothing left in your soul

-------

What are the criteria for ""prestigious""?   And if you qualify, what's the personal payoff (besides money)?"
MidnightWidow,I enjoy video games still lol and I always did even when I was younger. Some games have profound stories and I have more of a social setting playing games with friends over watching TV.
ipianomantann,Circle is the only option that doesn‚Äôt get downvoted on Reddit
SuperToxin,We all die anyway might as well enjoy yourself. Game on.
Ark125,Maybe I should take up reading again. I think I will.
Nonex359,"Followed by : Try to do something productive, jerk off insteasd because it takes to much effort, take a nap because now you're bored AND tired, wake up later in the evening, start gaming again because why waste all your post nap clarity on being productive, spend the next few hours gaming like its your job because you have nothing better to do, go to bed because you're tired from staring at a screen all day, jerk it before going to sleep because why waste the oppurtunity, go to sleep, wake waaay earlier than is necessary to spend more time gaming, repeat cycle"
Tw1stedDimensions,"üî∫Ô∏è ‚¨õÔ∏è üîµ !
Oh shit the X button is broken."
TheIncarnated,"Triangle, Square, Circle.

Sometimes, sometimes X."
Grimmdarkus,"To be fair a lot of the people I know who did start families are miserable because they don't really love their spouses and just did it out of a sense of obligation and/or loneliness.  And I've had a ""prestigious job"", it was horribly overrated.  The more money you get paid the more bs you have to deal with and the less secure you are in your position.  And sure, everyone would pursue ""happiness"" if only we knew what that was."
newgildedage,The sad part is that this refers to me way more than anyone else in here guaranteed. Unless you've been homeless for more than 3 years consecutively like me.
FlowingMochi,What qualifies as a ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù job?
hellxapo,"Sad for many, but true."
johnmarkfoley,Stop spying on me
Medium_Rest3537,If I could hit a button that makes me happy I would???
X420StepsAheadX,pretty sure i can press that x at the same time
Tyrantkv,"I mash all four rapidly with glee. Seriously, turning 40 this month, married, home owner, we have a wonderful kid. We all game as a family and independently and discuss along the way. I know, but I I like to offer the counter to these gamer sob stereotypes. Gaming doesn't stop you from having anything, it just adds to your life. If everything else is failing, you'll find something or someone to blame. Git gud"
diamondboltistheshit,how nostalgic
killbots94,All four things can  happen consecutively.  Being at a different point in your life doesn't guarantee happiness. Make the best of your life right now and enjoy it however you find a way.
Richiieee,26 years of life on this planet and **O** is all that I can muster the energy to do.
sathucao,The X button is broken otherwise I would have pressed X
Maximum_Hand_9362,"Hehehe reddit, 9gag and yotube shorts"
Nero096,"This post is completely nosense.

1: Starting a family isn't something you could do in one day. You have to be 1000% sure that you're able to do it. You need a strong and working relationship. Do you really wish the best for your children? Or you want them to grow up in a family full of problems?

2: The same goes for the job thing. It takes time. I had to change 4 jobs before finding the right one.

3: Be happy... are you kidding right? Everyone finds happiness in a different way, some people struggle more, some less. But what makes ME happy won't probably make YOU happy.  
And the point is the same. Happiness is not something you'll find in a day. You have to know yourself.

Also... if I play a game that doesn't interest me, I get instantly bored i and I uninstall It. 

Sorry, but this post doesn't apply at all for me."
Lgtsrf326,That guy looks like Rick
Speedstar900,I feel offended
smashing-boob,Reddit is nothing but losers. People need to get out get married get a good job and have a family. Place is a cesspool of basement dwellers with nothing to look forward to.
only_for_dst_and_tf2,"O is the easiest, all the others are deciptively complex

""be happy""

how the fuck am i supposed to do that?

""find a presigious job""

and? then what?

""start a family""

and give myself something im not competent to be responsibal for? no thanks."
leto369,True!!!
todang,Im 12 and this is deep.

CrispyRif,This reality is broken. I need a new one
Skanach,"Anyway, you can't have two of them at the same time."
Vindalltv,"Sometimes for some people doing O can equal X. Not sure what the value of ""prestigious job"" provides. Why do we have to be prestigious? We can just be happy. It's not 1950 anymore people can define themselves by what they love and what they think, not what they do for a profession. 

Just my 2 cents. 

Itll get better one day my dudes!"
Milk_man1337,"I certainly had this moment in my life, I used to play lots of games like League and Dota etc.
They made me miserable, everyone pro made me want to play harder and better but it was just a very large time sink that ultimately made me mostly unhappy.

I have up wholly on those, and will no longer let myself play them.
I now only really play FFXIV for raiding (savage & Ultimate) with a static and have a backlog list I have categorised and spend my Friday and Saturday nights playing them.
I stick to 1 game and don't move on until I determine I don't like it enough to finish or I have finished it.
I really don't play much outside of that.
I'm 29, have a mortgage and want to have kids so I did a bit of work to make sure my life balance was healthy.

I don't reckon many people will quite understand this part but whilst I don't game as much as I used to, I actually found that mentally I was able to gamify online shopping and really enjoy it.
It kind of made me feel like all the time I spent gaming wasn't useless after all.
I started learning all the hidden tricks and tools that are available to everyone that you don't really know about it until you do a bit of research.

I tend to subconsciously make a game of it, find something I want and see how big a discount I can get and how many reward points etc I can stack per purchase.
I realised that since I've been gaming for so long *im really fucking good at it* and applying that mindset to something that provides me a useful, tangible benefit makes it feel so much better."
