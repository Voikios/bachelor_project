{"Title": "Tarkov has lost a raider...", "Post Text": "**To BSG, Nikita Buyanov, and the Tarkov community:**\n\nIt is with great sadness I write to inform you that Escape From Tarkov has lost a true and honest raider. I found out recently that a close friend of mine passed away in a motorcycle accident last month just before the holidays. I was told that he was most likely wearing his helmet, but that unfortunately he suffered severe brain hemorraghing that necessitated him being put in a medically-induced coma. Ultimately, the doctors were unable to stop the bleeding and he was unresponsive, so they officially called it on the 23rd of December. He was surrounded by friends and family when he passed. He was a loving and compassionate friend who loved animals and dreamed of starting his own food truck business. He wanted to be his own boss, and he loved golf, music festivals, sports, and playing Escape From Tarkov.\n\nMy friend is the person who got me into Escape From Tarkov. Him, myself, and a number of others over the past year and a half or so bonded over the internet and in person, playing video games like Red Dead Online, DayZ, Escape From Tarkov, etc. Some of the others in this group knew of or had played Tarkov, including one buddy who is an Alpha-armband account who played and grinded Tarkov many late nights together with our friend long before any of the rest of us had met. (They originally met on a Twitch streamer's chat, I believe. Perhaps this friend will join us here to share some memories as well in the comments.) But, he loved Tarkov and played it far and beyond others in the group, often staying in the group Discord with us and only occasionally exclaiming \"Oh, I'm dead.\" or \"Oh shit!\" as he raided while others chatted or played different games--just so he could hang out with us. After hours spent in Discord together, talking and getting to know one another, he asked me if I'd ever heard of or thought of playing the game. I said I knew one or two people who had played very early in its release besides our mutual friends, but had never really thought much about it, and he told me straight up he knew it was a game I would find something in. Let me tell you, he was right. I have just recently exceeded 1400 hours playtime as of this wipe.\n\nEscape From Tarkov was, without a shadow of a doubt, his favorite game. He said so only all of the time, and to just about anyone who asked about or mentioned the game. He often would say that, for the money he spent on an E.O.D. account, he got back a thousandfold the value out of the fun and entertainment he had playing the game for countless hours on end.\n\nHe was a true raider. He was the picturesque Chad described by the Tarkov community at large. The Chad you aspire to be, the Chad someone is raging about in the post-raid menu, the Chad receiving angry friend requests and lengthy, creatively misspelled and vulgar messages, the Chad who is about to (head, eyes) you on Factory, the Chad who sniped you from on top of Sniper Rock while you're trying to task in the Lumbermill, the Chad who pushed your shit in on three-story Dorms. He wasn't a Chad in the always-meta-gear 24/7 grindset, archetypal way, he didn't grind the game to excess or exploit. He was a Chad in his skills, his actions, his mannerisms, and his playstyle. He was lightning fast, smart, he had a good instinct, and he was quick to start and end any gunfight. He was the type of person whose PMC had more \"Kill Experience\" than \"Survival\" or \"Loot\" in his career stats. This guy left bodies behind that even crows wouldn't have dared to pick through. He killed every boss on the pre-wipe event in a single raid when they all spawned on Customs, and several PMCs besides. He was the kind of Chad the Russian Boyars of yon would have sang songs about and toasted a round of spirits to over a campfire. The man was a warrior.\n\nAnd he had a mouth on him that was backed up by everything else he had going for him. I remember one time at the start of that wipe when noises were added to dropping guns, we were in Crackhouse on Customs when a guy came up the scaffolding and stood at the top of the stairway to second floor behind the closed door. My friend was above in the office at the other end of the hall, and when I called out the dude coming he VOIPs to him: \"Hey buddy. I know you're out there. So I'm going to make it real simple for you. Either you walk away, or you can come in here and I kill you.\" The next thing you hear is the sound of the PMC opening the door and a single shot ringing out from down the hall, and then the clattering of the PMC's gun dropping and banging down the metal stairs with nigh comedic effect. That's all it took.\n\nHe was a funny guy and the in-raid antics were not shy to come out at times. He had no shortness of quips and his style would often drive players into some form of deranged madness local to Tarkovers, a syndrome some reading this may have encountered before. For a long time, he would stream while playing, with your stereotypical \\_TTV suffix username, but only so that people he killed could come into his stream and bitch at him. He loved that shit. He ate it up like you were giving the man free steak dinners. Once at the start of my first wipe we went to get Unknown Key from off the dead body behind the trailers at RUAF, and he killed some poor soul who had come along probably to do the same thing... and when the guy joined his Twitch chat and started giving him an earful about \"honor\" and \"camping the quest spot\" and demanded that he drop the sap's dogtags, my friend responded by stopping midraid, going into his inventory, inspecting the guy's tags, and then, twirling them around, said \"Oh, you mean these tags? I don't know... I really like 'em. I think I'm just gonna keep them.\" *Hahaha!*\n\nSeriously, when I say this guy loved Tarkov and embodied the spirit of the game, I mean it. He understood the axiom of Tarkov and relished it. He was the first person to say to me, \"I play every raid like I am already dead. That way, when I die, I already saw it coming. And, if I don't die, well, then that's a good raid, brother.\" He was great at the game but also realistic about it. He could always immerse himself in the world that Battlestate Games has created and find something cool or awesome about it, solo or with others. He was always down to raid. He truly loved this game, so much.\n\nWe have surely lost a valiant and epic raider, friends. It breaks my heart that some of the last things we exchanged words over was about the coming of this most recent wipe. He was so excited for Streets, and even though it was going to be a buggy messpile he didn't care, he knew full well and said that it didn't matter to him if it came out bad because it was the first step towards it being good. I know he was so psyched for Arena also. He had the best attitude and he was just a great guy to be around. I can't believe he is gone.\n\nHis friends and family will miss him dearly. The tribe of people whose lives he touched online and in the real world will be forever changed by him, and his passing is mourned with no shortness of solemnity and sorrow. It is only fair and really an honor to be the one to tell you all--this part of his life--that, sadly, he has harrowed the journey and suffered the travails of this world, and has moved on to a better place.\n\nAfter calling friends in our online circle to share the bad news, to clear my head I went on a long walk around my city. I cried and went through a lot of thoughts on that walk. I can't express in any real, concrete way the content of those thoughts, or even describe much about the walk itself, but as anyone who has lost someone close to them knows, the grief and denial that set in was hard to process even for someone who has always accepted death for what it is, and come to learn and understand death since childhood. But as I made my way along and through the streets as the sun set and the dusk fell, I came across a mural on the side of a building that once housed a much-loved caf\u00e9 in town that closed down a couple years ago. And on the old marquee, someone from the closing of the caf\u00e9 had left the words:\n\n>\"Nothing Lasts Ever  \n>  \n>Goodbye\"\n\n...\n\nGoodbye, brother. You will be sorely missed and always remembered. Now when I tell myself in the raid, after the firefight, that there's always another one, there's always someone who has got me in their crosshairs--even when there isn't--I will play like it's you hunting me. Godspeed.\n\n**-- Note to the reader:** Thank you for taking the time to read this, even just some of it. You matter, and this game is fucking awesome! Never let anyone tell you differently and never tell yourself you can't get better. You will always get better and there is always success waiting for us to discover it in our failures and in our darkest hours there is light. Be well and have good raids this wipe. And shoot some guy for my boy who's gone now and yell \"Welcome to Tarkov, you beautiful bastard!\" when you do.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgFkmRvzdHI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgFkmRvzdHI)", "ID": "10krv7s", "Score": 2952, "Total Comments": 268, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10krv7s/tarkov_has_lost_a_raider/"}
