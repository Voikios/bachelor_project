Pholusactual,"If this is the first priority they had I think it's funny as shit they didn't mention it when campaigning -- they were pissing and moaning about how crime was out of control and inflation was ruining them and immigration was a threat to the nation.

They get in and their first priority is not to fix the supposed crises but instead they rush to remove any accountability mechanisms they might run afoul of.

There is no other conclusion than Republicans are lowlife scum and trash."

gogojack,"I don't think it was intentional, but the nexus of Santos and the vote to gut the ethics office is peak GOP at this point.

Think about it.  They have a near-perfect test case.  A newly minted Congressman who lied about literally everything.  I'm not convinced he's even from the district, or even New York.

He's at once a nobody and everybody.  If he stays in office even after everything that's come out, they've won.  They can run someone who has no qualifications, no qualms about lying, there's no mechanism for holding him responsible, and if the voters are okay with it?

It's a win-win. If they pull this off, they will never have to answer to anyone ever again."

What are they talking about? Apparently some classified documents were found at some Biden Institute in Pennsylvania? Headline compares it to Trump's documents thing, but the actual article, their own article, reports that the find was immediately reported to the records office and the documents returned shortly after... which is what people are supposed to do when classified documents get misplaced.

So, yeah. They don't even have an excuse for this Congressional Ethics Office thing. They're too busy still trying the ""no u"" defense."

Heijoshinn,"So the purported playbook is:

> put forward by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy

With Republicans agreeing to:

> re-imposes eight-year term limits for the OCE's board members, made up of former members of Congress

And...

> The practical effect of that will be the immediate removal of three of four Democratic-appointed board members

With a side effect of...

> rules prevent the office from hiring new staff after one month and require four board members to sign off on any staffing decision

But the current ethics body...

> *operates independently* of Congress and has *generally been more effective at investigating* wrong-doing than [self-policing Ethics Committee in the House or Senate](https://www.businessinsider.com/january-6-senate-ethics-complaint-josh-hawley-ted-cruz-unsettled-2022-12)

And Santos says...

> ""I think it just gives them more power,"" he said. He added that the newly-imposed rules wouldn't ""allow people to sit there without term limits,"" apparently referring to the board members. ""I believe in term limits.""

He believes in term limits on committee members; the same members that are dedicated to investigating congressional job performing fallacies. Because of the general political slogan of...

> ""I believe in term limits.""

Yet...

> He also brushed off the staffing restrictions, saying it would allow ""new members of the board to *pick their discretionary members*""

Again, put forward by Republicans. I can't help but wonder if they'll try replacing those Democratic seats with Republican ones in order to consolidate party power further. Hm.  

And **his** comically **hypocritical conclusion** is:

> ""It's a **good** thing **for transparency**, it's a good thing for Americans,"" 

Even though this article injects some opinion in it's writing, Santos' duck-face can unconsensually get anally knuckle busted.

Ethics advisors to the Prime minister kept resigning after refusing to approve proposals that broke international law. Until the Conservatives just never appointed a new one for 6 months.

Finally a new one has been appointed, a staunchly tory banker. In addition he is no longer to investigate the government anyway, so the position has basically been disbanded.
