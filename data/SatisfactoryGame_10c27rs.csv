From behind them a large spider-like creature emerges. Arthur quickly impales the creature but a dozen more emerge from all around. The pair flees deeper into the tunnels but the creatures are gaining on them. Then they hear a soft ""thump"" followed by a deafening explosion. The creatures had all been killed. A stout figure with an enormous beard emerges from a darkened passage. He raises a pickaxe above his head and shouts at Prince Arthur ""ROCK AND STONE"".
