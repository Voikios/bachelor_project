chrisb736,"It breaks. Immediately all the machines turn off, the planet wide silence is deafening until the elevator detaches and is pulled back into orbit. Then ADA in your ear. 

ADA: ‚ÄúDestruction of Ficsit property detected, Contract and Employment terminated due to breach of contract. 

See page 6945, paragraph 5, ‚ÄúWasteful actions such as the destruction of 
Ficsit equipment is grounds for immediate termination‚Äù. 

Please enter HUB and wait for further instructions in no less than, 9999999 days. ‚Äú

You wait for a few days, trying to make contact. But your alone. So you find a way to Hotwire the HUBs Drop Pod. 

It works, your blasting to space. Until a single shot take you out of the sky. Another drop pod to little the ground Just another hard drive to a future Engineer. 


In the distance you you see it as your vision fade to black, another single seater drop pod entering the atmosphere. They don‚Äôt waste no time. Be efficient."
