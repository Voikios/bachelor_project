Florida_Mayn,"I agree! Also, listen to the whole intro. It gives you power."
bigtiddygothbf,"I'm honestly hoping they keep most, if not all the current mechanics for full release

I'm down for giving the systems more depth, adding new content, but marauders is so much simpler than some other extraction shooters.  The maps are easy to memorize, with the small corridor design on most maps making it very easy to orient yourself.  Crafting is just complex enough to motivate me to engage with it, and gives you decent milestones to know what kind of gear you're expected to be bringing based on your level.  Gear is easy to understand, guns deal x damage and armor reduces damage by y, if I see higher level gear I can just glance at it and know it's good.  Loot spawns are consistent, easy to identify, and are in spots which make sense.

I got burned out on tarkov after maybe 10 hours of trying, but I felt like I needed to study spreadsheets to really know what was going on.  With marauders it's way easier to just hop on, have a decent time, and stop playing whenever."
Silverdonut21,"I always wanted to get into Tarkov but it always seemed more complicated than I was willing to get into. Iâ€™m loving Marauders so far though, more enjoyable than I was expecting."
MediocreCowboi,This game will be great if they add a reconnect feature or fix the constant crashing
FGCRandom,"I also really enjoy the game. It's like a combination of Tarkov and an mmo named Star Citizen with a World War setting. But WAY LESS complicated than those games, but it's not a walk in the park either. Even the A.I. can be confused with a player of how they behave to noise, they can duck or even lean. And the combat it's not just rushing and shooting. Even if your enemy has a pistol, it's not a clear who might end up winning. 

I always enjoy games that take the ww times and add something to it or at least a setting similar to the 1940s. Like waw zombies or Resistance Fall of Man or Wolfenstein the New Order (specially the first level)

I would love if they could add a physical place that you can upgrade and you can view your ships like Tarkov has it's hideout, Cycle: the frontier has the room or Vigor has you settlement. I place that you can care about and craft more than just things you can lose (like weapons, armor or ships).

Sorry for my grammar and mispells. English is not my first language"
VidraiderBros,Hell yea man! Glad you're enjoying it :) it's really a fantastic game and I can't wait to see the more the add!
Arcanu,"I really like it aswell. Would be cool if you could build a base and upgrade it over time and the base becomes the lobby. This already works in the space dwarf game with mining... forgot the name... ROCK AND STONE...
AND MINING PLEASE T_T I want to mine asteroids."
AlwaysSecret,"See, I got this game cause I had a need for a survival shooter like Tarkov. 

I SUCKED at Tarkov, and I would get so stressed playing it. This game allows me to not only have fun, but also learn how to manage weapons, inventory, craft ingredients, etc. And even on your worst stretch of runs, you always have opportunities to actually get out, grab stuff and come back rich af. (Seriously I have developed a hoarding problem my inventory is so packed I have to play tetris to organize stuff to sell and which to stuff in my bags)

This game has bugs yeah, sometimes I feel stressed but I never felt the anger and fury I felt playing Tarkov while playing Marauders.

The game play loop is awesome and I REALLY REALLY hope that with bugs and balance adjustments we get more content and station maps because this game is super fucking fun and I play it almost daily."
LokiBoi9000,fantastic game yes. my only problem was that for some reason I got booted out of a match for no reason other than I think the anti-cheat thought I was cheating because I killed a guy from mid-range with the liberator. I killed the guy and poof back to the main menu I go. I lost all my crap and I'm a newer player so it kinda fucked with me.
Noobnoobthedude,I suck so much at this game. But I love it.
