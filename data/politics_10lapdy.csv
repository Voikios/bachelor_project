IphtashuFitz,As well they should.
Tomservoux5,DeSantis is a masks off racist. At least he made it easy for us to see who and what he is.
antigonemerlin,"Students may not have any power, but they sure have a lot of angry parents who can be turned against the governor for interfering with their child's chances of getting into college.

I have a feeling he may be hoisted by his own petard."
aka_r4mses,This dudes off to a hell of a start if he wants to be President.  Piss off every black American voter?  Check.
Nate-doge1,"Purging the intellectuals and targeting minority scapegoats at the same time. Really speedrunning the fascist playbook, Florida."
alfredandthebirds,"[Here’s a link](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23584340/ap-afam-syllabus-watermark.pdf) to the actual AP program 

I skimmed through it all. Seems like a great course. DeSantis is a loon."
bcorm11,"This isn't exactly a meritless case. By not allowing this AP class Desantis is putting Florida's students at an educational disadvantage for college acceptance. Students taking AP classes are already in heavy competition for scholarships and grants to attend top tier schools, this puts Florida's students behind the rest of the country because their governor, government and majority of the voting population don't know what Critical Race Theory is. Until it was co-opted to mean anything conservatives want it to, it was a graduate and Law School level class."
Slight_Award8124,A class action class action?!
Big-D-TX,So I hope all of Florida’s retires are happy they have a White Supremest leading them.
Bobbybigdumps,Cool I’ll just add black people to the list of things Desantis hates. Right behind gay people and the US constitution. Ron Desantis is a nazi
Okbuddyliberals,"Well, I doubt that will work or make any difference whatsoever... but I sympathize with them and hope they prove my immense pessimism wrong"
SilentRidge,"The Republican party is a racist party.  You can't argue otherwise.

Also, he is caked in more spraytan in this photo than 2016 era Trump."
Ok_Ninja_1602,"If kids want to study their ancestry or others that have significantly influenced American culture and history they should be able to. Honestly it's a shame that it's separate because regular American history glosses over achievements of African Americans, the homage is superficial at best."
commanderlex27,The kids are alright.
bob-the-dragon,Personally I think such studies should be incorporated into regular history lessons. Having it a separate thing gives the impression that African Americans are a separate class of people and have a separate history. Black history is American history.
redstarjedi,Ron De-Suck-Ass as Matt Christman would say.
Guccimayne,"Republicans have turned CRT into the next ""Sharia law"" scare, smfh"
SurgeDad,They won't regret it and history will forever remember their bravery.
TheBelhade,The kids are all right.
LeJusesCrust,"Why even make the threat? Why not just sue? If threatening to sue and actually suing result in a headline and the same odds of winning the suit, then the threat seems like a waste. I’d imagine there’s be enough support to help pay for the legal fees."

WorldWideWhit,I support the students.
serarrist,"Please do it. Please do it. 

The kids are fucking amazing. I am so proud to see the GOP’s attempt at indoctrination is failing on them. 

It’s really sad that they’re having to fight for their right to a real education. How are Floridians not embarrassed?"
nuffced,This is one racist motherfucker.
Onehansclapping,You know your doing something wrong when your constituency sues you.
Serendipatti,"Wannabe King DeSantis is one of the most, if not the most, dangerous politicians in the country."
teej_watches_listens,Do it. Rake that fat Nazi bastard over the coals. Expose his racism.
KimKarTRASHian09,He looks like he’s turning orange. That’s no surprise
drones4thepoor,Floridians are losing their home insurance because climate change is making the state uninhabitable and this clown is afraid of black history.
Fair_Ad_2714,"Republican version of Black American history:

Africans came on a cruise to America, where they decided to work for European immigrants in America for free. The Africans loved what they saw in their new homeland that they embraced a new religion, a new language. The African ladies who worked for free would occasionally get pregnant by their European male boss, their offspring was treated with dignity and humility that they got to live inside the bosses home and not with other Africans who worked for free and lived with the farm animals.

OtmShanks55,desantis is a racist bigot. There is a no way around it.
Erazerhead-5407,This new generation of upcoming adults seem to have the tenacity and determination to change things for the better. I applaud their efforts. Stand up for your rights and never yield.  Knowledge has never been a detriment to mankind. It’s the withholding of knowledge that stops progress from moving forward.
Fine_Big_5147,"There’s no reason for this. He’s simply racist. Banning African American studies, knowing that African Americans attend these schools is basically him saying fuck them and their history."
jayfeather31,"I'm on their side here, but I have severe doubts that they'll succeed."
FUMFVR,It really confuses me where him or the state school board get the authority to do such a thing. They didn't even cite any law or point to 'objectionable' material when they rejected it. They just did it like the authoritarian thugs they are.
murkey-depth,Well good lord they should!  It's okay to teach white history but not black history?  What the fucking fuck?
Wonderful_Soft_170,"Is anyone really surprised? I mean this is the same man who rejected updated math books for Florida students because apparently it was too ""woke"""

raltoid,"Do it. 

He doesn't give two shits about what actually happens, he got the message out to his voters that he is willing to do it, and that's all they care about."
Neapola,"Don't threaten.  That's what DeSantis wants.  He wants empty threats and free press from outrage-driven news coverage.

Don't threaten to do it.  **DO IT.**"
TimBeckwith,"Maybe im just ignorant to things like this, but what is the point of blocking a course of study like this?"
hoops_n_politics,"Ron DeSantis is going to spend the next 12 months using Florida’s tax payer dollars to virtue signal to the national GOP base while he waits for Donald Trump to commit to his election campaign.  This guy is a slick politician and chameleon, and will do or say anything to further his political ambition at the national level.  Meanwhile, in actuality he’s a glorified used car salesman."
beyond_hatred,Republicans need to learn to stay in their lane.  Go back to giving rich people money and making it easier to pollute the environment.
KyndallT,"Don't threaten, do it."
Blankmanman,"I live in Florida, and I can't stand this little shit fuck of a governor."
AnonSwan,What is the reason for banning it?
Hungry_Awareness_843,"The Republican governor said that he supports banning the course being offered to some high school students because its lessons delve too far into political agendas, broaching topics such as queer studies and abolishing prisons. Black officials in the state, from Democratic lawmakers to faith leaders, however, are seeking to overturn the DeSantis administration’s determination that the class “significantly lacks educational value.”"
80sKidCA,He looks like an oompa loompa
bastardhousecat,Nobody's gonna forget how he fucked everyone on unemployment during covid.
TheAllegedGenius,This is no time for threats. If these people have the capability to sue (like the lawyers and money needed to do so) they should.
GeauxGeauxGadget504,"I’m no expert but isn’t this what R’s want? 

They take office, do terrible stuff, then the office gets blamed for it. Either painting a picture that government is bad or draining state funding because the state was sued. 

Again-NOT AN EXPERT HERE. I’m all for action and this Ron guy sucks eggs but I feel like we gotta start shifting from “opposition is going to take legal action” to “opposition is going to UNSEAT.”"
Typical-Annual-3555,Time for the important question. Is he jaundiced? Is that makeup?
achinwin,"What the actual proposed class actually was is a mystery, but the provided reasoning by FL DOE is questionable — it definitely sounds political."
Gottapopemall,As long as it’s an elective and it isn’t some sort of indoctrination or world view- basically kids are free to discuss their viewpoints and opinions - why the fuck would you try to censor history. This is ridiculous.
Acceptable_March_701,"Ok, nice attempt at gaslighting. If a child wishes to further their education in black history, then this curriculum would be what they receive. I don't know if that falls under your definition of mandated or not."
SmartWonderWoman,I hope they win BIG!
tmzspn,His anti-woke bullshit was supposed to prevent the “indoctrination” of elementary school children. Looks like that premise lasted about six months.
quest-to-know,Ron DeSantis hates truth and freedom.
EfficientTank8443,"How is ""High School students threaten to sue"" in the news?"
HectorsMascara,"Maybe they still need ditch-diggers in Florida? But 21st Century adults who don't know how to learn and adapt, and who aren't capable of introspection and empathy are just more dead weight, at best."
DragonsThatFly,I absolutely hate this entire situation. That I have to side with College Board of all companies because my senator doesn't care about African Americans
SomeNoteToMyself,Conservative subs are barely talking about their ‘small government’ acting like this
Fickle-Resolution133,Do it. He hasn't won a lawsuit yet for any if his BS.
zeusthunder,What’s the conservative logic on banning African American studies? Isn’t it just a history class focusing on  the African American community?
Icy-Morning-4896,Does he still have that registered foreign agent on his payroll?
fake_fakington,"How blatantly racist of him to try and ban it anyways. How does anyone who is not a horrible, ignorant human being support this guy at all?"

veritas-joon,"You know, between banning African American studies, and having teenage girls athletes having to show their menstrual period schedule.... Florida looks like a fucked up place to live"
Livid-Pen-8372,This is going to lead to more people doing their own self-learning and uncovering a more disturbing truth than what is taught in public schools. Backfire!
big_juice01,As they should.
atomsnine,">Threaten to sue

Don’t threaten, just sue the fascist."
Ilikepancakes87,GOP: “See? Our policies are giving students real world experience with the justice system. AP African American Studies can’t do that.”
frivolouspringlesix9,Well the adults in that state arent doing shit
crypticedge,"They should sue him over the fact he would invade high school parties and force himself on students when he was a teacher at a private school that fired him for being a pedophile.

Or sue him over him being a war criminal who oversaw the sexual torture in violation of the geneva convention of children.

Really he has a lot of things he can be sued over, all of them over the fact he crawled out of the pits of hell and only people who worship the antichrist support him"
sarovan,This was always going to get sued into oblivion. Just being a jackhole for headlines.
SnooDucks6514,"&#x200B;

DeSantis is a bigot and a rotten example of decency."
TypeNirvash,DeSantis looks like his name should be Barney
horrorsd,Desantis know more about make-up then African American studies.  Dudes got enough foundation on to cover up the entire civil rights movement.
Tb1969,"It’s OK, Florida taxpayers will pay for this thug’s legal defense."
Appropriate-Law5963,Please do!!
,"DeSantis: “If they don’t like my decision, they can go back to Africa. It’s not like we forced them to be here, anyway.”"
Swain0,I thought America was all about free speech?🤷🏻‍♂️
Budget_Walk_6988,African Americans have been treated terribly the past 10 years. Now they want the whole world to know and these Republicans don't want the truth coming out against them. They're afraid of more riots and demonstrations because more people now acknowledge and pulled away from their awful parents that likely taught them these racist rhetorics to begin with. So less woke people means more easily controllable conservatives. Pin them against the wall I say and make them see what they've created... They're upset because what could've been edited by a newspaper can now instantly be documented and exposed with a cellphone. Do you mean to tell me the Conservatives hate being exposed for being racist? Then maybe they should quit being racist. Idk I'm just a dumb lefty sheep 🤡
Usagi_Motosuwa,"Fuck this corny mother fucker and his ugly white boots. Just another a needle-dick, right-wing, piece of shit."
lesvegetables,Do it.
Correct_Campaign5432,"I hope they sue Ron DeSantis for his hateful bullshit rhetoric. In fact, I hope they saw him into oblivion and make him homeless. Then we can bus him to Texas, so it’s Greg Abbott’s problem who will then bus him to a democratic state, where he can be treated like the child he is, and put under the care of competent adults, such as exists within government."
thejustducky1,"And into the headlines he goes again 🙄  

He's doing the same culture war bullshit his big orange clone did and if we're not careful it's going to put him right in office.  Bad press is good press."
The_Pandalorian,Pro tip: Don't threaten to sue. Serve that motherfucker some papers.

Gary_Vigoda,"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/31/us/african-american-favored-by-many-of-america-s-blacks.html

Americans didn't adopt the African-American label until 1989 roughly and it's a label Jesse Jackson used while pandering to supporters of Louis Farrakhan who are black nationalists on the SPLC hate watch list.

MLK was trying to integrate and just be treated as a regular American and for you guys to get rid of the slums.

> ""The slums are the handiwork of a vicious system of the white society. Negros live in them but do not make them any more than a prisoner makes a prison"".

https://youtu.be/8B4aJcP-ZCY

Malcolm X knew the US wouldn't integrate because your political establishment benefits from keeping 'them' on the outside which is why the establishment imposed the segregated African-American label roughly 25 years after the Civil rights movement.

https://youtu.be/T3PaqxblOx0

60 years after the Civil Rights movement, Americans are just as segregated and pushing racist policies in your schools that justify keeping black Americans in the slums and treated as a perpetual victim class."
AceCombat9519,due to anti wake act
TheAnswerWithinUs,And I always thought the GOP were the ones screeching about freedom and deepthroating the constitution. Seems to be pretty anti-1A to me
Neidan1,Sue him!
ekaceerf,Win or lose and it doesn't matter because the tax payer will foot the bill
selfimmolations,how many lawsuits can one moron have
SafeToPost,The dudes 44 years old with 3 kids… when will he just stop caring that some guys have bigger dicks than him?
AdGreat8798,"So I saw the title and my first thought was, ""Are either of those 2 things possible?"" Can a governor block a course and can he be sued for it? So I went looking for answers. I didn't find a definitive on blocking courses but it appears he can be sued. I didn't find much factual information, mostly opinion articles. Which then lead me to the question of what was in the African American studies? Surprisingly, the articles really don't explain the studies, just bash him for not agreeing to it. So, once again, I was off to discover what the opinion articles left out. Not going to lie, I felt they were being one sided and pushing the agenda of not liking him. But that is neither here or there in my search for answers. The articles did say it was pilot program and available in other states, so I looked it up directly. While I don't know EXACTLY what was being taught, the description sounds just like our Chicano Studies here in Texas. Just substitute African American for Chicano. It also reminded me of Deaf culture classes. Being Hispanic myself, I've never personally taken the Chicano studies but I have looked into Deaf culture because there is more to ASL than just hand movements. At the end of the day, if it's factual information (not leaning towards any one side) but just undeniable facts like Deaf Culture, then why not teach it?"
Farty_Nonsense,"DeSantis, racist and stupid. If Florida were a man."
SPY_Expert,"DeSantis, granted perhaps inadvertently, is actually helping Black Community here. We're actually tired of everybody using our sufferage to push their agenda while leaving us to rot in the aftermath."
xmercenaryx,A course in finance would be much better. Each generation becomes more and more useless.
wingedwild,"If african studies courses are allowed then let school teach other race classes ,it's only fair ....unless your pushing an agenda and only want to learn about one race"

Local-Talk-3831,“Lock him up !!!”
WittyViking,Is rebranding CRT to African American studies really the right thing to do? It seems disingenuous to lump it in with general history when it's more of a sociological and philosophical framework.
limb3h,Just change the course to AP ebonics.  If they ban it they have to ban all the other AP language courses
