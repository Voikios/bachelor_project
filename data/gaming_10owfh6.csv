navor,Its probably a business at this point? Selling high lvl accounts? Trading rares?
NillaBeanBuns,Has he... Caught them all yet?
ItsACaragor,How does he even reach the last three rows with any precision?
JanJaapen,"Six was unsafe in traffic, sixty is just stupid"
Gaudor,"He is a old man from Taiwan who is very famous.

Recently he had some bad health issue(stroke) so he had been stopped by his family.

He had some bad habit just like all the gamer do. He plays until midnight and dont even stop. In nights when he can't sleep he will sneak out and catch Pokemon which is the reason why his family is so strongly against him playing pokemon GO.

He has already stopped playing so this is definitely not a NOW.

Edit: some typo"
AFishNamedFreddie,"Whenever that dude parks to catch a mon, google maps is gonna think theres a massive traffic jam"
MixPlan,"Grandpa be like: ""This is not even my final form!"""
kailedude,Just needs a way to recycle the energy from the wheels motion and convert it into power to charge all the devices at the same time
Kindly_Leg_7976,"This is crazy dangerous, tho.."
agouraki,i wonder if one of the middle phones are on camera mode so he can see the road.
jak2125,‚ÄúNow‚Äù. This pic is at least 3 years old.
JakesBigPhone,Is ‚Äúnow‚Äù in 2020 (4years after the release of pogo)?
ShadowEllipse,Reported for boosting.
Almacca,Being able to see where you're going is so overrated.
Major_Fambrough,"Some redditors pointed out he had stopped playing because of stroke, but it seems like he had partly recovered from it and is back on playing pokemon.

Though the number of the phones he uses has reduced from 72 to 15.

Stealthfox94,How does he see??
Wundawuzi,"Assuming this is legit... For this game you have to have location tracking active, right?

Now... Doesnt this mean that wherever ge goes with all these phones google maps should register that as traffic jam?"
RealitySmasher47,He probably messes with Google thinking there's alot of traffic in the one spot or when he walks into a place
FirebatDZ,"Imagine going down Cycling road at max speed. Zooming your way to Fuchsia city to beat Koga or spend some time on the Safari Zone and your bike gets stopped completely by a check mark from the bushes. You look to your left and this guy comes rolling in. His sprite MASSIVE from all the phones. 

Battle music starts and you see this enigma of a man standing there ready to deliver your demise. You are not prepared!"
Cakey-Head,"I don't know if she still plays, but my mother, in her mid-50's, used to be, like the Pokemon Go master of her area.  I went for a casual walk with her to the park one day, and there were these teenagers at a Poke-stop.  They all recognized her, and they were all waiting for her to arrive to help with a gym raid or whatever it is.  I don't play Pokemon Go; so I don't understand the details, but it was the funniest thing to see these kids treating get like some sort of Pokemon master."
madmonkey918,I've seen a professional made sign on a cemetery fence asking not to hunt Pok√©mon in the cemetery. I was shocked it happens enough that they had a sign made.
zultan3,"I'm not even sure if you can actually drive like that. You can't see where you are going.

you can't even reach the upper smartphones.  maybe it's a fake"
Freeman10,Either he's insane or it's his job.
Good_Nyborg,"Remember when Batman used all the smart phones to scan the city?

Biscuits4u2,Imagine having to charge that many devices
Donvack,This is the final boss when you beat the elite 4!
MrFormarotica,"That's pretty depressing to see, honestly. As addicting as *Pok√©mon GO* is, I can't imagine being this obsessed with it."
Powerful-Brother-791,That's one way to increase the risks of falling.
jsamuraij,It would be infuriating to deal with this guy wandering all over your block.
skirtpost,This is what addiction looks like
GP2090,"""try to block my number bitch I dare you"""
Thin_Map6842,"Ok but, are there thieves? This looks like the easiest target for a thief."
gtbka,This old man play Pokemon hardcore to prevent getting Alzheimer's.
Alpha1998,This is how Google maps traffic gets fucked up lol.
White_Wolfie95,"He must make enough money that getting robbed wont effect him because no matter what country you're in, you're asking for a robbery when you're riding like that."
Kear_Bear_3747,If you find a pond in Vancouver pretty much guaranteed you‚Äôll find a bench with an old person casually slinging poke balls
tnjos25,"I remember reading about someone who made a street appear congested on Google or Apple Maps b/c they brought a whole bunch of phones with them in a hand-pulled wagon, and it made the map application think there were so many cars moving really slowly.  This reminded me of that"
Madouc,If he activates google maps he'll simulate a traffic jam
Goldenslicer,But... why? Pokemon GO isn't even a good game.
Bildad__,This is the future of mental illness
CmdrSelfEvident,I need to list to Quadrophenia again.
susankeane,He... evolved
JDWTFO199,How is this even possible
jamexxx,It‚Äôs all funny until this clown comes to your neighborhood. Every gym around me is constantly controlled by one guy with endless alt accounts.
themark504,How has he not been robbed?
Recyclingkingdom,This is ridiculous.
ShowtimerHD,This game wasn‚Äôt what I wanted it to be sadly but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs still popular asf holy shit the determination of some ppl

Mr_Zetta,{CYBERPUNK 2077}
Jazs1994,He's retired from playing so many now. I think he had kicked 6/7 phones and then got sponsored by some company. The guy would play by hand too üòÖ

lopedopenope,This dude still going!?
ryanleebmw,**does all of this and still hasn‚Äôt caught shiny Ditto**
levinyl,How does that even work? Surely Nintendo dont allow more than 1 sign in per account!
MatsThyWit,"K...that's funny...but just traveling down the street like that alone could get someone killed. It's literally impossible for him to see where he's going, or what's coming toward him."
Michelrpg,I cant quite explain this but my gut tells me this might be a traffic hazard
ricebowl_samurai,I wanna be the very best
skrshawk,"Ever know a senior citizen that plays bingo like a fiend?  20 or more cards at once, dabbing with both hands with the speed and precision of a competitive FPS gamer?

Same thing, just out in public and with modern technology."
ZenCannon,"He is an extreme example, but just in general, when I traveled around East Asia before the pandemic, Taiwan was a huge hot spot for Pokemon Go. Lots of stops, and the gyms were hotly contested not just in Taipei, but in some of the smaller cities that I went to. Very easy to get raid groups too."
RC_Perspective,No wonder I can't find any shinies in this event üòÇ
Monoethylamine,Is he out of Osaka? Think I've seen him.
-Redstoneboi-,this is a real bruh moment

Dounut-brain,"Bro really said, ‚Äúgotta catch em all‚Äù"
freethebeesknees,There has to be something easier. Like a roller wheel setup or something less distracting.
bubbling-fish,"He is not collecting Pok√©mon‚Äôs already, he is collecting phones."
Doctor_Will,Someone needs to stop this lol this is unhealthy on a new level
Exterergh,Selling high lvl accounts?
sonicrings4,This isn't 4 years later. That pic was taken near the game's launch.
dutch665,This is at least 2 years old?
FaithfulFear,That pic on the right is like 4 years old lol. Waaay behind
PandaEven3982,I'm just hoping he has a few of them looking forward through the camera for real. No Pokemon :-)

erikeltipo,"The ""now"" is a picture is from years ago, too."
RatedPsychoPat,Can catch em all
Ok-Relationship-9767,He is dedicated üòÇ
ConfusedConnect,Why tho? Like why? What purpose is there for this?
Drink15,I miss the hype Pok√©mon Go had when it came out. You would see packs of grown men in the afternoon during a weekend day roaming around the city catching Pok√©mon.
Chewgnome,"The NOW is a 4 years old photo, maybe older"
mcnugget04830,"How y‚Äôall think he goes about charging all of them, do y‚Äôall think he just has like 35 chargers all hooked up to the same outlet"

DoucheCanoe456,What a GUY
yoseflotz,How does he not die riding that
dr_van_nostren,If only you needed to be able to SEE to navigate a bike.
ImALeaf_OnTheWind,"There's people using AR glasses like Nreal Air as a HUD when they drive/bike/walk around. I totally believe this will be possible in the near future with virtual screens in AR (so you're not obscuring your FOV completely). I don't condone it, though - as I expect major liability if you cause an accident doing that."
arezlee,I saw this guy when my wife and I were ion vacation ! He‚Äôs a legend
infinit9,Huh? Some of those phones are off??
samyruno,Lmao this probably causes traffic on Google maps
Alexis-Bell,"I'm not surprised if someone jumps out to steal some phones, especially here in America."
Frequent_Yoghurt_425,Legend
Intrepid_Look_5725,That's dumb ass he'll and looks dangerous.
RedPillOnlyEFT,Where in the heck did he manage to build or find a contraption to hold them any phones in the first place. That's the most impressive thing here in this picture.
MattyIcex4,"Am I the only one who thinks it's infuriating that he has a setup that completely blocks his vision while he's riding, or am I missing something?"
Suspicious_Quiet6643,How does he see where he's going? I hope he doesn't crash.
Bene2403,"Brandon Tan did a video on this old man a long time ago so nothing new and he doesnt sell any of the accounts or pokemon, he legitimately does this for fun and yes he does get sponsored with the free phones and he carrys around a huge battery too. He let's all the kids come and play, throwing pokeballs although they miss most of the time"
AVWF,Is this what the Uber drivers who use like 5 phones are doing??

SuperSolicitation528,"While several Redditors noted that he had stopped playing due to a stroke, it appears that he has mostly recovered and has resumed playing Pokemon."
inexperiencedallo258,I guess he was unaware that you could fake your GPS position. He would have avoided a great deal of problems.
antique_dumps340,"When my wife and I were on vacation, I noticed this guy! He is legendary."
caringscissors3350,Anyone else read this as a grandfather who is a diehard thug hunter?
toothsomesomewher135,"When they drive, ride a bike, or go for a stroll, some users use AR glasses like Nreal Air as a HUD. I have no doubt that virtual displays for augmented reality will make this possible in the near future (so you won't entirely block your field of view). However, because I anticipate significant culpability if you cause an accident doing that, I don't support it."
