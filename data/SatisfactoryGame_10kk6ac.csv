no-one-416c,"Have you thought about using the ficsit networks mod? It has a bunch of buildings like screens, control panels, speaker poles, etc. You can program computers to interact with the normal buildings and display information and further automate everything. There's even ways that you can add interactions between the in game computer and discord (just a matter of programming)"

AlexStarkiller20,Mod?
R0ckandr0ll_318,Where is the AZ5 button?
Falcon187,I see you have a weather screen. I really wish they would add weather effects to this game rather than just perfect weather all the time
Significant_Ad_4995,"That's pretty sweet. If you want to add another sign, you could add one called ""Air Quality"" since that's something that is strictly controlled in most areas where manufacturing takes place...however, something tells me that FICSIT could care less lol"
MakerGaming2022,This is amazing
