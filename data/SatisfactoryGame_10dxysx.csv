UristImiknorris,"You're making this a warehouse, right?"
bodhisalmon,Ah wow you fooled me. That first picture is convincing. Well done!
wolfcry23,That's so bad ass. How did you do that?
carppediem,"Okay seriously thought this was just a plain old storage container and thought what‚Äôs the big deal.  Then‚Ä¶holy shit 
Bravo I‚Äôm supper impressed"
pat__pix,How long did it take you to get the scale correctly? Great work. üëç
DiamondExcavater,I expected you to show off a no clip through a regular container. Wow idk where to begin
Sheersanctity,You need a container inside a container to contain that container full of containers
DanzaDragon,"Manufacturer next right? ;)

Actually thought you used micromanage at first to scale it up. Great job!"
The-Wylds,"That's silly, this is silly.

&#x200B;

I love it."
Killapoo69,You should put one personal storage box in the middle and thats all
imakin,is this vanilla? this would make a good prank to show this in multiplayer
Zenvarix,"Are you the one who posted the Mark 1 Conveyor road/tunnel blueprint or were you just inspired by it (or its creator)? I didn't catch on that you weren't  just glitching through a container until I saw the conveyor, considering I saw the blueprint a few hours ago..."
No_Access_8946,Nice build
CdrRed_beard,You got me. That's really awesome work. The scale is perfect
Briinzo,I love it
mangdags,I can't contain my amusement
KickBassColonyDrop,"Now scale this out so that it's size of the entire map. Then like Matroska Dolls, make a container inside a container inside a container inside a container until you get to the smallest unit of container.

At the outer edge, put in materials to build the next tier of technology or part. Each layer in are the next set of materials. At the very core of the containers, exists star stuff or whatever the end game material is.


Then fly out of to the edge of the map to the largest container. Stand a 100 meters from it. Save. Quit.

Release the map to this community:

Goal: get Star Stuff.

You'll be become legend."
NotSelfAware,Genuinely thought this was that bug where you see gigantic items like the chainsaw being as big as mountains. My mouth literally dropped open when I saw the second picture and realised you'd built this yourself. Major kudos.
Gonemad79,Tell me you got a train entering the belt hole...
Character_Contest394,"That's awesome, dude! For a second I really thought it is just a normal Container"

Diacred,This is insane! Would you mind sharing your savefile? I'd love to be able to see it in game this is so rad
KonChaiMudPi,Incredible. I genuinely didn‚Äôt realize this was a build until looking closer. How long did this take?
DesingerOfWorlds,Hhh‚Ä¶.how though? I literally cant even tell what some of the detailing is made from. Very impressive.
ClassroomMost9519,"Holy smokes, I admire the sheer commitment to the joke, bravo."
kevinz99,is this a mod?
python_artist,Wow
MasterG76,Your doing the great finacial gods work! With a container like that we should be able to boost productivity by 100 times!
Nehelic,Amazing build. I want one (or ten)!
laxkid7,Lmao i should add some minions running around in there. Would be priceless
CuriouslySane,We don't talk about what happens inside the containers.  They're black voids for a reason.
PxlHD,I once died from standing inside a train container and got yeeted away xD
rudger82,i've might have seen the blueprint at satisfactory-calculator.com earlier ?

ICANTTHINK0FNAMES,"That‚Äôs so well made, damn."
samsa-_-blam,I wonder how many containers can fit in one container
Freakscar,"""Huh. What's so special about noclipping through ingame geome‚Ä¶""<pic 11>""‚Ä¶oh. Oh my!""
