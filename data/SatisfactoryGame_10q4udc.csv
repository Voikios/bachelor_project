SpectreGBR,There is no way we are playing the same game
JimmyTDM,"No matter what you say, I refuse to believe that that is a build made by a living being, let alone sane."
creusat0r,Why does this look weirdly realistic? ü§î
Seeker15438,"When they say that factory verticality is encouraged (in beginning when unlocking conveyor lift), I think you took them very very literally lol"
Bosht,How the hell. Someday I'll be cool. Someday.
Ernie_Devlin_9799,Holy crap! Please post more screenshots of your work

I have 1,2,4 metre foundations and two heights of walls."
TheOGPotatoChild,This hurts just to look at. I am currently attempting to remake this
parkerhamster28,This looks like something out of Star Citizen. Absolutely unreal! Fantastic work
Ralph_hh,"Wow. I'd love to see some more picture from this, e.g. from a distance. Looks amazing. Is all your stuff built like this?"
The_White_Prism,Woww... so much work must have been put into this! How long did this take you?
foxanon,What in half life am I looking at
KickBassColonyDrop,There's nothing basic about this you overachiever!
Date0516,"I wish there was a way to copy your blueprint print to paste more of the same around your map. 

I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm trying to get it, but I have a hard time with big builds because I can‚Äôt copy and paste the thing I made to make more of what I have. If OP could build a number of these, I would love to see it. Honestly it‚Äôs incredible as is. ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù my ass"

starch77,op are you god
vincent2057,A little overkill for 6 machine prehaps but it looks fucking awesome.

s1mmel,"I'm...what? This is .... I'm missing words right now. Just, wow!"
centermerge,"Been putting off getting back into this game because builds like this help me realize that all other ""real"" life needs I have will be ignored terribly. That said, when I do jump back in I shall attempt something inspired by this perfection. Well done!"

totallytotal2020,"So I have dropped the game these past 6 months. Burned out with 487 hrs and today starting fresh, meaning from ""landing"".... And I see this.... and I know I did not save my previous game. Life can be so challenging sometimes"
Tacobell1236231,I don't even put up walls and you got that thing down?

I appreciate that you've done what's possible rather than trying to recreate what we think a factory is in our real world.

Very clever work."
