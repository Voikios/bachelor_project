QueBienTevez,I should check my closet for classified documents
recovering_spaz,">It is not yet clear what the documents are related to or their level of sensitivity or classification. Pence‚Äôs team plans to notify Congress on Tuesday.

>Pence asked his lawyer to conduct the search of his home out of an abundance of caution, and the attorney began going through four boxes stored at Pence‚Äôs house last week, finding a small number of documents with classified markings, the sources said.

It seems like he's trying to do the right thing. Whether that's because it was a legitimate mistake or he was caught and is trying to soften the penalty remains to be seen."
politicsfuckingsucks,This is getting so ridiculous. Check every past president and VP's house apparently.
jdmorgenstern,I'd give anything to be a fly on Pence's head right now.
VaguelyArtistic,"AUGUST 20, 2022:

>[Pence says he didn‚Äôt leave office with any classified material](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/politics/pence-says-he-didnt-leave-office-with-any-classified-material)"
AcademicPublius,"This is a pretty good example of why the case against Trump was always more complicated than ""he has the documents, go get him"".

It's also the resistance to turning them back in, the declaration that he didn't have more, and where they ended up getting stored (and the lack of security there)."
logicalnoise,"NPR had a good report on how most classified documents don't need that label, but there's far more trouble when a document isn't classified than when it is and shouldn't be. So the people who handle these often will make them classified just to CYA. That said Trump had nuclear secrets in his house and pulled a LOT of BS. Everyone else has cooperated appropiately."
J4k0b42,Has anyone checked in on Jimmy Carter? There are a lot of possible houses he could have left documents in.
NBCspec,"At this point, I'm wondering who doesn't have some."
M00n,I don't like that this is whitewashing Trumps illegal holding and hiding of documents and refusing to return them... and missing documents in folders and some of his documents held sensitive compartmented information which could cause grave damage to national security. And nuclear secrets...
LucyRiversinker,"Now let‚Äôs check Kushner and Bannon, please."
Konukaame,">A lawyer for former Vice President Mike Pence discovered about a dozen documents marked as classified at Pence‚Äôs Indiana home last week, and he has turned those classified records over to the FBI, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN.

And just like Biden's team, and completely UNLIKE Trump's, he did the right thing and handed them over immediately, which makes this one also a non-story, as far as I'm concerned. At most, Pence some criticism for hypocrisy since he's been shitting on Biden, but that's it.

It falls under the ""don't punish the behavior you want"" principle. If the proper return of accidentally removed documents is punished, it incentivizes people to hide or destroy such documents in the future instead of returning them."
troubadoursmith,"Okay.

So like... obviously these are both very different from Trump repeatedly lying about having things, refusing to return them, and making clear efforts to hide them. 

But also we REALLY obviously need to entirely rethink our systems for handling, handing out, tracking, and getting back classified material. I've seen more careful control procedures over arduino kits at a community college."
Rayearl,I‚Äôm just going to follow the Fox News narrative for Biden and call this treason.
User767676,So is pence handling it the Biden way or the Trump way?
joegreen592,"See that wasn‚Äôt so fucken hard to do (Biden/Pence),

1) find classified docs in your possession/home
2) report said documents to appropriate agency(s)
3) return said documents promptly

What‚Äôs Trumps fucken excuse now for not returning the classified docs in his possession/home except being a POS?"
Stag328,"I am guessing they could find documents at almost every single person in the governments house that would be classified in some way.


I think finding them and removing them is the right thing to do jo matter who has them but I think maybe we should somehow distinguish ‚Äúhow classified‚Äù these documents are.


There is a huge difference between a company that has a government contract and nuclear codes or a list of CIA agents names. 


Also volumtarily turning them in versus fighting their removal is a big difference.


Edit: When I said government I more meant along the lines of politicians and elected offices."
WorkAccount42318,"Lets be clear, Biden and Pence said it was inadvertent and it was a handful of documents. Trump had much more and he intentionally kept the records found as a sort of trophy."
HeartFullONeutrality,I'm starting to suspect the government is not very good at keeping track of classified documents.
SpaceButler,"It's clear that the system we have now to track classified documents given to officials in very highest levels of government isn't functioning correctly. 

Trump was an outlier in that he was actively obstructing return of these types of documents, but it seems like they're all over the place."
BabyYodaX,I have no classified documents. Just saying.
AnalSoapOpera,After he criticized Biden for having classified documents.
jakegh,"Two main takeaways from this ongoing story.

1) It's actually quite common for heads of state to mishandle classified documents, and we need to fix that.

2) Biden and Pence immediately returned the documents and notified the authorities, but Trump tried to keep them and lied to law enforcement."
hellomondays,The difference between Pence and Trump is that Pence's lawyers seem to have followed the proper procedures instead of obstructing
circa285,Better also check Jared and Ivanka's homes as well.
Kate2point718,I'm starting to wonder if I need to go check my garage for classified documents.
clucker7,"I'm sure Pence's was inadvertent, as was Biden's. But Trump tried to deceive in order to keep the documents. That's a different story. What are the odds right wing media agrees that Biden and Pence are equivalent while Trump is not? 0%?"
Fomentor,I‚Äôm guessing that classified documents would be found in most ex president and ex vice president homes. I think it‚Äôs part of the lax system that is in place for tracking of the documents. There is a distinction between unintentionally hanging onto documents and the intentional hanging on to documents that tRump did.
syo,"I'm shocked, shocked I tell you."
merigouldi,Is this going to end up being the type of thing where this is extremely common and didn't become an issue until Trump just completely took it to a new level?
hatesnack,"I think the difference between Biden/pence having documents, and trump having them, is that Trump purposefully took documents, was asked to return them, and refused. There was pretty clear intent.

Biden, or someone else, found documents in his garage, and called the correct people to collect them. This shouldn't be that big of a deal."
ultralightdude,My hope it that the Biden/Pence docs don't normalize what Trump did.  Don't let the GOP change the rhetoric on this.
jfenton9817,Pence and Biden‚Äôs classified docs still don‚Äôt come close to the multiple cases of Top Secret docs at Mar a lago and refusal to turn over after discovering them missing.
TheTeenageOldman,"Oooh, Mother is not going to be happy."
BringBackAoE,Starting to realize just how outrageous the Benghazi / ‚Äúbut her emails‚Äù attack on Hillary Clinton was.
azure_monster,"Jesus Christ, I'm glad Pence is following biden's footsteps and complying with authorities, shame on Trump."
Patzdat,"Everyone had to remember,  deliberately taking multiple  boxes of classified documents and refusing to return them is  a heap different to these guys accidentally leaving a handful,  and instantly returning once found"
Louiethefly,"I hope the FBI is checking Kushner, Bannon and Flynn."
ShodoDeka,"Not that I like Pence, but just realize that unlike Trump, he hired a Lawyer to go through his home to check if something was left there and then alert the National Archives if there was. Instead of you know, refuse to handover anything."
Showmethepathplease,"The funny thing about trump is that he could have escaped any issues if he had just returned the docs

Always picks the worst path"
TempleOfDoomfist,"Conservatives wanting to launch a million investigations into Biden are suddenly silent again.

Strange why that is ü§î"
weed_blazepot,"Hey dawg... people take work home and sometimes forget about it. We get it. I bet Bush and Clinton are like, ""Oh shit, were we supposed to turn that in?"" right about now too. 

The issue isn't ""did you take work documents home and forget?"" The question is ""Did you then lie about it and swear and have attorneys swear you didn't have them, then turn in some of the documents you swore you didn't have, and not others, until the FBI had to raid your house to get them?"""
ljuvlig,Clearly all these notherfuckers abuse the classified system. But only Trump made it an Olympic event and then obstructed Justice.
tomparker,Mother found them along with a stack of Hustler and two packs of Tareytons.
jda823,This makes it seem like there is more of an issue with document tracking than anything.
heavy_cupping,Guy will do anything to try to seem Presidential.
dtxucker,Obama or Bush next?
DashCat9,"Okay, now after flipping back to CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS IN PLACES BAD, it's gonna be really funny watching the Right Wing media pretend this is fine."
dinoroo,Damn I think I might need to start checking my house.
rockstarsball,"I cant wait to see the headline ""Classified Documents being used as insulation in all the homes Jimmy Carter built for habitat for humanity"""
thedirtyharryg,"National Archives out here like Oprah apparently.

""You get documents! You get documents! EVERYBODY gets documents!"""
Perniciosius,Time to search everyone‚Äôs house! Paul Ryan. Pompeo. Jim Jordan. Paul Gossar. Pelosi. McCarthy. Mcconnell....etc
hamburgers666,"Fuck Mike Pence, but he did the right thing in simply turning them over. Just like with Biden, once they are discovered they both did the responsible thing. It is entirely possible that these documents were not classified when they were removed but have since been classified.

I am starting to think that pretty much every elected official, no matter the party, has some classified material at their home. The issues only start popping up if you do what 45 did."
MarveltheMusical,"So, not to excuse anybody‚Äôs handling of this, and they all should be going through due process, but at some point, we should probably start asking about how well secured these documents are."
daikatana,"So it's a systemic problem. Except Trump, who intentionally took them and refused to give them back."
TheExtremistModerate,"And, just like with Biden, these documents were found by Pence's own lawyers and immediately returned to the proper authorities.

These two situations are not at all comparable to Trump's situation."
Fearless_Farter,Still not comparable to Trump stealing documents.
Articulated,"Look, can everyone just check and make sure they don't have any classified docs at their house?"
MawsonAntarctica,All this is showing me (without judgment on whom) it seems relatively easy to misplace sensitive documents and that should be the story because like others have said probably all politicians have some.
amcfarla,Does it really matter if they are willing to give them back and be open to any searches?  None of this is comparable to Trump's situation due to the fact he wouldn't give them back and required the FBI to raid his residence to get them back.
radhaz,"I was enlisted with clearance that required me to be ""read in"" along my career. I handled classified documents on pretty much a daily basis for I don't know at least 17 years. 

We didn't even have provisions for removing material from the site so it's hard for me to wrap my head around how politicians are expected to handle classified material let alone have it loose in their homes/offices. 

For the uninitiated there's tiers to classifications Confidential, Secret, Top Secret, Top Secret Secret Compartmentalized Information (SCI) are the standard ones I encountered then theres just general information thats considered ""sensitive"" and other modifiers like NOFORN meaning even if its an ally member that has the clearance still can't view it.

When the Maralago pic came out and I saw the SCI cover sheets it was shocking to say the least. Maybe there wasn't a document that went with that cover sheet but the fact that the cover sheet existed likely means something went with it and was/is loose in the wild.

Deadly force is only authorized by security personnel for threats to personnel and threats to national security. We use the ""Deadly Force Triangle"" to spell out threats pretty clearly to personnel but the national security stipulation was always a bit of a quagmire with the exception being SCI material as that material supercedes Top Secret and means you can only access that information on a need to know basis and those that needed to know were ""read in"" to the specific programs. Its just good ""housekeeping"" to prevent information being improperly disseminated.

These news reports all keep generalizing ""classified"" information documents as one big entity but they're not all the same. A confidential document being left out that discusses the operating frequency of a radar used by twenty countries and can be found on Wikipedia is not the same as an SCI document that discusses specific operations of super secret squirrel program that does not exist.

Any improper dissemination of classified documents compromises security as a whole and I can not understand how these Boomers do not have security managers let alone ""handlers"" to keep these chuckle fucks from screwing up like this.

This concludes my old man yelling into the wind ted talk thank you."
pakepake,Time for the FBI to raid Mt. Vernon!
GettingOverTheHump,"Meanwhile, Jimmy Carter is on his farm like, ‚ÄúAm I the only one who turned in my classified documents?‚Äù"
batmans_prostate,They should do a broad sweep of all govt employees and elected officials at this point. Prosecute all of them!
ktnorberg,I should check my house at this point.
PM-Me-Your-BeesKnees,"I'm starting to think we don't do a very good job securing our classified documents...

But honestly, I'm struggling to understand why you'd want to take any documents with you other than maybe correspondence.  Treat it like the last day of school and just walk the fuck out."
Disastrous-Ad2800,"I don't think people care about the classified documents itself, I mean I doubt there are secret alien autopsy pics at Roswell amongst them, it's just that Trump Nation's reaction was so fucking hilarious... remember the cavalcade they organised outside Mar-a-lago to intimidate law enforcement? drenched Trump supporters in raincoats, with MAGA caps and rifles... geez!"
asdfgtttt,The sheer fact that the personal lawyers were the ones to hand over the file in both instances.. v 45 where special agents with appropriate clearance were needed to execute the warrant and fisa judges needing additional clearance tells us all we need to know about the difference in context.
huggles7,"There‚Äôs probably something at every former president or vice presidents home

The problem with trump isn‚Äôt that he had them the problem is that he lied about them and refused to give them back"
bjjdoug,This stinks of Trump's allies just muddying the shit out of the waters for him. Dude still did way fucking worse than just have a few documents turn up.
cdsmith,"Looks like the same situation as with Biden; he inadvertently ended up with classified documents, his own attorney found them, and they voluntarily informed the right authorities.  I'm sure there will be an investigation just in case, but at first glance, it doesn't look like there's a story here."
TheHuffKy,"Did he return them immediately or did he lie and lie and refuse, force law enforcement to obtain a warrant, hide them in his desk, then file false paperwork, then claim they were declassified, then start moving them around his property, on and on?
As if ‚Äúpacking in a hurry‚Äù was a sensible argument."
Black_Magic_M-66,Wish Justice would search Trump's other properties.  It's stupid to think that a guy who won't turn over classified documents only kept them in one location.
prof_the_doom,I think I just injured myself from laughing so far.
circa285,"But ""her emails""."
md4024,"lmaoooo Mike Pence is so desperate for attention he threw himself into the ongoing classified document scandals. 

I think at some point we are going to have to accept that the real problem here is that the government has a problem with over classification, which inevitably leads to people becoming careless with classified documents that really have no business being marked classified. I'm willing to bet if we did a deep dive into the servers and homes of every high level politician from both parties, we would find some classified materials where they technically don't belong."
illiniguy20,"
And when found, immediately turned over, and no one is calling for him to be prosecuted.  Biden did the right and legal thing, Pence did the right and legal thing, Trump committed crimes with his documents."
Ken808,"What‚Äôs the difference between classified info found at Trump, Biden, and now Pences residences? Mens Rea. Criminal intent matters. https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mens_rea"
BastardInTheNorth,"In unrelated news, George W. Bush has been seen burning a lot more ‚Äúbrush piles‚Äù than usual at his Texas ranch these last few weeks.

The FBI tried searching Bill Clinton‚Äôs papers, but they were all stuck together for some reason.

Jimmy Carter has sheepishly turned over the user manual for a 1977 Magnavox television while profusely apologizing. 

And Dick Cheney has invited the entire DOJ out on a hunting expedition."
linguotgr,"I have said this before and I am sure it will be relevant again... all of this speaks to a very serious issue where those in power dont take information security seriously.  That was what should have been focused on with the Hillary email server scandal, its what should be the issue with Biden, and it is probably the issue here.  Trump was another thing, that was probably malice.  But it is apparent that on some level once someone gets into high office, no one actually forces them to follow basic security protocols.  Eventually this will bite us in the ass, if it already hasn't."
LiterallyCantEvenUgh,"I hate Trump as much as the next person but if he would have just cooperated like a normal government official would, which he is incapable of, he wouldnt have looked so bad (with this at least ü§£). 
I guess we are starting to see that this is a common issue and I am wondering if its the handling of documents when the move occurs. Staffers and such placing papers in boxes and moving out."
8to24,"As documents continue to be found in the possession of former and current officials it is important to remember what differentiates Trump's situation. Trump refused to cooperate with the return of documents. Trump lied to officials and defined a subpoena for the return of specific documents. 

Pence or Biden willfully returning documents and cooperating fully isn't that same."
jmcdon00,This seems like great news for Biden.
artificialavocado,This isn‚Äôt 50/50. We don‚Äôt even know what Biden or Pence even had right now. The contents matter. Trump had documents about nuclear weapons in his basement. He was shown thousands of documents over his four years it isn‚Äôt coincidence that the stuff he stole was about nuclear bombs.
31nigrhcdrh,They are planting them to take the heat off of rump
Kilo_Xray,We clearly have a systemic problem with mishandling classified documents. I sure hope policy changes are being made to curb further mishandling at the root.
tf199280,Classified docs will be found at all presidents homes
GardenCaviar,"**Joe Biden:** Discovered classified documents at his residence, contacted  the DOJ and Archives and arranged to turn over the documents immediately.

**Mike Pence:** Discovered classified documents at his residence, contacted  the DOJ and Archives and arranged to turn over the documents immediately.

**Donald Trump:** Lied about possessing hundreds of classified documents, failed to properly secure stored classified documents, negligently risked foreign agents accessing the improperly secured documents, insisted that he had psychically declassified the documents, claimed that he personally owned the classified documents, refused DOJ demands to return the classified documents to the Archive... All of this amid allegations of attempting to flush white house documents down the toilet, tear them into pieces, throw them in the trash, etc..."
Earptastic,"Maybe we need a better system for classified documents.

If I checked a book out of the local library they knew I had it. This was in 1980 and it was a crappy book. I think we can do better with classified documents."
fishdybuns,"Damn, I better check my garage. This shit is everywhere."
tsweeney12584,"Oh my god... the problem with Trump isn't that he had documents.  It's that he had documents, he was asked for them and instead of turning them over and having his people play nice with NARA... he lied and only gave back a portion... and retained a material enough portion that they had to get a warrant to search for them.  And then dragged that out for half a year.  

And somehow there are 70 million people that will look at this and say ""THEY'RE ALL CROOKED!"" and it'll just blow completely over.  This motherfucker more likely than not got US Intelligence assets killed and wasted billions of dollars of secrecy about our satelite surveillance ability.  God damn it, Biden."
BuccaneerRex,2-1 your serve.
Immediate_Decision_2,"So they don't really say what they found because it's classified of course, but it makes me question. Are politicians being incompetent about protecting and handling classified documents? Or are the amount of documents they are given on a daily basis that are classified so high that it might as well be us leaving some weekly report used for a meeting yesterday that is completely available on your computer anyways. 

Into the mail sorter with you until you are forgotten forever"
BlandGuy,"I am truly confused how this can be. I dealt with moderately classified DoD documents (up to various TS/SCI codeword, but not really HUMINT or Q stuff) back in the 1980-2000 era and it would take a conscious effort to remove and hide a classified doc for very long.

Even that stuff was serial numbered and tracked; an officious junior security officer would physically inventory my office safes, desk, and secure spaces at least annually and compare to my list of signed-out docs, and those lists were compared to the libraries, etc - the chain was verified fairly often. The SCIFs had 24x7 security guards to ask if you had locked up your stuff, and if you were carrying anything in/out (plus random spot checks of briefcases etc) ... so there was a process which worked well enough to keep honest people from making mistakes.

Importantly, \*most\* of the hard work of audits and tracking and daily area-checks and such was done by the security team so it really didn't even impose extra stress on the rest of us.

Surely Presidents and such have the best security and admin staffs in the world, \*how\* can these documents be misplaced or misfiled, \*how\* can the team have not noticed at the very next audit? I am confused ..."
Bengerm77,"I heard a story on npr a few days ago that this is more of a case of the overuse of classification for almost everything. Routine correspondence and otherwise innocuous documents get classified at a staggering rate. Eventually, these things will turn up in everybody's possession, and if you were allowed to look at the documents themselves you might question why they were classified in the first place. As long as the people comply and the documents weren't of serious value. 

Sigh, and then there's Trump, who is clearly acting out of willful ignorance or malice in nearly every aspect of his life."
dulyebr,Never hear about Obama doing this stuff. That guy was great.
TaylorCurls,"I really hate how people are trying to group Biden, Pence, and Trump all in the same group. 

Pence and Biden are both being totally cooperative. The documents weren‚Äôt taken intentionally. I‚Äôm actually quite confident you could find classified documents at any president or former VP‚Äôs home. The media is making this into a much bigger story than it needs to be. 

Trump on the other hand took the documents purposely with malicious intent. And then REFUSED to give them back. Criminal intent matters."
Teamawesome2014,Why the fuck are classified documents ever allowed off of government property in the first place? We really are in the dumbest timeline.
bazoos,"Clearly this happens sometimes inadvertently. When determining if something done was criminal, you always have to take into account whether it was done with malice. There clearly wasn't malice involved with Pence or Biden. Trump, on the othrrhand, was given year of constant subpoenas and requests to return the cases worth of extremely sensitive documents he intentionally removed, then tried to use them as a bargaining chip. That's malice. Pence and Biden acted with good faith. There's a difference here."
DJShotKill,"Having classified docs at home is normal, what is not normal is not returning them when found or resisting it"
TheTelekinetic,">‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôd be no reason to have classified documents, particularly if they were in an unprotected area,‚Äù Pence continued. ‚ÄúBut I will tell you that I believe there had to be many better ways to resolve that issue than executing a search warrant at the personal residence of a former president of the United States.‚Äù

&#x200B;

There are better ways, Mike. Which were attempted. Multiple times, until they got fed up with Trump lying and refusing to turn over the documents they knew he had."
Bill_Brasky_SOB,"Surely, being both Biden and Pence‚Äôs documents were discovered by their lawyers and turned over immediately upon discovery, the GOP investigations will look into Pence‚Äôs actions as well‚Ä¶  
  
>	‚ÄúHe has agreed to fully cooperate with congressional oversight and any questions we have about the matter,‚Äù said Comer, adding that Pence‚Äôs transparency ‚Äústands in stark contrast‚Äù to the Biden administration‚Äôs response to Congress over the classified documents. Comer‚Äôs statement did not mention Trump‚Äôs classified documents.  
  

Ooooof course. And apparently Donnie is still above the law."
Favorite_Cabinet,Well this is going to change the fox narrative quite a bit
SeasonsGone,What I don‚Äôt get is how there isn‚Äôt some sort of chain of custody for these documents? I assume intelligence/security agencies keep a record of which officials get what documents‚Äîwhy aren‚Äôt they requesting them back when a term is complete?
