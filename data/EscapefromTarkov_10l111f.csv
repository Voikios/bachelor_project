jfazz_squadleader,Need more of this type of content on the sub! Love it
BucDan,Gotta count the money. Gotta make sure it's all there.
BobertoBoo,More tarkov adventures of this guy o7: https://youtu.be/0PsbOEXN1Iw
Madzai,"OK. You should add a part where another PMC tried to loot his kill, but was dragged into the car and extracted."
24Scoops,Absolutely hilarious. A perfect ending would have been the people who killed him walking up and buddy lets them in the car for free haha
Asthemic,"Thanks for sharing, hadn't seen this."
Walloutlet1234,"Okay, this is funny!"
TacticalBill,Please make more. This is the content we need
bullish_futuresman,"So many things in this game are designed to make the game harder for no other reason than to defy rational logic. Oh you were slick enough to remember to bring money into the raid, and survive to the point of extraction? Nope, not good enough. Now you wait. 

What's the lore? Car needs to warm up? Driver needs to finish his cigarette? Driver is waiting for his GPS to spin up so he can start moving? It's so dumb."
shaidoninja,The potential for this is staggering.
wetwaterwilly,This is good. We can use a few laughs around here.
ChefCobra,That is fecking hilarious!
d4nkn3ss,"Yooo, what the tunes name tho? Shit was a banger."
NonchalantBread,The ending should have been his toe crossing a line in the sand and the bridge sniper executing him
Potatooooes_123,Wouldn't it make more sense to use a toolkit and simply wire a car to start it. Ittakes about 60 sec and you'll need to find one
onichow_39,"Actually it make sense for waiting more people to go
It's more benefits to the taxi driver (and fence?)"
conez4,"This is top fucking tier, nice work ðŸ¤£"
FlawlessRuby,I was expecting 2 enemy PMC exchanging snack in the car after a fight outside the car when extract hit lmao
OddSensation,I'm glad you started branching off dude. Good shit ðŸ˜‚
570063,Seeing that the video was 39 seconds was a big spoiler that this extract wasn't going to go as planned
The-tall-Soviet,My theory is that he is counting the roubles and then you load the gear in the car that is why it takes that long
Hopeful_Condition_52,"Gotta count the money and load the gear... ever tried jumping into a car with a  helmet, body armour, and a filled backpack weighing 20 odd Kg and a freaking rifle?

It takes a few seconds..."
vilhardo,Any idea of the song?
Amarasnow,Not gonna lie they should do this on April fools. Buy the car next think you know uou it's partying Loyd as fuck
darkwatersinking,You forgot the part where you run and hide behind a tree.
asrielrising84,"Objectively thinking, this should be the fastest extract. I mean I costs roubles so why do you have to wait so long"
AccuracyVsPrecision,Gotta have the second pmc pay for the car after and then loot and when the time goes up he's pulled off the body and kidnapped
northand1327,"In my head canon the driver is warming it up and refuses to leave until the windows are fully defrosted. Cuz, you know, safety first"
B9mpact,Really would love to see something in the vein of Battlefield Friends but in tarkov universe
TheHoodedWonder,I'll never forget the first bugged car extract I had when I started playing on Woods. It drove off with my friends and left me even though it took my money. I ran after it like a dumbass hoping I could catch it and sniper scav put me in the dirt. Never again. My friends still shit on me for that to this day lol.
Zgerv,"I always saw it just simply ""Okay, we'll leave in a minute.""

But I love the animation. Also the track ;)"
FunstuffQC,Fantastic!
WolfKill52,"I've ran into this problem so many times in Seige that I stopped, it happened so much I thought it my game was glitched"
Upstairs_Reward,Love it!
Glad_Fig1874,Song name pls?
Linerider99, u/savevideobot
YeeYeeBeep,I've always thought about it but how are these cars running in tarkov? In a quest description I think for ragman he mentions a EMP like attack that fried most if not all electronics and vehicles in the Tarkov area. I guess it's not to unreasonable that these guys either brought them from the outside or got a bunch of new parts and fixed them but sill funny to think about and how if your running a 5-man group you have to leave someone behind cause the car can only hold another 4 people specifically.
Witt--,"This is refreshing. Some original, high quality memes on the most bitchy subreddit"
Candy_Dull,Animation is impressive well done
PharmAttack,Yooo this is fucking awesome lmao. I wish it was a little longer lol
idontagreewitu,That was good! Just need the part where he fights off the attacker and the car leaves as he's reaching for the door handle.
just-some-man,Love this!
Honest-Lavishness245,Love it - should have been hard bass though :)
JakeEngelbrecht,Famous rainbow six siege map woods
Heroiccrayfish,I imagine the car driver is just frantically trying to start the car and get the fuck out of there but keeps fuddling the keys and dropping them for a minute straight like in an 80â€™s horror film.
MaangePeenge,Anybody knows the song?
Lavotite,so the funniest thing i found out is that if someone pays for it but doesn't take take and it drives off. if they die the car comes back
Yupz69,"Well, the roubles have been up in our asses so the driver has to wipe all the poop stains from them before he can count them.ðŸ¤ "
8BitBagel,I pictured it as they try to open the door and itâ€™s locked. Then they unlock and you pull on it too quick so it locks itself again. And rinse and repeat
Mindehouse,Because realism
DenOndeBonde,"That was fucking awesome
I want moooore"
noahsark02,Need more Tarkov shorts !!! Recoil logic go go go ðŸ˜‚
DaBawks,It's a diesel and has to warm up (ignore the car already being on)
ZeflingOP,u/savevideo
LoreIsstr,Bro this is such an adorable animation I love it
arct1ccz,"I get the mechanic of countound so that your team can all pay and leave but then again, if I am solo, why do I wait for 60 seconds like dude is checking my visa status xD"
CoatAlternative1771,Bro.  It should have ended with the driver unlocking and locking the door super fast before driving away.

Alert-Ad-3099,Shocked the mods didnâ€™t remove this
