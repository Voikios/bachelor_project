DonCalzone420,I know I'm using reddit way too much when I've seen the same cosplay by the same person at least 3 times in a year and I'm not even into cosplay lol
FearTheReaper73,How many times will you post this ??
mattrhale,Again?
justsound,Your editor did a great job on this one.
pm_me_all_ur_money,honest question: You did Photoshop Aloy's face on a photo of your cosplay right?
bigtomhanks,Bruh the head looks like a CG render. How much did you post-edit. Christ.
DaleCooperTP023,CGIsplay
howie3dabber,I thought this was made in blender for a sec
Hippobu2,Weird how this looks more CGed than the actual game.
rmac1228,There's a lot of heavy editing on her face for her other cosplays...seems disingenuous.
desyx_,filters and edits are considered cosplay now ? Besides that the outfit is good
Forever_touchinGrass,RTX ON
astroshagger,can r/gaming just filter this CGI-looking BS to another sub? SO tired of seeing constant karma grab cosplays dominating a GAMING sub.
ThatFeel_IKnowIt,"Can we get these heavily post processed ""cosplay"" shitposts off this already trashed subreddit?"
Round_Rectangles,Time for the weekly likeassassin post.
drlqnr,what's the point of cosplaying when you're gonna edit the pics extensively
Toomanyaccounts2banx,"Sigh...

Cosplay is dead I guess. All this editing is NOT cosplay. The outfit is good but with all the editing I've lost all respect for it.

Anyone can look great with THIS much fucking editing holy."
Doxazo2,u/repostsleuthbot
ArcadiaFey,Soo.. what made the skin look like its a CGI render from a few decades ago? Like this doesn’t look like a person..
golgol12,The photoshop'ed head is disconcerting.
festivalofbooths,Cosplay sponsored by Nexus Mods
jerflash,This is just fucking stupid and is not cosplay… it’s cgi
eXclurel,Wasn't this the woman who did the Ellie cosplay? Her photos look fake AF. Faces are heavily processed. This is not cosplay.
NihilistBoomer247,Is this what AI cosplay looks like?
Coreys_House,Tell your editor we said good job
Zorops,Cosplay should be without photoshop. This doesnt even look like a human person.
AscendedViking7,"Way, way too much editing.



That outfit looks spot on though."
Gjjuhfrddgh,Your face is so processed it looks less realistic than the actual videogame character.
TuoFox,"The photoshopped head is messing with me. 

Also: Girl posts picture of herself to r/gaming that doesn’t have a “nudes for cash” profile challenge : Impossible"
r2-z2,Mmmmm photoshop
Unsalziges,Wait this is a cosplay??!?!
I-AM-IKARUS,"I would like to know how much is edited, is there a way to see the original picture? I guess its edited because the last of us pictures of op are i guess edited,look off to me"
schoolisuncool,"All this editing people are doing now really ruins cosplay, and makes it hard to appreciate."
Aggradocious,I really wanted this to be actual cosplay. Saying self-made feels like troll. Am disappoint.
JBCronic,"Cosplaying is terrible nowadays, you can always expect tons of editing and/or an OF link."
NaCliest,"I thought it was a 3d art render or something till I read cosplay 

It certainly looks like her lol"
Festeringhag,Anyone else tired of cosplay pics that are basically photoshopped to the point it looks like a painting...
Elarbolrojo,yes yes hot girls can wear an empty potato sack for the same effect.
bigmetalguy6,Holy crap I thought this was from the game at first glance
McDirken_Dirkenstein,Even your face is pretty much dead on. How?
eluderwrx,"Stop reposting this shit and people, stop upvoting ffs

Reported for spam"
Hanged_Man_,"I scrolled through your history and you do great work, but so does your photographer, kudos to you and them."
acecel,"Would you mind stopping reposting over and over your overly edited pictures ? There is nothing real in this, it's just editing, and the fact that you never answer any remarks or refuse to admit it is another proof of it."
Ill_Bad,Aloy is from what game? she looks good
mseg09,"That outfit looks like a lot of work

Edit: since this getting downvotes, I mean that as a compliment"
beecherJohnson88,I thought this was a screenshot from the damn game.
Toy_Cop,Not enough facial hair. 7/10
Sylarxz,"Great, but we get it

reported for spam"
Its4mechy,Damn I love overexposed in game screenshots
SarahfromEngland,She posted this exact thing to this sub 4 months ago and got 60K karma. Stop upvoting it guys it's dogwater reposts.
materics,Stop upvoting this shit y'all
strangefolk,All these cosplay photos are so touched up they look fake.
Garlador,Horizon fans never cease to amaze me.
likeassassin," I was making this cosplay about one year and almost everything is made by me ✨ hope you will like my work.
Photo by Milliganvick"
SarahfromEngland,I'm so fucking bored of this blatantly edited nonsense. Are people ashamed of their own faces now??

thefabulousbri,"A lot of people are being really awful about editing as if it isn't a skill. I am assuming with either editing or some very clever use of highlighter/makeup the face looks amazingly cgi-ed. It is definitely possible to get that look with makeup, getting the lighting right and making the character a little shiny will do that.

With that said, if it is editing, that is also really cool. A lot of work goes into a cosplay that basic editing can't do. Also editing takes work and skill so if you want to edit, do it. 

This is a phenomenal cosplay, fuck all the haters shitting on editing as if they could do the cosplay better. I thought this was a screenshot from the game, it looks so good.

TL;DR If you have issues with editing images to look more like a cosplay, go do it better and find a real example of how editing a photo COSPLAY photo is hurting anybody."
Karutsu,Your work has absolutely paid off! You have some amazing talent and picked a great cosplay for your appearance. Great job!
clemsoldaat,Where is the cosplay i only have the ingame pic
AntelopeCrafty,Great job!  Horizon is one of my favorite games and you absolutely nailed the armor.
extrafarts44,"Amazing work, that must have taken a long time to do"
jankyspankybank,I checked her account history and it doesn’t seem all that outlandish. I’m not part of the cosplay community and I don’t really had a dog in this one but I just can’t see what all the fuss is about.
OnionKnightReturns,with a massively heavy dose of photoshop
Icy-Substance-2558,Bruh i tought it was the actual game before i took a vloser look and read the title
hazyshacter,Nicely jobbed!
Festeringhag,Kalinka Fox....
MapleHamwich,Is that a mask? Face looks super plastic.
Ppleater,It's very good! Though I feel like there's a bit too much makeup around the eyes that Allow doesn't have. Still a lovely cosplay though.
1945_Dmbc,This actually looks exactly like the game
scowling_deth,"holy sh** it is Aloy,!"
hg334f14,Amazing. Respect.
SpookyIsAsSpookyDoes,"You do amazing work!! Your Ellie is my favorite, but this is a close second!"
azaghal1988,"10/10, don't see anything that looks wrong. 
Had to zoom in in multiple places to believe it's a cosplay, because your face is also incredibly similar to her in game look.

So far you are responsible for 4 of the best Cosplays I've ever seen. Big respect for your skill!"
Left_Ad7027,I thought this was a picture from the game! That is amazing!
fluffyhappysheep,"You look AMAZING, OP! You did a great job on the costume! 

I love how everyone's obsessed with your face when the actual cosplay is the awesome things you're wearing."
Help_An_Irishman,"What.

This is amazing."
HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,"It blows my mind how many people are saying this isn’t cosplay like cosplay is just a picture someone takes of themself and uploads to Reddit lmao

Y’all she’s wearing this outfit that she made IRL. Life exists outside of pictures on Reddit.

Yes, she uploaded a heavily edited image but it’s not like she’s walking around IRL looking like this image. It’s still cosplay even if she didn’t upload an unedited picture."

Semanticss,"I'm playing the game for the first time right now, and this is impeccable!"
