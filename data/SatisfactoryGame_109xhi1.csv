theGyyyrd,"The devs should use this as a ""joke"" update trailer, even though mario kart satisfactory would be an amazing update!"
alexsbz,Gravity : Am I a joke to you ?
LegendaryJimBob,"I mean they didnt say it cant climb vertical ones, they just said it can atleast do almost vertical ones"
MistaCy1,Have you made it down the other side without falling? Kinda looks possible.
AnOlympianWeeb,Idk what I want to be more impressed by the grib on that little fella or your slick use of hypertubes
