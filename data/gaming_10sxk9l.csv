craig_hoxton,"Netflix has done ""Objects of Power: in [""Archive 81""](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/80222802)...  

Loved the in-game Easter Egg of an Art Bell-style radio call-in show."
Gooleshka,Two words: Ashtray Maze
jmon25,"I love how weird Control was. Absolutely off the wall with real video segments throughout.  It was just so abstract and interesting. You never really felt like you fully had a grasp on all that was going on, but knew just enough to not make you check out."
Jayce86,"The best part? Her voice actress looks just like her, AND has live action acting experience."
Alloyd11,Wasn‚Äôt there a sequel announced?
MET4UANDME,Have you seen Severance on Apple TV? Some heavy Control vibes.
NullKingZero,_**The entire Alan Wake universe would be a terrific series**_
Equinsu-0cha,As long as they do the Finnish janitor correctly and often.  Always need more Finnish janitor
Macho-Fantastico,"You could make a cracking TV series out of Control, mixed in with some Alan Wake."
billyslits,They'd need to build out the world so the show didn't take place entirely in the oldest house. Maybe follow some teams as they track down the objects?
Von_Uber,<WE AGREE / COMFIRM THIS EXCELLENT IDEA / PROPOSAL>
JitterySquirrel,"Absolutely, HBO's answer to Stranger Things with a corporate/office based twist."
Puzzleheaded-Pear-50,"Oh man, seeing the service weapon in action must be so sweet.

Hope they don't forget a shoutout to the fridge guy."
pabodie,"The Alan Wake-a-verse would make a great TV IP.  Control is my fave, but there's a lot more to it."
Bubbagumpredditor,Could you let all the less cool kids know what the fuck game you're talking about?
spddemonvr4,"I went into that game not knowing anything about it besides a suggestion from a friend and was thoroughly surprised. 

Very good game all around with story wise and mechanics. Was sad when I finished it."
DefOfAWanderer,Fatboy Slim made one about the old Director with Christopher Walken!
Akai1up,"I liked the game overall, but tbh, I wasn't too impressed by the main story. The setting, lore, and atmosphere were all great, though. I think if they made a show, it could add more depth to the supporting characters and backstory, similar to what The Last of Us is doing.

Like TLoU, the game is a bunch of action set pieces with bits of story mixed in. The show would need to focus on the mystery and psychological thriller aspects, saving the action for crucial moments."
xtratic,"Control really reminded me of this SyFy TV miniseries called [The Lost Room](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0830361/). It‚Äôs got objects of power, motel rooms, enigmatic supernatural events, etc. It‚Äôs not amazing but at least it‚Äôs interesting and kinda stuck with me. Only 6 hrs long so not a huge time investment anyhow."
Maxtrix07,Honestly I'd take an anthology series revolving around one Altered Items or Objects of Power each episode.
Jolza,"Check out The Lost Room if you haven‚Äôt. Great mini series that has a similar vibe with objects appearing in the world, each with strange and unique powers."
hey_mattey,Please dont forget the puppets!
VigorouslySoft,*TAKE‚Ä¶CONTROL!!!!!!* ü•Å üé∏ ü§ò
flaagan,Only if they use [Stupendium's song](https://youtu.be/n6gGE9kxe1M)for the theme music / intro.
revtim,"I've been having trouble getting into new games as I get older, but that one got me.  Great game."
filmmaker30,I want the curse of monkey island lol
TyrealArchea,One of the best games I've played in forever.
thehillager0987,I want an Infamous TV series.  That would be amazing in my opinion.
aDonkus,"I honestly love the world building and the way they explain all the weird, otherworldy shit that goes down in the facility.  It's awesome.

AND SHE WALKED IN LOOKIN' LIKE DYNAMITE"
Kamakaziturtle,"I don't think you want a game about Control specifically (the overarching story in the game itself isn't really that interesting), but having a X-Files style series centered around the FBC where they go through different case files picking up different anomalies and such would be sick.  Would really allow them to flesh out the universe they started building with the game too, which was imo the best part of control to begin with."
ThisIsDefinitelyAGun,Why'd you choose such an awkward screenshot
darrylthedudeWayne,What's this?
Jesta83,What is this?
Zachosrias,"All of this was super cool but also super creepy, I barely made it through the game because it was so toe curlingly eeky... I'm not sure id want to dive into a whole show about more of this, but I get that y'all do."
VampireSurvivorsFan,If they do an adaptation it should be focused on only Ahti.
Critical_Paper8447,Stranger Things: The Adult Years
Terra_117,What game is this?
pfresh331,"This is Control, right? I bought it on sale and have yet to play it. Worth spending time to play?"
SirDingleBerryJr,I think bioshock or prey would be cool
karsh36,That could actually work - though I'd prefer an Alan Wake show
TitleComprehensive96,It will fit perfectly into a show ngl. Like maybe a 6 episode series with maybe a side-series tmfor just going over quests post projector
dhaelis,"So basically, you're just saying you want some ""Twin Peaks"" mixed in with your ""Severance"", right?"
rayshmayshmay,No more live adaptations.
matbonucci,This game is so fucked up (good) that I think no adaptation will make justice
ArchangelX1,Love this game! One of the few I actually 100%‚Äôd
NotYourBuddyGuy5,Another ‚Äúweapon of choice‚Äù music video?
thekinginyello,I want HBO to finish what they start before taking on new projects.
003_JAEGER,"JESSE

WE NEED TO FIND OUR BROTHER"
Alukrad,"They need something with a deeper story.

I say mgs."
Avocado314,"This game is a fucking gem, there aren't enough words to properly recommend it to people who haven't played it."
matrixfan0831,I loved this game and I‚Äôm still not sure what happened‚Ä¶
becauseitsnotreal,"You've gotta at least name it, idk what that is"
GandalfsWhiteStaff,"Watching someone run around an office reading random emails and memos doesn‚Äôt sound exciting, lol."
47ocean47,Big Love
socaTsocaTsocaT,I just started a second play through today! Hope there's a sequel one day!
EvilRoboEnte,@OP: watch or reade some SCP's  (YouTube or SCPwiki) xD
SarcasticGamer,The show Debris is the closest you'll get. An alien space craft broke up in Earth's atmosphere sending debris everywhere and the pieces cause all kinds of weird things to happen around where they landed. The show centers around the agents tasked to investigate and it's similar to how the FBC from the game operates.
torn-ainbow,"Control is like a mystery box, but one that has a kind of circular reasoning for existing. A bit like a time paradox which ultimately triggers itself, we accept it exists once it ties up it's own loose end. But Control still leaves a huge room for more mystery and strangeness. Despite basically being set in one building, there is massive scope and places to go after the story of the game is complete. 

Because the entire thing would be set in The Oldest House, it seems like a good candidate for 360 video wall type technology. Develop a full set of models and tools for creating and animating the retro brutalist concrete liminal spaces and offices, along with their ability to morph and change. The multi-dimensional weirdness parts could all be modeled this way too. Hang the actor from wires on that set and you can do some flying without other effects or full cgi characters.

You would have to build some physical sets for some scenes, so hopefully you could get a match between the the brutalist concrete being rendered and the irl sets. To some extent they can both look slightly otherworldly and unnatural, that's kinda what those places are."
Autostealth,"No clue who this is, OP made no mention."
oni_Tensa,I just want a Lethal League animated show
wiinintendontcare,Oh this could be a hell of a series.
Acrobatic_Math_5556,"""You're in a streaming plataform, Max""

The truth was like a green crack through my brain. Every spoken sentence displayed for the amusement of an unseen observer, glimpsed out of the corner of my eye. My every action being paused, forwarded, and backtracked in a linear sequence of events.
I was in a streaming plataform, funny as hell. It was the most horrible thing I could think of."
PentaxPaladin,"Yes, this was and is one of my favorite games for story and gameplay. Great scp vibes."
buff_bagwell1,"I want Alan Wake movies, a Control tv show and a Max Payne miniseries all together"
kujasgoldmine,"Control would be the logical choice, as the game characters have the face and voices of the actors. The story is also very fascinating and full of unanswered questions. I don't like it much when characters look so different in movie adaptations."
kaminobaka,"I mean, I just want a date on the sequel, and hope the bigger budget doesn't mean they're not going to do scenes with live actors like Dr. Darling's projectors."
Ok-Profession-3312,"I thought vigilante Marry Poppins, I‚Äôd watch that."
oldmatelefty,I downloaded this game on special and honestly couldn't get into it. I've seen a lot about it lately and may have to give it another crack
mudkripple,"Nonono, if we're gonna get a game with brutalist concrete architecture and a female lead set in the future, then my pick is **Mirror's Edge**."
Barziboy,"[It might not be Netflix-quality, but here's the Fatboy Slim adaptation](https://youtu.be/wCDIYvFmgW8)"
Cowhide12,Woah. It‚Äôs so weird seeing this as I bought the game like 4 days ago. I love it.
octane_matty,Control was cool but max Payne is OG
random314,What game is this? I really wish people would tag the game name in screen capture posts. I hate hunting comments for game titles.
DukeOfDew,I slept on this game for far too long. Finaly got around to playing it last month and did everything in all the DlCs as well. One of .y new favourite games and I can't wait for a sequel.
nopeitsnotme,"Mary Poppins remake? Awesome!

I have no idea what game this is referencing."
Earthwick,"Alan wake first, then this show, then a prequel show about the oldest house, then the dlc show where she is fighting Mr. Scratch or whatever he calls himself I'm AWE."
WhatDoesN00bMean,What game is this?
North_Scribe01,Floating woman?
rootpl,"Nah, give to to people who made Apple TV+ Severance."
Finlander95,Next Alan Wake is going to be great game
HowVeryReddit,"Problem is the best parts of the story are environmental worldbuilding interactables, hard to fit into a show."
No-Row-6397,Yes! Control is just perfect for a TV show format!
TJL-91,"I actually think Alan Wake would be a great show to adapt but only as a single series. No dragging it out, tell the story well and end it. Probably adapt game 2 as a 2nd season later down the line."
cubus31415,Control: The Movie
Gecko2002,What game?
RevScarecrow,"Ill be honest i think this game was very whatever and I'm absolutely confused on why it has a following at all. Personal taste I'm sure but the plot was just SCP rip offs, the gun play was awkward and stilted, the core gameplay loop was just attempting to understand an awful map and doing the same missions over and over. What is it about this game yall like so much?"
jak94c,"Again, can we get the game the post is talking about in the post title somewhere? I have no idea what this is."
EloquentGoose,I'm so glad this game eventually got the love it did. Back in 2019 it was polarizing for some reason. Super happy to see it's become a mega hit.
Trad-Sidepiece,"I didn‚Äôt think too much of the plot during my first lap since I was pretty preoccupied with the gameplay. 2nd time around I really sunk my teeth into all the log entries, and honestly, it‚Äôs gotta be one of the best sci-fi experiences out there."
PabloMarmite,I have it as more of a movie than a TV show
Bailenstein,If they ever made this they damn better cast Courtney Hope.
AAAAAAYYYYYYOOOOOO,Fuck yes and use the same actress please
ProNerdPanda,"Unpopular opinion but Control didn‚Äôt click with me, the writing and voice acting felt cringe, the constant self talk and blatant exposition became unbearable after the first hour and I stopped playing because of it."
SardonicSeraphim,An HBO-miniseries for this would be perfect.
Rocketeer1019,"Just downloaded Control, never played it and I know nothing about it but Reddit convinced me it was a fun game lol"
TepidAtmosphere,"Directed by David Lynch, written by Chris Carter."
SpaghettiRevisionist,I'd also love a Mass Effect show.
ShlomoShogun,"Mmmhhh, I want to see them adapt Goldeneye into a movie."
Kelsen404,Meh
Lord-of-the-junk,No thx
ThisGaren,Perfect dark?
the908bus,I want to know why a former director is locked in a tank
,[deleted]
zachtheperson,"A lot of games don't make good adaptations, but I could definitely see Control's weird world working out well. Might be just a tad too close to severance for producers to fully be on board though, at least until that show wraps up.

Usually the question is ""What would a movie/show add to the experience of the game?"" which fails 99% of the time. For this an episodic, borderline anthology type show would probably work very well with all of the Objects of Power being given their own story x-files style."
BrutusGregori,"Battletech fans would love a politics heavy/infantry combat show. Mechs are supposed to be rare and super scary when they are fighting. 

PPC back wash can cook a man."
lancer2238,Honestly I‚Äôm surprised this hasn‚Äôt happened yet
BruisedWater95,SCP x X-files
DeevesKeys528,Ooo good call!   I just started playing this yesterday.  Just got to the black rock quarry.
lecorbusianus,Katie Siegel would be so good in this
Yttermayn,Oh fuck yessssss!
Pemburuh_Itu,Oh fuck that would be so good.
Ebolatastic,Expected a bad suggestion.  This is a perfect one.
migs2k3,What a wild ride this would be
paq1kid,That would actually be pretty cool tv series to watch lol
tawzerozero,"Well, time to go listen to a Finnish janitors Walkman~"
Bob_Sconce,Is that an umbrella?  Is this like an action-hero Mary Poppins?
foreverbeatle,I really need to finish this game. I loved what I played of it so far.
cgtdream,Fuck. Yes.
dddanedavis,We're not ready for this adaptation.
Sgim93,The game is one of my favorites‚Ä¶ but it just barley made sense lol
HandspeedJones,This would be dope.
shadow69xxx,Control. Good game to
physchy,Should I pick this back up? I got to around when that guy shot himself in the head which I‚Äôm pretty sure is technically still tutorial
Drakeadrong,Anybody seen Severance? The whole office setting gives me a lot of control vibes
notgodpo,I don't even know what this is ;(
kalitarios,I really need to finish this game
D-Sleezy,"MY GOD, YES! 

That scp, liminal space vibe is RIGHT UP MY ALLEY."
leonmo,"This game is really stressful‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs the voices that really get to me, but the suspended bodies are pretty disturbing too."
turboS2000,Now that would be a fucken great show
Tyna_Sama,The game that I was never able to finish. It's so hard :/
MilitaryFish,lmao
unmerciful_DM_B_Lo,"I couldn't fucking get past the dude who regenerates their heath to full in like 1.5 seconds. Henderson i think? I even tried to cheat and hide on the roof thing. Nothing worked. Stopped after that. 

Loved the game though."
darkeningsoul,Such a great game and aesthetic. Could be new age x files
Romanmir,I would seriously consider getting HBO if this was a thing.
Jackdejedi,"As long as they keep the soundtrack in, I‚Äôm happy. That maze music (take control) is great"
niece_denise,What about dead space!!
MimsyIsGianna,I got this game for free but I haven‚Äôt played it yet. It‚Äôs definitely up there for a game I wanna play when I get more time
blindspot189,epic games gave that game to me for free...worth giving it some time?
Mindtaker,"It would be a hell of a lot of a better then if they did a fucking X-Files reboot and it would scratch the exact same itch.  While simultaneously being the modern version of weird and creepy, with endless potential for amazing one off episodes."
GameVoid,"""Shawshank Redemption!"""
SpaceLemming,What is it?
majornerd,Hell yes!!!
nacho_taco2,Control
TheAtomAge,Let games just be games
cockmasterwarlord,"control, life is strange, quantum break, beyond two souls, bully, detroit become human, bioshock, dead space, la noire, metro exodus (or just the entire metro series in general), mafia, a plague tale, etc. there‚Äôs so many games that hbo can choose from tbh. i just know it‚Äôll be a great adaptation if it‚Äôs on hbo"
Electricengineer,Which is what? I must not know..
Restivethought,"I wouldnt want the actual game story done, but would love a modern day X Files with this games Universe."
Strange_Public_1897,"Well Amazon just finished the first season of the ‚ÄúFallout‚Äù adaption, my best guess, since John Carpenter let it slip out that ‚ÄúDeadspace‚Äù is getting adapted (he only mentioned it cause he passed on the opportunity to helm it), but ‚ÄúControl‚Äù might be made if ONLY they make it workable for tv since a few things are going to hella difficult to work on the screen. I say this as working in makeup for the film industry and some stuff will not work on screen and night water down the actual plot of the video game if it‚Äôs adapted."
Romnonaldao,What game?
AnustusGloop,I would absolutely love this in twelve episodes. David Lynch should consult
kawaiineko333,Are we sure we‚Äôre ready for live-action adventures of Traffic Control?
ttubehtnitahwtahw1,It's too deep for the average audience.
GhoulslivesMatter,"Same, Loved shows like the X-files growing and Control tapped that guilty pleasure of mine, now I just really want a TV series of Alan Wake and Control."
Hurticane313,Watch the sci fi show the library
archangelmv,Control would be so fucking great.  Get some Alan Wake live action going with it.
Snooklefloop,"This is the only game to nearly melt my xbox one ""out of  video memory""  11/10 Game though"
AltsOnDeckLol,the matrix??
