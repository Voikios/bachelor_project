Homunculus_87,"Money totally buys freedom, free time and plenty of other nice stuff that sure can help make you happier or at least less miserable. Only people who never struggled financially can say that money isn't important."
CharmingTuber,"I've always thought about it like water. If you have a lot of water, like most people in the western world do, you aren't very happy with more water. It makes very little difference to me if I get more water.

But if you don't have enough water, if you're worried about when your kids will get their next drink, it's impossible to really focus on anything else like being happy.

Money won't make you happy, but a lack of it will make it impossible to have a happy life."

However, money is great at making many thinks that make you unhappy disappear.

Bills? Gone

Feeling unsafe because you can only afford the cheapest neighboorhood with high crime rates? Gone

JoeGang_orNothing,"I know it's just a meme and for hahas and hihis, but for anyone who needs to hear this....money spent on things like that only buys you a distraction from the ever existing pain of being alive.

BiH-Kira,"It doesn't buy happiness indeed. But it helps you find happiness by giving you the means to search more and easier. Like you can have more free time, you can buy things you want but couldn't, it removes a lot of stress and worries from your life, it helps you hang out with the people who bring you happiness, do the things that bring you happiness.

I'm 33 and right now I'm living the happies years of my life, never before was I as happy as now. Why? Because I'm earning enough money to be able to support myself, help my parents, buy many things I've always wanted, enjoy more free time by spending money on things I would otherwise have to do myself, have financial security and almost no uncertainty which reduced my biggest stress factors, and a big things, I can afford to pay a good professional psychologist who helps me deal with all my issues.

It certainly doesn't guarantee happiness, but it turns the game's survival element from hardcore Dark Souls naked run into Animal Crossing difficulty."

Blazing_Donut,"Money may not buy you happiness, but it sure does buy you opportunities to be happy."
randomguy987654321,"America is a civil oligarchy.

Money will buy you the following: freedom, control over the entire legal system, your very life depending on what medical problems you have, friends/sex/wife, comfort and security, a ""get out of jail free"" card (not valid if you fuck over OTHER oligarchs), and with enough of it...it's very easy to own a human being for whatever reason you need them for.

So it literally gets you everything."
FofoPofo01,"# I agree in a way. It depends where you are in life.


If your basic needs are met and more money would just mean more disposable income for toys and wants then I agree it does not make you happy in the long run.

More stuff does not buy you happiness. Trust me, the more shit you own the more it owns you.

By this I mean you fear loss of material goods but each new material acquisition brings you a marginal amount of happiness if any at all.

It is never as good when you only owned a couple of things but still you made do with so little and then you upgraded. Yes, newer stuff is exciting but after a while material goods hit a saturation point and more stuff becomes a lateral move in terms of being happier.

I‚Äôm not even rich and yet as middle class I already feel this way.

**But on the other hand**, more financial mobility and having your basic needs met DOES bring happiness and satisfaction.

Just being able to go to the store and buying food and not worrying about insufficient funds or being able to pay rent, utilities and not needing to worry how you‚Äôll get by next month and beinf able to save.

That DOES mean happiness to the most destitute."

Iaxacs,Fun fact: there is a correlation between happiness and wealth up to $100k/year (probably $120k now) after that point the correlation dies off because with that $100k you can provide yourself with any basic needs and have the ability to get most wants as a bonus
MrFIXXX,"A bit of an alternate take, having ""money"" for me is having bills paid, and knowing there's enough money even if some bigger bills come in.

And having enough money if someone falls ill for a few weeks and you can pay all the bills. 

Enough money to buy a new pair of good shoes and seasonal clothing for the child.

The good brand of nappies instead of searching around for a better deal while you buy the ones that are a bit worse but still okay enough.

And knowing there's enough for a modest vacation of 7-10 days that could take place a bit less than a year in the future.

And, finally, being able to NOT work for 2 weeks while you decompress, fix that effin' door handle that's too stiff and noisy, and find a handyman with an angle-grinder to fix something else. 

""Stuff"" is fine, but less important than the above, IMO."

razersnek,Only an idiot can have money and remain miserable.
fitthelvete,"It feels like people deliberately misinterprete the saying ""money can't buy happiness"". All it's meant to say is that there's an upper bound for when more money doesn't improve you life in any significant way and there are certain things you can never buy with money; Real friendship, real love and a real sense of happiness. No one's debating that financial strain doesn't affect your well being with all the stress that comes with it. But removing that stress doesn't make you  automatically happy, it only gives you a better prerequisite to achieve some kind of happiness.

jordantask,"Material possessions aren‚Äôt ‚Äúhappiness.‚Äù They might make you happy for a while, but ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù is a fleeting thing that typically only lasts for a short period anyway. You‚Äôre happy when you‚Äôre laughing your ass off at a comedy show or playing a game or whatever it is, then it goes away.

The real brass ring here is ‚Äúcontentment,‚Äù that state of feeling as though literally everything is fine, and those things not fine are going to work out in the end. Money buys a shit ton of that, since you‚Äôre paying the bills, have a comfortable roof, have acceptable food, and enough for diversions."
