No-Owl9201,Congress in currently broken because of Kevin McCarthy's ongoing support for the other delusional liar George Santos
specqq,"He saved the very best for last

""You asked me a question. When I answer it, it's the answer to your question. **You don't get to determine whether I answered your question or not, okay?** In all respect,"" McCarthy snapped.

No Kevin. Not Okay. That's not okay at all. In fact, that's the opposite of okay."
Amazing-Day965,Kevin knows it’s broken because he helped break it.
iheartbbq,"This guy is probably the weakest speaker in the last 50 years. I can't remember any single speaker who has had less control over his coalition and members. What a unbelievable joke the GOP has become. 

Also, Kevin's media handler has to be a newby, this was an obvious question that was going to be hammered on and which he should have been thoroughly prepped for."
409024072546630,"Republicans have no answers. We know this because we know their actual purpose. Use government to maintain the status quo via any means necessary. 

As long as Santos is willing to uphold the status quo he’s an asset for republicans. Nothing else matters to them."
Sea_Dawgz,What a piece of shit that man is.
Whiskey_Fiasco,"When Republicans commit fraud, it’s anyone’s fault but Republicans."
StructureOk5668,I’ve seen him lash out too many times now in the same bizarre way. anytime anyone asks him a question he completely goes off topic for several seconds never getting to a point and yells at them for “interrupting”….it is so frustrating seriously how can anyone vote for these absolute clowns
Any_Property_7405,"Sidestep? You don’t let these guys sidestep, this lame practice is part of how we got where we are. Pointed, unrelenting questions are overdue and when there is no answer, the headlines read McCarthy Refused - on each and every topic/question launched. C’mon, media."
invisiblegirlx,"Kevin, you are congress!"
DangerBay2015,"What a flaccid, mealy-mouthed, gutless worm McCarthy is. The single most powerless, tepid hack to ever hold the Speakership."
AnnabananaIL,"I watched Margaret Brennan ask him multiple times to answer her question about George Santos.  At one point the words ""Hunter Biden"" were heard."
TranquilSeaOtter,"Yes Kevin, Congress is indeed broken when you decide to support a shit bag like Santos."
Mediocre-Statement98,"He broke it, what's he complaining about."
Bulky_Promotion_5742,"I saw this today. McCarthy is a tool. Didn’t answer anything, just talked about nothing."
DavidGlennCox,"Dodge, sidestep and avoid. George Santos is the anchor around Kevin McCarthy's neck. Kevin wants talk about a broken Congress and George Santos has broken the Republican Party."
LazyAnonBoner,Talking about “congress being broken” when you are literally in charge of congress is some real frontier gibberish.
WeaselTeamSix,"Everything broken about Congress is connected to, or directly because of, Republicans ratfuckers like himself."
TahitiJones09,Congress is broken? If only Kevin could find the man in charge and talk to him about it!
Czeris,"""Kevin, why are you breaking this window?""

""I'm breaking this window because the window is broken."""
Tonald-Drump-666,Not sure why so many are surprised that Santos just keeps slugging along and answering for nothing and why Kevin doesn't do anything about him. Kevin is beholden to the biggest liar in the history of liars. Trump walked so the rest could run.
takatori,"Congress is broken??

Kevin, _you're in charge of Congress._"
Inner_Impress_6777,"She should have said, “no, I do get to determine if you’re being responsive to my questions or not.  It’s my show.  If you’re not going to answer my questions, get off my show.”"
dastufishsifutsad,GOP is a trash bag.
bham_cactus_dude,"“You don’t get to decide if I answered your question or not…..”

Yes, yes he does. If you avoided the question, you sure as shit didn’t answer it. God I hope the democrats run quality candidates to vote for, cause the repubs are way out in right field."
illjustputthisthere,"I watched it. Margret did best when she fact checked his ""theae democrats have increased spending by 30% over the last four years"". He did it twice before she reminded him two of those years were trump and accounted for 25% of the increase over four years. So anyone watching who actually is engaged with politics knew he came prepared to be overly disingenuous.

It all just sets up the fact we have a no idea house whos only position ""is not your position"". He's not going to be able to thread this. A more talented politician would have a problem but he's just not quick enough and peopwton his own caucus dont trust him. Such a terrible representation sent by our right party and awful for our country."
SwayzeOfArabia,Fuck the gop
Gruffstuff2021,Congress is broken because Republicans broke it.
Liquidmetalballs,"https://twitter.com/henryrodgersdc/status/1618062779616997376/mediaviewer

The same Kevin McCarthy, ladies and gentlemen, who said he removed Schiff and Salwell from the Intel committee because “they lied” and “Integrity matters to me!” I don’t know how he can say that with a straight face when he was literally asked about why Santos is on House committees when he removed Schiff and Sallwell from their committee assignments."
NotmyRealNameJohn,yes congress is broken.  That is how Kevin got to be speaker.
Profound-Madman,"""Congress is broken"" the guy currently in charge of Congress... Nailed it"
Erazerhead-5407,"So to avoid speaking about George Santos, he side steps the question and decides rather to speak about how Congress is broken knowing that it’s his side of the aisle, the republican party that is irreparably broken in Congress. Yet another display of intellectual vacancy from the party of Proud Losers."
Callabrantus,"I'm convinced that when George Santos created his resume, he just copied a list of Chuck Norris jokes, crossed out Chuck Norris and wrote his own name."
DashCat9,I terrifies me that people vote for this guy.
BrutalOutThere,Only a Republican would lack the self-awareness to describe the thing they are in charge of as “broken”.
TongueTwistingTiger,"When do the GOP start just making random sounds or speaking gobbledygook in response to questions they don’t want to answer? 

He’s the *SPEAKER* of the *HOUSE*, god damn it! Zero scruples on Republicans. This man is an embarrassment."
holeMemphisCactus,"Typical deflect and whataboutisms, typical effective move"
3dddrees,"McCarthy has no principles, he has no morals, he has no credibility, and he has absolutely no ethics. McCarthy is a POS and has shown to be willing to do anything in order to get Speaker of the House to include give all the powers that came with the position in order to get the position. Not only that but he has proven that he stands for absolutely nothing but wants to get that position above all else. Plain and simple McCarthy above all else needs every single Republican in the House he can possibly get no matter what a POS they are. Hell he wouldn't even vote to impeach Trump after Jan6 what George Santos has done is small potatoes when compared to Trump."
RedLanternScythe,He also said he put election deniers on related committees because he wants all voices heard. So he endorses election denial.
OudeStok,Not only did he sidestep the question - as most of the MAGA fascist politicians do. He avoided all questions and simply used the 'interview' as a free platform to spout his propaganda. This is how Kellyanne Conway also used journalists as free publicity. You would think the media would have learned by now - but apparently not!
thefriendlycouple,Congress is broken BECAUSE of people like Kevin McCarthy and  George Santos
Fomentor,"“Congress is broken,” said the majority leader of the party that broke it."
AndISoundLikeThis,"Reminder that this piece of shit, unfortunately, is a PUBLIC SERVANT. He should be answering questions about the job WE ARE PAYING HIM TO DO."
Jmersh,Broken in the sense that a speaker can lose a vote 14 times in the same session for the same person and still force another one?
Milozdad,“You don’t get to decide whether I answer your question. Only Marjorie Taylor-Greene can decide if I answer your question.”
AllTheyEatIsLettuce,"""Government is broken and I'm here to make sure it is!""

-- these people"
zotha,"""I mean they made *ME* speaker. How much more evidence do you need that it is broken beyond repair?"""
hedgerow_hank,Yep - congress is broken. It's full of lying assed republicans who'd rather burn down the country than pass legislation that's good for it.
Lingering_Dorkness,Every reporter needs to keep asking McCarthy about Santos until he actually answers. No let up.
Commercial-Prompt-84,The only reason he sidestepped the question is because he was allowed to.
TbonerT,“Congress is broken” said the guy in charge of a large part of it. Taking responsibility hasn’t been something Republicans do for some time now.
SurlyBob,I wish politicians answered the questions they are asked.
BreezyMoonTree,Barely sentient corrupt heap of garbage shaped like a human.
Maleficent_Ad_5175,He says Congress is broken as he continues to pour sugar into the gas tank.
freakonomics101,"A disrespectful asshole who just made a complete ass of himself. 

I can’t believe how disrespectful he was, **on camera.**

I could tell she wanted him to leave."
Bastdkat,Congress IS broken. It was broken by people like George Santos and Kevin McCarthy.
RedditRadicalizingMe,Kevin McCarthy does not have the United States best interest in my mind. He should be fired and republicans should elect better people to our government.
Charming-Chard7558,"I’m not sure what more absurd and insulting to viewers-

His fake bullshit “I’m calm and a nice-guy” shtick he said as trying here.

Or the CBS control room that just let him skate and shut her down prematurely."
smiama6,"And that's what Republicans have been doing - and getting away with - for years.  Ducking the microphones, dodging the questions and ignoring the public.  Media always plays softball with the Republicans and Republicans understand that media will fall all over themselves to bothsides it.  Americans should be sick and tired of being gaslighted by mainstream media."
testedonsheep,it's broken because republicans are not there to do their job.
RammsayB,"The Republican Party is out of control and McCarty is the weakest speaker in a century due to being held hostage by the extreme of the extreme.

The party needs eradicated asap before they make matters worse.

Signed a life long Republican until 2016 when the party started to lose its mind.

Ninja edit: or maybe had already lost its mind. In any case that’s when I jumped ship. Had I stayed I’d be a RINO anyways so it’s not like they’d care."
SapientChaos,Love how he lowers his vocal tones the guy is pure slime.
ParusMajor69,Now if only he'd also recognize that he's part of the reason it's broken
TracyVance,\#KevinMcCarthy = Trash
Optimal_Aide_1348,"Really, all I got out of his giddy self import arrogant display was he had a weird kid trying to ""fit in"" vibe. And those socks. Nope. Can't take him seriously."
Heinrich_Bukowski,“i agree wholeheartedly that congress is broken and i for one plan to do everything i can to keep it that way”
nightly_nukes,What an absolutely pathetic weasel.
Yitram,"He's right, congress is broken when it refused to punish one of its own for literally fabricating his entire life to get voted into office."
alexbeeee,"The media always allows them to deflect, why not just keep asking the same question until you get a straight answer instead of letting them go on some rant til the viewer forgets"
oldbastardbob,"Hey, at least he admits the the GOP has broken Congress."
Mysterious-Wasabi103,"This guy is so slimy, smug and toxic. His whole thing was ""because of Democrats I can do whatever I want"" and it's just hard to watch. For one second, let's just pretend you aren't completely mischaracterizing a whole party. Why is it when you guys do worse it's completely acceptable? How does that help? It's only broken because you've broken it dude. The gaslighting is intense with this guy and his ""what about?"" Like gtfo"
Samurai_gaijin,">Congress is broken.

""Elect me and I'll prove it.""

-GQP"
Chus_ugh,"Santos needs to go. If he won’t resign, the Republicans should expel him from congress."
weelluuuu,"He claimed the people made their choice. NO the people were duped, and now that they know they want Santos OUT. His fellow GOP in the state want him OUT. GET HIM OUT !"
Song_Spiritual,"He broke it, he bought it."
Frozenthickness,"Republicans have no integrity, Kevin McCarthy just comes off as stupid and beta in this interview. What a loser."
TerminatedProccess,"In other words, fuck you and fuck America? He's such a tool."
QFugp6IIyR6ZmoOh,The body that elected you is broken? You don't say.
Crowbar_Faith,"Everytime the reporter asked about troubles or controversy in his party or his decisions, he immediately deflected with what about-isms rather than answering the questions."
Bigdaddylovesfatties,Kevin McCarthy is a shitstain on California. He sold his dignity to be a powerless speaker.
SpecterOfGuillotines,"Reporters need to be even more blunt.

“The question was about George Santos, and you responded that Congress is broken. Do you mean to say that you and your caucus are all as corrupt as Mr Santos? Or were you changing the subject?”"
dual_gear,Watching Republican Speakers slowly lose all thier credibility over the years would be entertaining if it was so disgusting.
ByWilliamfuchs,Ya and You broke it
AllPurposeNerd,"It would be such a layup to oust this guy. He lied to get where he is, he's a crossdresser so it should be super easy to make his base hate him, but they'll never do it because he's on their team (they think)."
Stormcrow6666,"When they aren't held accountable by the media, by the electorate, and by their oaths of office...is it still a democracy?"
Geezer__345,"The same is true, of Representative Jim Jordan's appearance, on ""Meet The Press"", today:  He monopolized the conversation, ""talked over"" Chuck Todd; and wanted to concentrate on Joe, and Hunter Biden, while ignoring his own, Donald Trump's, and other Republicans' shortcomings.  He also has no proposals, or plans; to ""clean up"" any of the messes, in This Country.  ""Clean up, The Swamp""?  He, and The Republican Leadership; are the biggest alligators, IN the Swamp!; and events will prove Me, right."
Hiranonymous,"McCarthy tried to pull the same schtick he did last week.

When he didn’t answer the question and started going off on a diatribe against Democrats, she interrupted him.  McCarthy then condescendingly tried to correct reporter Brennan and said that it was entirely up to him to how he answered.

Speech on network air time isn’t free.  Politicians like McCarthy need to be shown the door when refusing to answer legitimate questions and waste air time to make political speeches."
bx35,"I know him. He is very, very, very dumb."
heavensmurgatroyd,If America makes it through the next two years I really think the Republicans are done and done.
thecloudcities,"McCarthy: *breaks Congress by putting unqualified charlatans and liars on committees instead of holding them accountable for their BS*

Also McCarthy: ""Congress is broken."""
sistermj536,"I can’t stand that fake smile, slimy, snake oil salesman.  Can’t believe he’s in such a position of power.  SMH."
doesnt_reallymatter,What a huge flex. /s “We finally have a majority in the house and now all of a sudden congress is just broken.” Weak ass speaker of the house.
TreeChangeMe,Gaslight Obstruct Project
Eu_Gravida_Vendatur,"I mean yeah, of course it is, the house majority leader won’t even discuss the liar in congress."

Timely_Look7855,"Deflection is as good to a Republican as is, I don't recall, I don't remember and my favorite line is I plead the fifth. Criminals and racist homophobic misogynist lying hypocrites."
welltriedsoul,Sound like a good follow up question should have been. What are your plans to fix this when the people can’t trust who they are voting for such as with George Santos?
Farty_Nonsense,Kevin McCarthy is the most useless moron ever made. An idiot in a party of idiots.
Smitty8054,"I’m just thrilled.  

Not that our country will get better with this asshat.  

But that his smile covers the fact that he has a very short fuse.  And it’s easy to get under his skin. 

So he’s going to provide many meltdown moments for our enjoyment for some time to come.  

You didn’t ask for this.  You begged for it. 

Enjoy"
craxinthatjazz,Scumbag mother fucking republican
djbk724,He is a terrible leader. Leaders would handle the hard questions. He is just another politician and even worse casue the gop only cares of power and running peoples lives. Santos is a complete fraud and should be banned from office until he runs an actual campaign based on facts
LoJoPa,He is just so slimey
Firepower01,The Republican party is such an embarrassment. They're going to get blown out of the water in 2024.

Charming-Chard7558,"“And how did it break, Kevin? Perhaps by partisanship so rancorous you let a complete and abject fraud keep his seat so you can maintain more votes? Could it be things like that, KEVIN?!”"
AffectionateTie1849,Congress is purposely broken. The wealthy and the corporations require it. The GOP sold out the American people in the 1950s by attacking public education and promoting the pulpit. The result is:  our voting public is just smart enough to respond to slogans and react to fear / hate.
Revolutionary-Ad4588,"     “You don’t get to question whether I answer it.” 

You’re the House Speaker.  You answer to the public.  You aren’t a deity"
Maleficent-Blood8070,"Of course he won't own up to anything a member of his party does wrong. Congress is broken because in his mind the Republicans aren't in the majority. Party loyalty, not ethics and morality lead in what the Grand Old Party has become."

Kevinmc479,"Santos is trumpism 101, Big Fat must be proud."
loondawg,"Damn I miss having people like Tim Russert who used to be the host of Meet the Press. He was one of last good ones on the Sunday morning politics shows. He never would have let that by pass by like that.

When politicians used to try this with him, he would first listen patiently while they talked. And when they finished, he would say ""I don't think I heard an answer to my question in there."" and ask the question again. If they did the same thing again, he would explicitly call them out and say ""It looks like I'm not going to get an answer to my question."" 

And if they had dared try why McCarthy just did, telling the host she does not get to decide if he answered the question **that she asked**, he would have had a nice little talk with him to explain that of course he got to decide if he heard an answer to the question.

We can't continue to tolerate this shit. This is the Sarah Palin ""answer the question you want to, not the question they asked"" approach. They should ban McCarthy until he starts following the rules. And if they can't do that, they should run a disclaimer banner every single time he talks warning people that he has a history of failing to engage in honest dialog."

Jordan_Jackson,"I'll agree that congress is broken but not because of the reasons that he listed.

For one, every elected official should have term limits. If the president and many other offices do, then why not senators, congressional representatives and even supreme court justices?

Campaign donations and finance in general is just a mess. First, bar corporations and religious organizations from being able to donate anything. Too many politicians are bought nowadays and it really makes me sick to see how they are the ones that hold the amount of influence over our country that they currently do. Next, each and every politician should be required to release a full and unabridged statement of all campaign finances, for transparency. Make this available to view for all who wish to scrutinize it. 

We have 2 major parties and only two parties with any real chance of being a part of the government. The other parties we have are either way too small and will probably never get to the level of republicans and democrats or they are some fringe/extremist party such as the tea party. Why are we so stuck in this mindset that there can only be 2 viable parties? It definitely works in other countries and with effort, it could work here too.

Lastly, there is no compromise anymore and any relationship needs compromise at some point. Nobody is willing to find the middle ground. Politics have turned into this life or death war of ""my way or the highway"" and it ends up with us not getting anything meaningful accomplished or with watered-down solutions. 

The government is supposed to work for the people but it feels like they only work for themselves. There are some politicians that I feel would be more than happy to rewrite the constitution or wholly abolish it, just to keep themselves in power or line their pockets."

Neil_Fallons_Ghost,"Saying it’s broken doesn’t fix it and when you propose your fixes it always has the poorest suffering.

Commercial-Archer-52,Was it just me or was his smile like so out of place in the wrong spots during the interview? It was so odd to me the way he smiled after the things that he said. It’s as though the smile did not match his words; Or his eyes
Geneological_Mutt,Fuck him. Karma is a mother fucker in the form of historians who will destroy his name for future generations to read about
bigsam2,"Fuck this traitor piece of shit. He should be on trial for aiding and abetting treason, NOT THE SPEAKER IF THE HOUSE. This guy would sell his own mother, much less his country."

DavidGlennCox,"The invertebrate specimen known to science as Kevin McCarthy. Appeared on Face the Nation to tell America all about the broken Congress and Kevin’s plans to fix it. But the first question asked was about George Santos. Kevin ducked and side stepped dodged, bobbed and weaved. Trying with all his might to not answer an obvious question. What did Kevin expect? What does Kevin still expect? That this issue of public fraud and public deception will just go away? If George Santos is still on the Congressional payroll in 2024. A lot of other House Republicans won’t be."
EmEffArrr1003,The house and Senate worked really well when they passed the dozens of bills Biden signed into law for the last 2 years.  Where does this dysfunction come from if not the GOP?
SkipWestcott616,"The...committee of people he's in charge of leading... is broken...?

Not a very clever fellow, is he?"
Alostcord,"Excuse me.. congress is broken??  Hmmm, then YOU are part of the problem McCarthy!

Justandy85,"""The Congress we proudly broke is broken."""
climbhigher420,"Person with no credibility can’t talk about credibility, it is funny to think his answer would be credible even if he gave an answer."
copargealaich,McCarthy is right. Except he runs half of Congress. And his party is to blame.
LandosMustache,"“Congress is broken”

“As in, there’s an elected official who has appeared to have lied about literally everything, and broke a lot of campaign finance laws, and is somehow allowed to keep making laws?”

“No, that part is working the way we like it to”"
clarkwgriswoldjr,"The other part of this is that they know exactly how many minutes they can be on, so they can stall it out to arrive at a situation like this.

I'd like to have you back, I'd like to be back, to answer your questions."
