KinkyKitty24,"In his deposition, Trump actually said that E Jean Caroll said she ""liked"" being raped by Trump in an interview with Anderson Cooper. Wallace then played the interview and (shockingly) Caroll said no such thing."

cwood1973,"The [depo transcript](https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2023/01/trump-deposition.pdf) is nuttier than a jar of peanut butter.

The transcript opens with Carroll's testimony. Trump's testimony starts on page 15 of 48 (numbered page 125). A few examples:

-----------------------------

**Trump:** Now, like everyone else, she gets paid by a radical, left-leaning publisher to say bad and untrue things.""

**Carroll's Attorney:** Do you know who her publisher was?

**Trump:** No. I just heard it was a publisher that did some very bad books on us.

-----------------------------
**Carroll's Attorney:** And as of today, you have approximately four million followers on Truth Social?

**Trump:** I don't know the number. I know Truth Social is doing very well. I think it was number one ahead of TikTok, number one ahead of Twitter, number one ahead of Instagram and everyone else for the last number of days. I just noticed that. Somebody put it on my desk. They have the ratings, and they said Truth Social is hot.

-----------------------------
**Carroll's Attorney:** Why did you decide to issue [the statement](https://lawandcrime.com/trump/e-jean-carroll-signals-plans-to-file-new-defamation-claim-against-trump-over-truth-social-post-calling-rape-allegations-a-hoax-and-a-lie/) on Truth Social on October 12th?

**Trump:** Because I was offended at this woman's lie. Because I was offended that she could just make up a story out of cold air, refuted by her testimony on CNN, but that she could make up a story just out of nowhere and that I get a phone call asking me about this ridiculous situation. The woman -- there's something wrong with her in my opinion. Okay. But it's a false accusation. Never happened, never would happen. And I posted and I will continue to post until such time as -- and then I will sue her after this is over, and that's the thing I really look forward to doing. And I'll sue you too because this is -- how many cases do you have? Many, many cases, and I know the statements that were made -- that you made. Keep Trump busy because this is the way you defeat him, to keep him busy with litigation. So I will be suing you also, but I'll be suing her very strongly as soon as this case ends. But I'll be suing you also. 

**Carroll's Attorney:** Are you done?

**Trump:** Yeah."
zehalper,"I would've be more surprised if it was 
> Donald Trump ""caught telling the truth"" during deposition"
MyWifeIsTheGreatest,Serious question for the legal minds here- Are there any real repercussions/consequences for lying during a deposition?
taez555,Only in his deposition?    The only thing the man has *never* lied about in his life is being erotically attracted to his own daughter.
MagicMushroomFungi,"""For the record, will you state your name...""     
""David Dennison"""
Jan_17_2016,"He also basically admitted to raping Jean Caroll. 

From WaPo:

““She actually indicated that she loved it. Okay?” Trump said in the deposition. “In fact, I think she said it was sexy, didn’t she? She said it was very sexy to be raped.”

Kaplan then asked: “So, sir, I just want to confirm: It’s your testimony that E. Jean Carroll said that she loved being sexually assaulted by you?”

And Trump answered: “Well, based on her interview with Anderson Cooper, I believe that’s what took place.”"
meatball402,"So he lied in a deposition.  Was it sworn? If it was sworn, wasn't that perjury?"
readyfuels,"Jesus Christ, [the transcript](https://www.scribd.com/document/620217200/gov-uscourts-nysd-590045-16-2-1#from_embed) for this has some real word salad. I know this idiot's mental decline has been going on for a while, but he's gotten so incoherent."
sapientia-maxima,"For normal people, this would be considered perjury and we'd find ourselves in prison. Trump is making sure everyone in the world knows without question that there are two justice systems in the United States."

was_and_wasnt,Donald Trump has been caught in repeated lies since he learned to talk.  To him falsehoods are as natural as breathing.  Insults as natural as eating.  His ruminations remind me of the end result of eating.
doocurly,"Imagine defending yourself against the horrific charge of rape, and instead of saying, ""I wouldn't ever rape anyone"", you say, ""She's not my type"" over and over again. It implies that you would most certainly rape someone who was your 'type', and that's further bolstered by his 'grab 'em by the pussy' remarks. 

I know he's a sick and demented old man, but god, everytime I read something he's said or listen to his voice, I have a visceral reaction to him. He is a nauseating and unsettling human being."
markedasred,"The old saying in action, give him enough rope, and he will hang himself. Let him talk on record as much as he wants, then convict him on his own words."
GhettoChemist,"Remember when that Kelly Anne Conway called them ""alternative truths""? Fuck i do not miss 45's clown show admin"
kittenconfidential,the republic started by a man who could not tell a lie will be destroyed by men who cannot tell the truth.
Present_Structure_67,So he was talking.
WilHunting2,"For most of us, this is what we call “illegal”, but for Trump, it’s just another day without consequences."
NorthImpossible8906,"yeah yeah,  lies. Lots of lies. 

But what blows me away is that he can actually say ""I wouldn't rape her, she is not my type"" and hasn't been thrown into the dark flooded basement of Alcatraz (still abandoned) to rot for eternity is beyond me. 

""not my type"""
smurfsundermybed,"It's good that he was able to get some things off his chest about other investigations during the deposition.

Dad always told his clients to get out as much as possible during a deposition. Don't worry about staying focused. Just get it all off your chest. You have someone willing to listen to you, so take advantage of it. Anything that's bothering you, just get it all on the record. He wasn't very good at his job."
leeny1018,"I think there is a general psychological delusion in both the boomer generation and the one before it.  They have their stories, they like their stories, and they are sticking with them.  My grandpa (born in the 20s) swore up and down he was 100% Irish, and when I completed our genealogy, I discovered he was actually 50% Hungarian, but he refused this fact, despite the evidence on census documents and DNA tests… to this day he believes and tells everyone he is 100% Irish.  My dad (born in the 50s) is the same way, he makes up his own version of the past, it’s a very sunny and shiny version, and he is the hero of his own story, and any facts that counter that are totally ignored.  I think this contributes to these two generation’s resistance, and often strong feelings, about telling some hard truths about America and it’s history, they just prefer the story of America they know, and will deny any other information that provides a counter narrative.  I find it fascinating.  Especially because the generations after boomer tend to just let our parents and grandparents keep their fantasies.  It’s too hard to bring them face to face with the truths they don’t like to acknowledge."
RNDASCII,Honest question - does the count as perjury?

1000_pi10ts,"It's weird how people still pretend like this guy has anything of value to say, he is clearly insane. If they put him in front of any investigatory panel, he would end up in jail almost immediately."
Espinita_Boricua,"Gee, why am I not surprised?"
fairoaks2,I hope she hits his wallet hard!
kylew1985,Well Hunter Biden has unpaid late charges at Blockbuster Video.
Proper-Razzmatazz764,"""I didn't rape her but she said she liked being raped by me"" 

How many times does this guy have to openly confess to crimes before someone listens and does something about it?"
Thigh_Low_Scene,"Unfortunately this will quickly be removed like the article talking about Donald Trump admitting to rape

The people in charge here have decided that that is not politics, but all of the articles about hunter Biden's penis are."
bunkscudda,"If a woman accuses a man of rape, and his defense is “she’s not my type”… then yeah, he raped her."
DapperCam,Is he even capable of telling the truth? Does he even know what the truth is in his McDonalds-addled brain?
P0Rt1ng4Duty,Didn't he also refuse to submit his DNA for this case despite being court ordered to do so?
ThiccBoiCetrifier,I truly wonder what force of corruption has kept this man out of jail. I'd pay money for someone to do a deep dive on that.
Deeman0,To absolutely no one's surprise.
Acceptable_Wall4085,I don’t care if he goes to prison for tax evasion or pussy invasion. Just get him behind bars somewhere.
SquirrelDumplins,This is why every lawyer in every case or hearing against Trump have fought to true death to keep him from deposition or taking the stand. The dude just can’t not spew BS
Goldar85,"Why wouldn’t he lie? He never faces any consequences. I hate Donald Trump as much as the next guy, but Trump is smart here. He’d be a fool to tell the truth and get in trouble when blatant lies work."
TonhoStark,"As a brazilian, l’ve seen all major political events that happened in US to repeat here: extreme right at the presidency, failure to win a second term, invasion of Capitol/Congress and criminal charges being filed against the ex presidents. But I’m certain that Bolsonaro will face so much more problems in court than this orange clown.

Sadly, the american judiciary, and other democratic institucions, doesn’t work as well as ours."
IceLongjumping1866,"He lied so much, why would you be surprised? Never vote Red."
Wasabi_Noir,Lock this bloated scrotum up already. He deserves far worse than prison at this point.
Trick421,"Now wait just a darned minute. Are you telling me, that the former President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump, lied during a formal deposition, recorded in front of attorneys, stenographers, and sworn officers of the court... again? 

He would never do that, would he? Lie to the American People? Reap huge profits while president by overcharging the Federal Government for Secret Service staying at his properties? Lie to his base, and milk them for campaign contributions then keep all the money? Naw, he'd never do any of those things... would he?"
trouser-chowder,"Remember that this is a man who was so well known to his own lawyers for being a pathological liar that they would meet with him in pairs, because he couldn't be relied on to tell the truth even to his own attorneys."
dLimit1763,So he is being charged with perjury as would any other US citizen right?
Marginal_Eden,Orange can’t help but lie. Constantly lying and bullshitting.
Apprehensive-Ad5145,Dude has 23 plus rape cases people are dumb as fuck
Chef_RoadRunner,There is a word for that. Perjury. It is a crime. But unlike you and me he will not be held accountable.
Maleficent-Blood8070,Biden is sharp but Trump follow usrs aren't able to interpret what he or anyone who speaks like an educated adult says. Trump isn't  much younger than Biden and repeats himself constantly. His childish name calling and sixth grade verbal responses are the levels his followers can understand.
GraniteMtn,"...And his supporters DON'T CARE.  They'd rather have a lying, cheating, pedophile, misogynist without common family values, than a Democrat.

Trump could walk on stage an assert ""I AM the Anti-Christ you blind fools!"" and his followers - including Evangelicals - would submit to ""whelp, I guess we follow the Anti-Christ now..."""
isabps,I can’t believe I know people that still think he is a genius..
minedyermanners,Catching Trump in repeated isn't news. We already know he lies every time he opens his mouth.
TheEffinChamps,"This has been his dad's and whole family's MO for decades. Anyone that knows his family from the real estate game would not be surprised by any of this in the slightest.

I don't think he knows any other way to operate at this point."
MaleficentPi,"This is a standard thing for Trump. 

His attorneys something like ten years back refused, in court, on record, to have him testify because they said ""He will perjure himself"".

Nothing he says is true and he doesn't even blink at telling lies.

If he lived two hundred years ago he would have been in debtor's prison at minimum, and dead from at least one personal duel.

(And, you know, probably dead because no amount of sentient caterpillar alien hair can keep a human being alive for two hundred years, but hey)"
DamonFields,"Isn’t lying under oath a crime? For most of us, anyways."
Enough-Collection-98,That’s a funny way of saying perjury.
