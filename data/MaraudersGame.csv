Always bring your best. What I mean is bring a ton of ammo and just fucking shoot. Pre fire everything you feel is sus or know a player is behind. My friend noted I just mag dump and ""waste a lot of ammo."" Like dude most the ammo is cheap af and fuck it if I bring a bar I damn well am gonna shoot it before I die if I get the slightest suspicion someone is holding. I tried to convey the importance of suppressive fire (especially in squads) and fucking half the time the person just peaks mid lag and dies anyway lol. My pvp is average I think at 2.1. Not amazing but not bad. 

Yes I die a shit ton too.

Edit: promise by the 10th time youve lost that plate rig back to back you will stop caring about gear. It comes and goes so freely and once you don't care and start taking risks you'll get better.  Ratting can be profitable but sometime you just gotta stand your ground. It takes just one good shot to change your fortunes so shoot"

If I get into a firefight and we're both shooting each other down to half HP, I can hide around the corner to heal and my mate will jump in and finish the kill, it's really cool. I'm also less afraid of being loud when playing with a mate.  
On the other hand, sometimes when you see an enemy, you hesitate a little bit before you shoot because you're not sure if it's your mate or not. It all has its pros and cons."

Yesterday I took out 7 marauders in the mines. My advice is to use a healthy balance of slow-paced gameplay and aggression. Don’t be afraid to sprint across a room into a doorway because in this game the peeker has the advantage. You can startle players and have the advantage. At the same time, sometimes you wanna crouch walk and conceal your presence/position. I play solo for the most part and have a 1.88 marauder KD at about 40ish hours."

The Red Baron - Patch #01 (LIVE),"Space pirates, **Red Baron Patch #01** has just landed!

https://preview.redd.it/8acsw999x7ea1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c53d5080afeeb54f09c365578018ed2f9aa3ddd6

Thanks for your patience while we addressed the Market Trade bug that appeared over the new year. Your reports on this, along with reports on other bugs, have been instrumental in the completion of this Patch. Our main focus was to fix the Market Trader bug, fix the different crashes that players were experiencing, as well as address some inventory problems that were causing significant item loss, or ship loss. We’ve done extensive testing to ensure the fixes we have implemented will work, however there is always a chance for an issue to slip through the cracks. So if you find any of the above issues continuing to reoccur, please let us know in [Discord](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=discord.gg/marauders), using the **ModMail** feature from the top of the sidebar!

We also took the time to add as many more fixes as we could, including updates to the UI and Sound. Oh, and we had a look at everyone's favourite weapon type, the Shotgun. Changes below!

Known Issues:

* Localisation may be incorrect or missing, due to content changes. This will be adjusted and resolved throughout Early Access.

**PATCH CHANGE LIST:**

ART

* Tighter scratch damage on and improved normal map shading environmental objects.
* A large number of item icons are now from textures instead of snapshots of items in-game (e.g. melee weapons).
* Mosin Obrez now has an ironsight (front post).

BALANCING

* Terminator and Trench Gun have had their spread increased to be more inline with other shotguns, and to prevent shotgun sniping.
* Liberator damage increased from 15x8 to 16x8.
* Terminator shotgun damage decreased from 18x12 to 14x12.
* Terminator shotgun now has 15 durability (down from 25).
* Terminator shotgun has a 30% increase in value and repair cost.
* Normal speed (not boosting) of the pod is now 15% faster, and has a 12-second cooldown instead of 14 seconds between boosts.
* Small first aid kit now heals 7 health per second instead of 5.

AI

* Shotgun A.I. should no longer engage at long distances, but instead reposition or charge.

SOUND

* Tweaks made to gunshot sounds to help with spatialisation.
* Tweaks made to the Howitzer turret and Large turret to help with spatialisation.
* Cut dead space from the beginning of some gunshot sounds to make them more snappy.
* Upped the max concurrency limit on some weapon shooting sounds (like the Thompson) to stop the shooting getting cut off when firing full auto.
* Increased the volume of the pick up/put down Gold Bullion sounds.
* Increased the volume of footsteps on glass while walking.
* Increased the volume of crouching walking on glass..
* Fixed missing sounds when using Esc to go back through layers of exit menus in-game.

UI

* QOL on crew password check menu, you can now press enter to try the password without needing to press the try button.
* In the main menu, core contract missions that are time-based are now formatted more usefully as 00:00 instead of just an int. value.
* Added a UI blocker to stop crewmembers being able to set an active ship while in a crew and not the captain.

OPTIMISATIONS

* Optimised lighting in the main menu.
* Optimised skeletal meshes in the main menu.
* Optimised collision in the main menu.
* Optimised bullet shaders (used for ammo pickups).

* Fix added for Captain’s ships not coming into raid.
* Fixed bug which could cause the shop to stock items it shouldn't.
* Fixes added for vertical audio not working.
* Fixes added for a bug where crew members could get left behind when the crew goes into a match.
* Fixes added to the crew system to be more reliable.
* Fixes added to stop crewmembers losing an active ship when going in as part of a crew.
* Fixes for a rare chance to lose a ship when returning from a match due to an ID collision.

* Misc spelling/grammar fixes.
* Fixes to shotgun damage stats in the workbench not being correct.
* Bank notes pickup now has collision (doesn't drop through the floor).

* Fix added for player mask resetting to default values instead of being based on FOV.
* Fixed bug where melee weapons could do bullet impact sounds when they hit surfaces.

* Fixed short name of supply drops to be S.D instead of S.B
* Fixes to UI text cutoff in French language.
* Fixes for UI overlapping text in German language.

Thanks for your patience while we addressed the Market Trade bug that appeared over the new year. Your reports on this, along with reports on other bugs, have been instrumental in the completion of this Patch. Our main focus was to fix the Market Trader bug, fix the different crashes that players were experiencing, as well as address some inventory problems that were causing significant item loss, or ship loss. We’ve done extensive testing to ensure the fixes we have implemented will work, however there is always a chance for an issue to slip through the cracks. So if you find any of the above issues continuing to reoccur, please let us know in [Discord](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=discord.gg/marauders), using the **ModMail** feature from the top of the sidebar!

We also took the time to add as many more fixes as we could, including updates to the UI and Sound. Oh, and we had a look at everyone's favourite weapon type, the Shotgun. Changes below!

Known Issues:

* Localisation may be incorrect or missing, due to content changes. This will be adjusted and resolved throughout Early Access.

We’ve done extensive testing to ensure the fixes we have implemented will work, however there is always a chance for an issue to slip through the cracks. So if you find any of the above issues continuing to reoccur, please let us know in [Discord](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=discord.gg/marauders), using the **ModMail** feature from the top of the sidebar!

We also took the time to add as many more fixes as we could, including updates to the UI and Sound. Oh, and we had a look at everyone's favourite weapon type, the Shotgun. Changes below!

Thanks for your patience while we addressed the Market Trade bug that appeared over the new year. Your reports on this, along with reports on other bugs, have been instrumental in the completion of this Patch. Our main focus was to fix the Market Trader bug, fix the different crashes that players were experiencing, as well as address some inventory problems that were causing significant item loss, or ship loss. We’ve done extensive testing to ensure the fixes we have implemented will work, however there is always a chance for an issue to slip through the cracks. So if you find any of the above issues continuing to reoccur, please let us know in [Discord](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=discord.gg/marauders), using the **ModMail** feature from the top of the sidebar!

We also took the time to add as many more fixes as we could, including updates to the UI and Sound. Oh, and we had a look at everyone's favourite weapon type, the Shotgun. Changes below!

Known Issues:

* Localisation may be incorrect or missing, due to content changes. This will be adjusted and resolved throughout Early Access.

**PATCH CHANGE LIST:**

ART

* Tighter scratch damage on and improved normal map shading environmental objects.
* A large number of item icons are now from textures instead of snapshots of items in-game (e.g. melee weapons).
* Mosin Obrez now has an ironsight (front post).

BALANCING

* Terminator and Trench Gun have had their spread increased to be more inline with other shotguns, and to prevent shotgun sniping.
* Liberator damage increased from 15x8 to 16x8.

* Terminator shotgun now has 15 durability (down from 25).
* Terminator shotgun has a 30% increase in value and repair cost.
* Normal speed (not boosting) of the pod is now 15% faster, and has a 12-second cooldown instead of 14 seconds between boosts.
* Small first aid kit now heals 7 health per second instead of 5.

AI

* Shotgun A.I. should no longer engage at long distances, but instead reposition or charge.

SOUND

* Tweaks made to gunshot sounds to help with spatialisation.
* Tweaks made to the Howitzer turret and Large turret to help with spatialisation.
* Cut dead space from the beginning of some gunshot sounds to make them more snappy.
* Upped the max concurrency limit on some weapon shooting sounds (like the Thompson) to stop the shooting getting cut off when firing full auto.
* Increased the volume of the pick up/put down Gold Bullion sounds.
* Increased the volume of footsteps on glass while walking.
* Increased the volume of crouching walking on glass..

We’ve done extensive testing to ensure the fixes we have implemented will work, however there is always a chance for an issue to slip through the cracks. So if you find any of the above issues continuing to reoccur, please let us know in [Discord](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=discord.gg/marauders), using the **ModMail** feature from the top of the sidebar!

We also took the time to add as many more fixes as we could, including updates to the UI and Sound. Oh, and we had a look at everyone's favourite weapon type, the Shotgun. Changes below!

We need progression badly,,10xv9ry,97,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/10xv9ry/we_need_progression_badly/,RoyalSir,"I’m just starved for more content. I’ve got 100 hours in and am bored. That being said, the core of this game is amazing, it just needs *more*."
We need progression badly,,10xv9ry,97,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/10xv9ry/we_need_progression_badly/,kaimidoyouloveme,"I agree. So much of the game is really excellent - really fast matchmaking/load times, seamless multi-instance raids with the different ships and POIs, really cool aesthetics and artwork, solid AI enemies. When its working as intended, it’s pretty incredible. 

But it’s not going to hold people until there’s a substantial, lasting reason to play other than just enjoying it, whether that be progression to facilitate gameplay (like Tarkov, with leveling up to unlock trader items) or cosmetics (like The Cycle, Hunt, Sea of Thieves, etc). Zero to Hero needs a lot more tweaking, either progress is so slow that it isn’t worth pursuing with prestiges or grinding it encourages a lot of non engaging gameplay to find your objectives. Neither is really helping to elevate the gaming experience right now. 

I think the big questions for the devs at this point are: 
1. How do we make prestige levels meaningful and rewarding?
2. How do we establish satisfying goals within each prestige grind?
3. Are we adding a combination of micro-transactions and/or grind for cosmetics (a la Hunt or SoT)?

Surely the devs are already well into coming up with answers to these questions, but it’s a tricky balance for any game, let alone an early access game from a small team. 

I agree that a top priority should be finding a way to represent and reward prestige levels throughout the early access phase. Folks that pre-ordered and did the alpha/beta have a well deserved cosmetic set, but in a lot of ways the early access play testers and potential long term players are even more important/significant because they’re helping find the long term balance for the game. Having absolutely no mechanism to track/reward the progress in between EA wipes has seriously discouraged people from doing more than a handful of raids. It would be helpful if higher prestige levels came with cosmetic unlocks that carry over through wipes, or even just the first level. But doing full wipes with no recognition of previous efforts stings people and will discourage them from investing their time in the game, potentially turning them off for good.

Could also be fun to have some statistical tracking for each prestige level, so you could track how many raids it took you for each prestige, how far you got in various things, how you’re improving over each level, etc. sort of like how The Cycle tracks each season.

As far as other goals within gameplay, having an “elite” map might be useful, something that requires an unlock or a key (like Labs in Tarkov) or a non-Rustbucket ship. Preferably one single very large raid location, like Death Star sized. It would give more purpose to higher tier gear and could help with some late game intrigue, but probably tough to balance with the player base as it is because right now it would be a bunch of empty raids. At least it would add some consistency to a raid choice, one of the things that makes Hunt or Tarkov compelling is there’s a decent amount of predictability in how each round/raid is set up. 

I think the devs are perfectly comfortable with a low player count right now since they’re still building out the game, but eventually if there isn’t more to keep people invested during early access, it’s going to hurt their growth prospects long-term. Some of these changes shouldn’t be that hard to make and should go a long way towards keeping people happy and engaged with the game throughout its development. Looking forward to seeing what the devs come up with!"

We need progression badly,,10xv9ry,97,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/10xv9ry/we_need_progression_badly/,Maxfightmaster1993,"Honestly, I love the current state of things outside of the polish that needs to happen regarding animations/weapon models/etc. 

I do agree that there could stand to be some more progression and a slightly more defined ""endgame"" but honestly the availability of good loot by hunting AI/other players is one of the best parts of this game compared to Tarkov. I can sherpa friends through their first couple of games and get them in full Panzer/Heavy Stahlhelm with a Barrel Backpack and good kit in like, 2 raids. From there we can focus on Z2H and have a great time grinding the main quest and trader missions. 

I've been playing more and more as I've reached the point where I've figured out the rhythm of this game and my K/D has been climbing with every raid, I queued as a solo last night and killed 3 duos in the first 5 minutes on spaceport. 

One thing that I know would make raids more interesting would be the addition of a common mission objective for all players, just like we all get tasks if everyone in the raid got a shared task with a large reward that would entice (if not force) more player conflict and a more defined win condition for players beyond ""Wipe the lobby, get good loot, simple as""."

Since they made in raid contracts it seems more tedious and redundant.  don't have enough in raid contracts.

Also this isn’t “coping” it’s simply the truth, if you think otherwise you’re uneducated about the industry and should probs do more research.

Devs, if you see this comment I love Marauders, it has gotten me into extraction shooters, and has helped me get more accustomed with pc controls, as this was one of the first games I played on PC.

Maybe as a rare supply drop item. Or special hot shotty ammo type and a reinforced metal barrel. If you didn't have the reinforced barrel the gun would just explode randomly in the first 5 shots lol l. 

The terminator maybe needed a materials nerf. The gun put you at an extreme disadvantage, I'd constantly have to switch to my sidearm to clean things up (which is tough when you have to rack a round every time the character pulls out a weapon). It's really a shame. It's not like it was the AWP in CSS or something. It required accuracy and calm. If you had full hp and decent armor 1 shot wouldn't kill unless it was a direct headshot close up. 

This is just a huge bummer. I loved this game cause all my friends who were mediocre at shooters (my genre) would actually play it with me cause there's limited to no sniping. They can handle close quarters, and I'm a wizard with a shotgun... So this was just the perfect mix for me... It's gonna be hard booting up now. I was stoked we found a game where I can shotgun and my friends can spray and pray. 

I'll have to go back to insurgency for my shotty fix :(

There's no reason for a shotgun pattern to be this garbage so close. With a modified choke you can accurately land a 1ft buckshot pattern around 50 yards.

Nerf the terminator, leave the trench gun alone! Lol

I'm sure there's a bunch of people who are super stoked these guns are obsolete."

Honestly I've found more success running and gunning recently than sticking around corners.

Try being more aggressive in gunfights. Slow peaking around corners (especially left hand peaks) against enemies that know you're there will always get you killed. Set your engagements so you are right hand peaking from good cover. If you have to fall back into a more advantageous position, make sure you don't put yourself in a corner. Always leave room to reposition. Cover and concealment are important in this game as well. A lot of stuff is wall bangable so know what you're standing behind. 

Good luck out there, marauder"

I'm down for giving the systems more depth, adding new content, but marauders is so much simpler than some other extraction shooters.  The maps are easy to memorize, with the small corridor design on most maps making it very easy to orient yourself.  Crafting is just complex enough to motivate me to engage with it, and gives you decent milestones to know what kind of gear you're expected to be bringing based on your level.  Gear is easy to understand, guns deal x damage and armor reduces damage by y, if I see higher level gear I can just glance at it and know it's good.  Loot spawns are consistent, easy to identify, and are in spots which make sense.

I got burned out on tarkov after maybe 10 hours of trying, but I felt like I needed to study spreadsheets to really know what was going on.  With marauders it's way easier to just hop on, have a decent time, and stop playing whenever."

It's like a combination of Tarkov and an mmo named Star Citizen with a World War setting. But WAY LESS complicated than those games, but it's not a walk in the park either. Even the A.I. can be confused with a player of how they behave to noise, they can duck or even lean. And the combat it's not just rushing and shooting. Even if your enemy has a pistol, it's not a clear who might end up winning. 

I always enjoy games that take the ww times and add something to it or at least a setting similar to the 1940s. Like waw zombies or Resistance Fall of Man or Wolfenstein the New Order (specially the first level)

I would love if they could add a physical place that you can upgrade and you can view your ships like Tarkov has it's hideout, Cycle: the frontier has the room or Vigor has you settlement. I place that you can care about and craft more than just things you can lose (like weapons, armor or ships).

This game has bugs yeah, sometimes I feel stressed but I never felt the anger and fury I felt playing Tarkov while playing Marauders.

Sure, Tarkov has more depth. Sure, they are both different games. No one is debating that. I'd have to agree that, at the moment, I'm enjoying Marauders a great deal more. 

Over the last couple of wipes there have been a lot of small things that when added together, just make Tarkov less enjoyable for me. Marauders is in a great spot imo."

Not being sarcastic. I liked marauders for about a month or so while the end of tarkovs last wipe was going on also.

My problem is with you coming to another games Reddit to what, validate yourself? You played tarkov for less than a year. None of the things you mentioned should ruin the game for you. 

The new map is glitchy? It just came out, it's not optimized yet. Lighthouse was the same way. It will get there, the game is still in 'beta'. They aren't releasing finished products, they are testing and tweaking. You also don't have to play it?

 Audio is kinda bad, but not game breaking, and marauders audio is not much better even without the complexity of surfaces or covert movements.

Hackers are not a large scale problem in Tarkov. It's a reddit problem where people think people are hacking all the time and amplify nothing. I've come across maybe 2 times I'm almost sure of a hacker in over 4 wipes and thousands of hours. First day playing marauders? I saw a unarmed prisoner looking guy run super fast at me, threw some wires on the ground and then sunk into the floor. It's all anecdotal.

You're not getting banned from killing streamers. 1 person that happened to? They aren't abusing their power, they aren't breaking the game with updates... They are making changes that the community asks for and then complains about when they change them. The Tarkov Reddit is almost strictly complaints and hackusations. It's toxic af and doesn't reflect the actual state of the game, and shouldn't affect how you vote the game.

I like team17 also, but this game is so so so bare bones compared to tarkov and will not take off like we would hope it would. This genre is too niche and tarkov is too good to be overtaken.

If you like the faster pace gameplay with little to no stakes, on a game whose genre depends on the thrill of the fight and therefore the loot, good on you, but it is not better than tarkov by a long shot."

Resolving the breaching debate: a suggestion.,"Add locked doors to the cockpit areas of all ships other than rustbucket in order to partition the cockpit off from the rest of ship.  Under normal circumstances, these doors require the pilot's keycard to open but can be disabled in two separate ways:

1. Locks are disabled when the ship is disabled
2. Locks can be disabled with a blowtorch like vault doors

This greatly rewards players for using a better ship and makes winning space combat meaningful in a way that I think is logical (disable the ship to access the otherwise hardened areas).  At the same time, it still allows players to breach a functional ship for pvp and plunder ( the stash might be used in raid if more people were in ships that had them, raiding it and getting out might become a strategy) however a blowtorch is required to actually break into the cockpit if the ship is not disabled.  I hope both sides of this debate will think through the various implications of this potential change and add their thoughts.

&#x200B;

edit:  Another way to implement this would be to simply tie the door's locked status to the status of the engines and allow blowtorches to damage engines inside the ship, but I think it's more dramatic to torch open the door and face a hail of gunfire.

Reckon it's a good money sink and encourages using the larger ships so you can fit additional crew. Could even have different value tiers for them and hiring a more expensive crew member would result in a better armed/more effective deterrent. And same way with ships, you keep them until they die, or maybe until their contract runs out (maybe like 10 raids or something).

I like the bulkhead/locked door idea as well though, maybe some combination would be worthwhile?"

At the same time, it still allows players to breach a functional ship for pvp and plunder ( the stash might be used in raid if more people were in ships that had them, raiding it and getting out might become a strategy) however a blowtorch is required to actually break into the cockpit if the ship is not disabled.  I hope both sides of this debate will think through the various implications of this potential change and add their thoughts.

",10beevb,67,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/10beevb/resolving_the_breaching_debate_a_suggestion/,OverlordZombwich,"This doesn't really work because the vast majority of players use the Rustbucket. 

The idea is good, but it would need to apply to all ships. The biggest issue is poor new player experience and player retention. The issues causing this are tied to breaching and lack of balance along various aspects of the game. This is including but not limited to shotguns, pod usage, ship disabling and Headshot multiplier.

The easiest and safest fix would be ships within proximity to disabled ships can use pods. If this is implemented using locks then cool. If it's something else that's fine too but it needs to happen for the game to appeal to a broader audience.

The main thing is not giving long term players a big advantage over new players. Otherwise with how easy it is to get to ""endgame"" this game would need to wipe every 2-3 months."
Resolving the breaching debate: a suggestion.,"Add locked doors to the cockpit areas of all ships other than rustbucket in order to partition the cockpit off from the rest of ship.

If you disable a ship and get boarded by 4 people who can’t open the cockpit door, you have to leave at some point if you are ever going to enter a raid. Either way, it still ends in you being breached and a fight happening in someones ship, which was the main reason for suggesting the initial breach change.

Cool idea, but I don’t think it necessarily tackles the main issue people have with breaching. Being that it doesn’t reward the winner with anything because they’ll just get breached and have to fight inside anyways."

Feature request: Allow rigs to be stored in containers/bags,"As of now, it's a huge pain to have multiple chest armour pieces that have storage, e.g. Plate Rigs or Leather Jerkins. They are the only item than can't be put inside bags or containers, since bags can at least be folded and stored. This means that not only do you have to have space set aside in your stash specifically for a rig if you want to craft one, but you can also never bring more than one rig out of a raid. So unless you go into a raid with storage-less armour and drop it for a rig, you'll never be able to keep any in backup. Came in with a plate rig and found a Panzer Rig? Tough luck, can only keep one of them, that Radio Backpack ain't helping you.

Even if they could be placed in other containers, they couldn't be abused for space, since no rigs can fit inside themselves. Technically a Leather Jerkin could fit inside a BA Flak Vest, but only once, and that could be prevented by a ""no rigs inside of rigs"" rule if need be. Or, if they allowed rigs to be ""folded"" or ""flattened"" to fit inside of a bag, that would be fine as well. A Panzer Rig already takes up a 4x5 of space, so it's not like it would be easy to carry out of a raid.

Feature request: Allow rigs to be stored in containers/bags,"As of now, it's a huge pain to have multiple chest armour pieces that have storage, e.g. Plate Rigs or Leather Jerkins. They are the only item than can't be put inside bags or containers, since bags can at least be folded and stored. This means that not only do you have to have space set aside in your stash specifically for a rig if you want to craft one, but you can also never bring more than one rig out of a raid. So unless you go into a raid with storage-less armour and drop it for a rig, you'll never be able to keep any in backup. Came in with a plate rig and found a Panzer Rig? Tough luck, can only keep one of them, that Radio Backpack ain't helping you.

Even if they could be placed in other containers, they couldn't be abused for space, since no rigs can fit inside themselves. Technically a Leather Jerkin could fit inside a BA Flak Vest, but only once, and that could be prevented by a ""no rigs inside of rigs"" rule if need be. Or, if they allowed rigs to be ""folded"" or ""flattened"" to fit inside of a bag, that would be fine as well.

to the gentleman who jolly cooperationed with me at the mine vault,"To my mysterious Shieldwielding Companion,

We met while you were inside the vault with the door locked, you asked me not to shoot, I told you fuck you. You persisted with negotiations and when you opened up that vault, you opened up this marauders cold cold heart also. We crouch danced in the cold halogen bulb light, dunked on some raiders, and split the depot loot with the token you had brought with you.

We never exchanged captains cards, and perhaps that was for the best, I wonder where you are now my moon man friend, as I think on my last memory of you blazing across the darkness of space in your escape pod. Our paths never to cross again like Rustbuckets in the night.

They say space is a dangerous place and we all know the risks. But I now know the greatest loot of all comes from risking it all trusting in a gasmasked man behind a gigantic steel door.

It is very time consuming to run back to stash loot in the ship. And crates mostly give money and a couple good guns. I usually only take the KA or Small Supply Drops for the L1A1 rifle and attachments. 

I personally prefer to just hunt players for guns/armor/meds, which are the only items I value and desire in this game. Everything else is a dime-a-dozen and so plentiful that gathering it is never an issue.

But ships do have advantages in groups and for rat-type players. Although it does mean more risk, more reward, which is sometimes contrary to how rats want to play.

Overall, the advantages don't align with the majority of people's aspirations in Marauders. Hopefully Devs correct that in future updates"

I get that it is ""meta"" for getting marauder kills but sitting in pods in open space is a playstyle that should be discouraged as it makes no sense that leaving your ship makes you faster and far more imposing. The pod takes 2 shots worth of damage and is as fast as an interceptor when boosted if not faster which makes no sense when you look at the speed stats. All of this aside the space combat just feels absolutely garbage as a solo player because any ship other than the Rustbucket cannot used efficiently currently as the turret only ever points forward de-centivizing counterplay to pods as the risk is far to high for the payout and generally ends in the player losing their ship to many teams who are excited to see anything but a Rustbucket on the map. Call me crazy here folks but the lack of risk in piloting the Rustbucket and legit losing it every game feels very out of place for a hardcore shooter -- players should be incentivized to not scuttle a ship every game."

Why try and level up the faction shops? You’ll never struggle for loot in this game. And it’s so slow going the incentive isn’t worth it. The main quest line is is poorly balanced, it goes from an easy task to VERY hard one back to easy again. Expanding into other ships still isn’t worth it, better to just sell them for $22k and move on you can fly to the destination in like 30seconds and work on getting to the real meat of the game.

It has a bright future. Personally for me I got bored after about 50 hours I haven't played since. The most recent updates haven't been enough for me to load the game up. 

My personal gripes. Maps play way too similar, some maps if it wasn't for the outside I couldn't have told you it was a different map. There isn't enough to do or grind for at the moment. Combat is pretty fun but not ""oh sht I can't believe I clutched that"" type of feeling. 

I love the overall direction. Just not enough for me to go back to yet."

There’s not as many cheaters as you’d think,"Some of you guys are just newer. It’s ok, you just don’t realize that the skill gap is higher than you know.

I’m top 250, have probably 200+ hours and have learned a thing or two. 

Yesterday I got a 7 kill then 5 kill game back to back. After both I realized I probably got reported by at least one person. 

But, what happened was I realized the players weren’t the greatest, and I knew where they’d go, what angles they are likely holding, and usually knew what gun they had. I then used that info along with audio, to kill them quite efficiently. 

Good players recognize bad players, and then do what good players do to bad players. Eventually it feels easy, factoring gunplay improves with time just as much as game sense. 

Just because a guy “knows exactly where you’re at” doesn’t mean he’s walling. But rather that’s he’s probably just better 🤷‍♂️

In a game with TTK so low it's really easy to not be able to figure out how someone killed you. Sometimes they've pinpointed your location because you aimed down sight too early, or crouched, or maybe they heard you tromping around before you even knew they existed."

Also something that makes people think there is a lot of cheating is the desync. Recently one of the my friends I’ve known since two wipes ago accused me of hacking because of desync. Luckily he was streaming and so was I so he looked back at my vod and apologized and realized that there are even fewer cheaters than he and we thought. Hit reg and desync is real in this game.

But, what happened was I realized the players weren’t the greatest, and I knew where they’d go, what angles they are likely holding, and usually knew what gun they had. I then used that info along with audio, to kill them quite efficiently. 

Good players recognize bad players, and then do what good players do to bad players. Eventually it feels easy, factoring gunplay improves with time just as much as game sense. 

Just because a guy “knows exactly where you’re at” doesn’t mean he’s walling. But rather that’s he’s probably just better 🤷‍♂️


It’s discouraging to see all the cheating allegations when in reality most of the time it’s bad players learning the hard way.

You can try running potato settings, but your time is limited for modern FPS with your current rig.

If you're running into this issue with marauders, it's definitely time for an upgrade.  
This game isn't demanding for modern specs by any means, even my old rx580 8gb crushed it. Cant use my old Alienware Alpha r1 for it as 2gb of Vram just doesn't work with anything beyond indie sidescrollers in the year of our lort 2023(2).  

Unfortunately that means either a tower (full build that you can update later) or a laptop (that should last 5-ish years). Desktop will be cheaper in the long run but is more intensive to set up in terms of cost and time.

While I think it would be cool if we could message players later or something like that, I don't know if I would play Marauders if I has to listen to some squeaker calling me a name etc.

It would, however, be neat if there was more non-combat ways to interact, perhaps.  Maybe when we get more mods for ships, they will create a neutral raid zone or something Ala Rust, where we can voice chat etc"

There will always be someone better or more geared out than you, and they will get the better of you most of the time.

Are there hackers in this game? Of course but they are extremely far and few between.  Most of the time it’s someone with very good map knowledge, aim and awareness.

I think the beauty of this game is that even though 80% of the time you’ll die to some chad, that 20% that you get the upper hand and take their stacked kit out of the raid the dopamine high is intoxicating.

Also the small maps and high headshot multiplier means you always have a chance against the chads even with rat gear, you just need to get gud."

The thing about including something like proximity chat is, it's 100% optional. For some reason, I doubt the inclusion of proximity chat would make this game any less sweaty. 

I always see posts on this subreddit addressed to various anonymous players: ""*To the marauder who \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ at the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I can't believe \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ happened""*

Or this one about Jeff for instance:

People clearly want to connect, they should have a way to do so. Global voice is the obvious solution. 

And hey, who's to say you couldn't've breached Jeff and Demonic Mango, voice chat disabled, and took their pistol totin' asses out with the L1A1?

I think Marauders can make room for both kinds of players to do their thing. Folks like yourself who wanna click heads no funny business, and then guys who wanna clown around like in the video you see above."

They're not gonna get good gear, they'd be better camping an airlock on the way back, or the vault or something. 

They're not gonna get marauder kills, or if they do they'll get maybe one, at the cost of having to pray they get an airlock that opens, within a decent time, and even then they'd be far better off just jumping in an interceptor with rocket artillery. 

I really don't think people are camping airlocks all that often, I think they just sprint towards the sound of them opening (I know I do)."

I unintentionally have done this to people, twice in the same round actually. I was already in the raid for 5 minutes when someone docked into arrivals and I was standing around the corner so yea I popped him as the door opened, and then when I was in the kitchen the same thing happened, I also didn't give that guy a chance.


But to call it camping if I've had enough time to maneuver around and hear your airlock opening and run to it to engage to protect myself I think is unfair. I also don't think people are sprinting to airlocks and waiting, in the initial burst of ships getting the raids you have 1-3 crews docking at once and have no idea of that's a 1-4 man crew, you then also have to correctly guess which airlock they'll and then try to camp the airlock in a position that gives you the best chance of killing everyone in that airlock and not getting killed by them or a roaming npc or crew, all before they open the airlock too

You have a chance to do it now with the two raid locations and other crews flying further but even then you have to contend with established crews in raid, finding an airlock that's empty and just waiting for a crew that may or may not show up 

It's an intentional mechanic if the airlocks make that much noise, the panel let's you know it's in use and the devs added cover in the locks

You can also get ""camped"" by SAS ai on Outpost too

As soon as you enter your ships side of the airlock it's game on

I more often run into docking and simultaneously opening the airlock next to another crew on spaceport, mine, or terra

I think it's more likely this guy was looting or already doing something heard you and just didn't want you to get the drop on him"

Small chance it was a player ship, but I’m pretty sure your death screen would have had their name in it if so. Avoid by going back to your airlock, or sweeping the outside of the raid location and making sure there aren’t any turrets left before you enter. If the Red Baron is around you might just be out of luck, he’s harder to find than stationary turrets."

He can take you out almost instantly when you exit because I'm pretty sure he can track players without line of sight. It's happened to me multiple times when there's either few players on the server or when you leave late after everyone is already dead/gone. If you play solo with a rust bucket I'd highly suggest just leaving as soon as you see him even if you just started the raid. I've had great raids with good loot and all three missions completed ruined from getting instantly blasted after undocking. Your ship can get hit during the periscope animation and can already be disabled by the time you get the piloting view. It's something else the devs need to fix.

The rocket Turret, along with most other NPC's will fire at the position that you're currently in. Flying straight increases your chances of getting hit.  


Wiggle like your life depends on it. Become the worm. That way you won't get hit."

I find it's much easier as a solo when I play outside typical peak hours. I did 2 raids this morning and Both were solid successes with marauder kills. I still do well in those peak hours but I have to be more conservative since there's more likely to be teams as opposed to other solos.

Another thing I recommend at your level is to straight up bring nothing, run the luger kit and focus on killing AI and looting their gear. Avoid confrontation with marauders for the foreseeable future and focus on rebuilding your economy.

Have you fixed your settings? The default ones are trash honestly, I immediately got rid of motion blur, swithced the graphics options to medium across the board, and lowered the default sensitivity.

Before the wipe I had put myself in a no money scenario because I didn't pay attention to how much money I was spending on crafting recipes, I was down to about 5k, by the time of the wipe I was up to 1.5 Million with a stash full of compact and large containers."
