thecoocooman,"My congressman has already called for him to step down. Not for flashing this sign, but because we don‚Äôt even know who he really is. He‚Äôs about to get security clearance and shit and we literally don‚Äôt know his actual background and identity. I suggest more people pressure their reps to speak up about this.

AnohtosAmerikanos,It‚Äôs as though he‚Äôs just joined a gang of hoodlums and he wants to show them how daring he is at pulling dangerous pranks. He‚Äôs going to fit right in.
YellowBabylonianSub,"Well we should definitely take Santos at his word, it‚Äôs not like he has a well documented history of being a lying piece of shit and racist remarks."
Knoblord_McCheese,"Hey, have some respect everyone, George Santos fought at the Alamo. He was also the first man to walk on the moon. And he invented peanut butter. What's one little hand gesture when weighed against so many contributions to society?"
Leraldoe,Accused? You meant to say posed and photographed
HardcoreKaraoke,">The hand gesture was popularized by right-wing trolls on 4chan as a hoax hate symbol but was later adopted by white supremacists as a genuine expression of white supremacy, according to the Anti-Defamation League.

It's amazing how almost all of the QAnon MAGA stuff can be traced back to trolling online that idiots took way too fucking seriously. The Pizza Gate thing is the biggest one but a lot of their culture seems so ridiculous because it was started by someone fucking around online."
Knoblord_McCheese,"He wasn't ""accused"" of anything. He did it and we all saw it."
SamuelCish,Fuck the white nationalists for taking the OK symbol. And fuck all of us for just letting them have it.
flamethrowerfire9,He is trying to fit in with the rest of the republicans. His fraud is creatively justified and decorated to be virtuously presented.
gschwartz17,Santos may wanna invest in 23 and me.
Nah_Fam_Oh_Dam,"Give the man a break, he lost his mother in 9/11 and this past December."
M00n,"Watch the video and decide for yourself. 

https://twitter.com/Politically_Int/status/1611907741580419075"
giga_phantom,What a buffoon. The new cawthorn.
Busman123,"Where did that money come from, George? If you donated it to your own campaign, why isn't it listed as income on your personal tax return?

Hey, maybe you can help defund the IRS so they won't investigate."
goomyman,Accused?   He did it.
c53x12,How is this POS in position to make laws that the rest of us have to follow?  This country is so broken.
,[deleted]
hopopo,Fanny how he pretends to be Jewish AND White Nationalist in order to appeal to the same voters.
theBizz1138,Looks like he‚Äôs just a weird awkward guy and pulled a bit of a rocky bobby
808-isle-gal,"The dude does know he‚Äôs NOT white, right?"
PWal501,New kid trying to fit in with the rest of the GOP‚Ä¶
Albertsongman,He‚Äôs Jew-ish and flashing white sup signal? ‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs covering multiple bases like McCarthy.
joeO44,"I highly doubt he would flash a white supremacist symbol when he was an actual slave and freed thousands of them in the Underground Railroad. 

Source: George Santos"
tinacat933,Seriously- what‚Äôs the deal with his face? It makes me so uncomfortable
JohnnyGFX,"So that‚Äôs Republican ‚Äòvirtue signaling‚Äô, right?"
TintedApostle,He di flash it.  Its not a natural way to hold you hand.  You have to want to do it.
ssgonzalez11,Accused of or did it live for the world to see?
ShitHouseMcTits,This House is off to a great start.
SockGnome,"He is such a *weird* fucking person. If our House of Representatives is a reflection of the districts they come from, this country is closer to the end than we thought possible."
SuperGenius98K,Carlos Bigsby
Zoshchenko,But I thought he was Jew-ish?!?!
Spartanfred104,This guy does know his last name is Santos right?
onajourney314,What will it take to remove this buffoon from office?
I_make_things,"This guy is a shit tornado.

He fits right in with the rest of his party."
Confused_Emus,"Interesting gesture from someone with a name like Santos. If the Good Ol‚Äô Boys take over, they‚Äôll drag his ass behind a Ford pickup right next to my gay ass."
fb1499,"Yes, Republicans... have the immigrant junior senator flash a white power sign so we forget that the January6 insurrection happened and we don‚Äôt talk about it."
JefferSonD808,‚ÄúAccused‚Äù? There‚Äôs a fucking picture of him doing it. This isn‚Äôt an accusation or an allegation. He fucking did it.
pinkpenguin87,How is this even a question? There‚Äôs no accidentally putting your fingers in that shape.. he is such an amalgamation of the current Republican Party.
tortoisefur,Accused? They have photo evidence.
penguins_are_mean,"I‚Äôm sorry but fuck that. White supremacists don‚Äôt get to steal the OK hand gesture because some idiots on 4chan decided to troll the world.

Fucking stupid. I will continue to do it."
SeveralAct5829,There is something seriously wrong with that lying moron whatever his name really is
orbitalaction,"No, he straight up flashed it. We got photos, there is no reasonable doubt."
kartuli78,It was white power-ish.
fencerman,"""Accused of""? 

He did it on fucking camera. There are pictures. 

""George Santos DID flash white power symbol"" is the correct headline. 

Reporters need to grow a fucking spine."
Brock_Way,"He also blinked ""Hitler did nothing wrong"" in morse code."
nettiemaria7,"At the rate he is going, I would not be surprised to hear he was involuntarily committed at the ""psych ward"".   The behavior and his speech pattern seems akin to unmedicated bipolar w some adjunct diagnoses mixed in.  Full blown manic episode."
Reaperider,How did this become a white power symbol? I remember playing football in high school anytime anybody did that and you looked at it means he got to punch you.
whatsgoodforme,This guy is a pathological liar and a likely psycho. Just my opinion but it‚Äôs based on what we know of him so far.
cheap90scigar,Also the symbol for rolling and flicking boogers.
Viet_Conga_Line,C‚Äômon guys. Ask yourself. How could he be into white power when he‚Äôs clearly Black Hispanic Hebrew Israelite vegan kangaroo training lesbian?
Girthw0rm,"Guys, he‚Äôs not a racist, he‚Äôs a race-ist‚Ä¶ meaning he‚Äôs a fan of competitions to see who is the fastest."
rncd89,"I hate that the OK symbol is a white supremacist thing I still  use it all the time and don't really think about it but there have been a few times where I've been like ""Wait No!"""
Gingevere,"When you try to be sneaky about a dog whistle (holding theüëå down by his side) you only prove you know exactly what it is and exactly what you mean by it.

It's like someone looking both ways then whispering the word ""urban""."
Vomitbelch,"I refuse to accept that the OK symbol is a white supremacist symbol. I won't let 'em take that away from me... That being said, this guy is a piece of shit and should be booted from office. Can't believe our govt is so weak as to allow bold-faced liars like this to hold office. All of em, both sides, idc, if you're just lying nonstop there should be consequences... But apparently not! Just keep making that money and trashing the rest of us I guess."
Dont_Be_Sheep,Can someone remind me when/how this turned from the ‚Äúhah! Made you look!‚Äù Game ALL OF US played in middle/high school‚Ä¶ into a white power symbol? Like‚Ä¶ what caused this symbol to completely change meanings?
Plxburgh,If I was in the far right and this nerd was my far right rep I think I would have to reconsider everything.
ArmlessGeodude,Every single Republican.
newgreyarea,This is shocking! Jk. Totally on brand for modern Republicans.
crowe1130,Remember when a political party would see things like this clown has done as a liability and throw the person out?  Remember when people felt personal shame when caught being a lying shitbag?
RichardBreecher,"He has to be the leading GOP candidate for President now, right?
What else does he have to do to convince the base?"
everythingisopposite,"Republicans, just when you think they‚Äôve hit bottom, they grab a shovel."
