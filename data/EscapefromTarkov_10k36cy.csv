Brawl_Stars_Fan123,What actually is the game that you get if you buy eft on steam?
No_Torius-P-A-T,Hackers are so bad in this game that they've broken the 4th wall
crpiecho,"-Buys it on steam 
—trader photos are just Nakita meme gifs"
Cain-x,"The shitshow continues.

I'm out of popcorn please go slower."
CaptG33ch,Buy it on steam and save yourself from playing tarkov
w3irdz,Imagine the steam review... it will never happened
Hilloo-,How did this even get through? Don't Steam check anything?
casey28xxx,"I’m extremely surprised it’s this easy to make a fake store page for a game you didn’t create. You’d think there’d be a lot of legal stuff to get through before you can do so. Especially a game that is so well known.

I guess Steam is just as bad as Amazon or Apple, they don’t care who sells on their platform until enough folks (or the genuine creator) complain enough."
vitalkanev,The fake listing has been removed about 20 minutes ago (as of posting this comment).
Ololoec,How does Steam even allows it?
Mantrum,"**Confirmed by BSG** as a scam listing, or confirmed as **a scam listing by BSG**?

We're kinda the point where you have to ask."
Lezalit0,what even
shiftyslayer22,"Look at that! BSG had an issue. They reached out to let steam know. Steam solved the issue within hours. Take notes BSG, this is how a real company actually fixes fucking issues"

bandanamanastana,"Are Russian copyrights still enforceable? What's to stop someone in the US from rereleasing the game, but taking 15 minutes on the backend to fix the annoying bugs and removing the flea?"
HaZarD_SFD,This is 100% on the person paying for EFT on steam.  I am having a small aneurism just trying to comprehend the amount of IQ required to make a mistake like this.
Tankeverket,"No shit, they wouldn't list it without first making an official announcement and then letting people wishlist the game before the actual event"
BecomePnueman,Don't buy the game at all.  You will be happier and healthier.
I-wanna-fuck-SCP1471,Steam's complete lack of quality control shines again
Exit-Putrid,"Weird because I'm fairly certain there are pre-checks to posting a game on steam, especially one as big as Tarkov. 

Secondly, the reason why people complain so much about cheaters do not understand how long it takes to 1, get a very good understanding of the game and mechanics, and loot / quest items. One death can prevent you from progressing for quite some time.   


BSG prob should DMCA? Why would they not do this when it was first noticed it was on Steam?"
bdurand, BSG will quickly acknowledge something like this but not cheaters
mynameajeff69,"Bro, why would anyone even think that was real, BSG would make a huge announcement if they got tarkov on fucking STEAM."
Key_Transition_6820,"Are people actually falling for that? Why would you buy a game on steam if you already own a copy?

I guess people that haven't got it yet would do such a thing."
Puzzled_Inflation_95,Report it to steam website as well
Scavwithaslick,Bro
KasukaDragon,It just got taken off steam.
beansrreal1,"Well, fuck. Guess I'll have to wait and see if steam will refund me."
Sad_Temperature_7455,Don't buy it at all; Sorted.
aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,Lol people are dumb.
NappingGod,I hope that guy made a lot of money from all the dumbass people who bought it
JSOCoperatorD,"Dis is Tarkov, you buy direct from mother Russia, everyone know dis."
DrHighlen,How is that allowed?
roflwafflelawl,BSG and EFT aside does Steam have any moderation when it comes to the games that are allowed to go up? I assumed everything not from a big developer or publisher needed to be greenlit before even popping up in search results but its seems like it's much easier to do it than I thought?
Bradur-iwnl-,oh man i wanted to see that. Its already gone :(
Thirdai_,Pretty sure it already got taken down. I couldn’t find it after seeing Axel’s video.
turtlemaster4,crazy how people do this kind of shit...
FaithlessnessDeep492,"If this isn't a sign of EFT itself being an actual scam I don't know what is.  
It's a cheat infested hellhole, not a game.

Don't waste your time with it, any of you."
Sundic2,Just bought it. Will report
leeverpool,"Man I hoped this was true. At least having the game on steam and showing that Mixed reviews if not negative given the current state of the game, could have been a wake up call for Nikita. 

Coping, I know."
artosispylon,"tbh its less of a scam than the actual EFT game atm, at least you can refund it on steam."
BeefyZealot,"I want to buy it just to leave it a negative review. We all got scammed, this would balance it out."
Vncenzos,I will buy it just to spite Nikita
bufandatl,I bought 10000 copies and currently reselling to banned cheaters.
Rootorii,What do you guys think the review will be if EFT release on steam at the current state? Above or below 50%?
ledqueen,"My socials, steam and tarkov got hacked for couple of hours today (someone got to my gmail account), finally I got it all back with minor casualties. Can this be connected?"
delfivesi,how is it even possible!?
Obtainable20,"Damn, I was actually about to buy this a few days ago while checking out the game. It looks 100% legitimate with only a cursory glance. This is an impressive scam."
Exit-Putrid,"Lmfao, this was reported like 6 hours ago and yet it's still up on Steam market."
mrbawkbegawks,no... shit....
Hendeith,How broken is steam review process if you can literally list game you don't own and they are unable to catch it.
throwaway_733773,"Just report this steam posting as fraud please, enough reports will get it removed and save new players from buying it on steam."
JIssertell,Hackers got bored of ruling every raid w/o consequences so they moved on to just trying to scam and steal real money with eft
MagicSceptre,"BSG will never allow tarkov to come to steam, they are happy with it staying in their own launcher for many reasons."
HokumB3123,Like the actual game isn’t a scam at least steam has refunds
abramthrust,"Plot twist:

It actually *IS* Nikitta behind the steam listing, as a double false flag scam to wring a few more sales out  before people get sick of the state of the game."
