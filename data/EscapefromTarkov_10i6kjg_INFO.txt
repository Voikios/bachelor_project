{"Title": "The Vulture", "Post Text": "I am the vulture.  I prey on dead players and scavs.  You typically won\u2019t see me until there\u2019s 10 min left in a raid when I leave my roost and converge on the carrion for a feast.  \n\nI\u2019ve watched the whole raid from my perch above Oli, where I drink my water and slickers.  Some rats and chads are able to scurry past unharmed, but many are not.  \n\nI see a thick chad through my valday, crawling by the blue wall towards emercom, laden with loot.  I almost feel bad as my silenced AKM rains PS ammo down on to him.  There\u2019s no where to hide, and he has no idea where to shoot back.  His thick body laying lifeless, my belly grumbles with hunger but my instinct is to wait.  Wait in my nest until the other scavengers come to feast.  It\u2019s not long before player scavs are surrounding the carcass.  With a well aimed shot, they are put down, but more keep coming, unaware of the vulture circling overhead.  After the bodies are piled up high, the vulture drops his insured weapon and armor in order to fully gorge himself as the raid timer drops below 5 min.  A FIR Ledx on a player scav? I squak in triumph and bristle my wings.  This is the year of the vulture!\n\nBeing a vulture is a way of life, and as a lone male, I justify it as nature taking its course.  Does the lion mourn the death of the gazelle?", "ID": "10i6kjg", "Score": 2546, "Total Comments": 263, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10i6kjg/the_vulture/"}
