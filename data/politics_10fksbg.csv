sgr84ava,This motherfucker was grown in a lab by The Onion.
Reasonable_Set6780,He's lived quite a life. Or maybe he hasn't; it's pretty hard to tell conclusively.
CorwinOctober,This is like Catch Me if You Can if the protagonist was weird and dumb.
Mephisto1822,Does this guy even exist?
AngelaMotorman,You can't make this stuff up.
Skelter89,"Christ, I need to start selling Santos Bingo cards."
cuirboy,"The lying and the grifting seemed to be fine with the GOP, but will they tolerate the drag?"
detectivetomscoggins,"There’s this and there’s memorial dog money he stole. George Santos does not fuck around. You could find him going through your drawers and to your face he’d go, “I’m not even here right now.”"
stunticon86,Is there a legitimate reason why everyone is just letting this guy walk around with no accountability?
HallucinogenicFish,Reality is just trolling us at this point
Financial_Pool_9273,Reminder - nothing wrong with being a drag queen - what’s cringeworthy is the hypocrisy
Turtledonuts,"Alright Santos bingo card time: 


Claimed that he served in the IDF | Claimed that he slept with a famous gay celebrity  | Was once a member of the Communist party | Involved in a puppy mill  | Faked his own death at least once 
---|---|----|----|----|----
Isn't a US citizen | claimed he was allergic to meat | Claimed that he worked at the Mint | Wanted in europe | Has multiple illegitimate children 
falsified votes for primary run  | Claimed that he was in danger from the cartels | Free Space: made campaign promises | Involved in an immigration scam | Already stealing shit from the capitol building  
Wore a butt plug on the house floor | claimed to be a recovering alcoholic | attempted to blackmail a NY GOP official | Claimed that he stormed the capitol | Has an incurable STD 
Took money from an actual FSB agent | doubles down on a lie on live TV | Excuses a lie with a more insane sob story | claims he has an evil twin | performed sexual favors for a congressman"
Papazigzags,"Another wild twist in this preposterous, disgraceful saga. Santos has turned out to be many of the things that Republicans publicly rail against, yet they have no intention of booting him. But a vote is a vote, so it's all ok"
gnome08,"Reminds me of the GOP congressmen who was filmed naked on a bed, jumping around & pelvic thrusting his ""friend"".

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10784533/amp/GOP-Congressman-Madison-Cawthorn-responds-nude-thrusting-video.html"
zoeyjax,This is becoming a meme. I can't keep up.
lew_rong,"When do we start putting quotes around ""George Santos's"" name?"
FirmestSprinkles,we live in a simulation that is about to end and the 12-year-old kid at the controls has been fucking with us these past few years.
gogojack,"In his defense, Santos says he was just ""drag-ish."""
XarmtheinsaneX,This guy is like a hundred red flags in a trenchcoat
crovax3000,These Sacha Baron Cohen stunts are getting elaborate.
peter-doubt,Something about him made me expect this!
dust-ranger,Leaning into the gay/drag thing is probably the only way to get the GOP to boot this grifter. He's otherwise a role-model republican.
ejpierle,"Because OF COURSE he was a gay, drag queen. Fucking of course. I swear to God, just listen to whatever these assholes are crusading against at any given moment and then wait until it comes out that they are the ones doing it. I wish there was an S in their name so I could add ""Self Loathe"" to Gaslight. Obstruct. Project."
MysteryNeighbor,"I could see a news headline about Santos unzipping himself and revealing that he’s actually the cast of Homeward Bound and I wouldn’t be surprised 

Is anything about this man real?"
blueberrydonutholes,House Republicans are at the point (and have been for some time) where it’ll have to be a ‘dead girl or live boy’ scandal for them to *do* anything. Hypocrisy doesn’t even faze them anymore.
YSU90,"Also claimed his mother survived being in one of the twin towers during 9/11, but died 3 years later of cancer. When in fact she left the country in 1999 and didn't return until 2003."
Reddituser45005,"This might actually be the deal breaker for republicans. Lying ,not a problem. Stealing from charity, not a problem, fake resume, not a problem.  Being a drag Queen.  That goes too far."
transhighpriestess,"Hey, I’m going to nitpick the title a little, but I feel like I should say that dressing in drag and being trans are two different things. 

Both are fine. Some trans people do drag. But drag is a performance and a costume. Transphobes like to equate trans women with drag queens because they think of us as “men in dresses.”

Anyway, I’m sure that’s not what the OP was doing here. But I felt like I should point it out."
shadowdra126,Next we will find out he isn’t even a citizen
internalschism,I will only refer to this person as “Kitara” from now on.
,"I just can’t take the hypocrisy.

Worse than that is knowing what you do, and who you are in your private life and denying that to other people for personal gain.  I couldn’t live with myself."
Ika_bunny,Are we sure this is not a John Oliver prank that went too far
niferrenee,Everything I have learned about this guy has been against my will
Traveler_Constant,"It's clear he chose Republicans, not for their views, but for their gullibility and complete lack of moral fiber."
slowhand201,His drag name was Hedda Lettuce
CandyCoatedHrtShapes,JFC the GQP will end him over this I hope.  Drag queens are the new boogie men.
fmfbrestel,"When you can't tell the satire articles from the real thing anymore, you know you're watching a grade-A dumpster fire."
19southmainco,GOP gonna start giving him the Cawthorn treatment now
yourmomwasmyfirst,This guy's like a Russian doll
Lighting,"I thought it was odd that McCarthy caved to this guy. 

Remember a few years ago the conservative reporter scandal where the guy let into the [conservative press core was outed as a gay porn star](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2005/2/8/91058/-)? 

I'd bet there's something else going on here with McCarthy and Santos and the rest of the ""new conservatives"" that seems to be oddly attracted to sex crimes like Gaetz.

I'd look to see if McCarthy took any trips to Brazil or places where Santos was nearby.  [Hmmmm](https://www.speaker.gov/leader-mccarthy-codel-travels-to-brazil/)"
waitingonothing,"Santos lived in two countries, under several assumed names, married a woman while having a consensual/problematic relationship with another man, scammed people on GoFundMe, ran for congress and won.

But the drag. The GOP will not stand for the drag."
meatballlover1969,"LMAO, this shit like a comedy/tragegy show at this moment"
jigsaur1,"I just heard a rumour that he’s really a hologram and comes from the planet Zog. Makes pretty good sense - given what we think we might (or might not) really know about the, er, man."
TheDoctorDB,Pretty soon he’s gonna claim to be Batman
PM_Literally_Anythin,"After all the reprehensible things he’s done, dressing in drag may be the thing that actually sinks him with the Republican Party."
kcexactly,Does it ever stop with this guy.  Yesterday I saw his former roommate on the news saying Santos stole his scarf.  I mean what in the actual fuck.  At first I thought he was just some scammer idiot.  Now I am thinking the guy has some serious mental health issues.  I am fully expecting this guy to have literal dead bodies in a basement at this point.
emvthewoman,doing drag has nothing to do with being trans
AThriceDippedChip,This guy’s basically Carmen Sandiego at this point
taatchle86,His real name is Randall Flagg.
psufan5,This country is truly under attack and sanity is losing.
toughguy375,Finally a reason for republicans to turn against him.
ZeroSaga,"I am so intrigued, and perplexed as to how the hell he got as far as he did in the process!? There needs to be a movie about this guy lol."
CosmicComet17,I feel so sorry for organizations like The Onion because how do you make up funny news stories when reality comes up with shit like this?
AnalSoapOpera,Russian Oligarch donated to him. How do we know Russian didn’t put him up just to troll us to how fucked our elections are?
powpowpowpowpow,"How has this guy avoided the ""groomer"" label?  It's almost as if Republicans don't actually believe their own propaganda, or if they do, they are fine with child predation on their team."
catsasss,"Both the BBC News Quiz and Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me dragged this dude hilariously in their most recent programs.  He’s no longer a news scandal, he’s a byword for outrageously over the top embellishment.  Good thing he’s already got some aliases, cause the name George Santos is beyond recovery at this point.

There is a whole generation of men named “George Santos” who need to look into name changes post haste."
jpjohn49,"I really hope that Santos becomes tRumps, vice President in 2024."
Runjit,"So no one thinks having a guy who's background we can't verify in the government is risky at all? Man have standards fallen, best buy does better background checks"
CanadianJediCouncil,"This guy is like an advent calendar of daily scandals, frauds, and lies"
PrincessAegonIXth,On today’s episode of “Don’t fuck with journalists”
Bicky_Franson,"Ok what the hell, this guy has as many stories as an Arrested Development character"
reddit_cmh,Being a drag queen does not mean you’re trans. Being trans does not make you a drag queen. The two are separate and only sometimes do they intersect on an individual basis.
askmeifimacop,This is gonna make a great movie some day. George santos makes the Catch Me If You Can guy look like an amateur
Skeptic135,I’m waiting for the videos of his drag queen days to come out.  🍿🍿🍿
TurbidusQuaerenti,It just keeps getting more and more ridiculous. This would be hilarious if it weren't also so scary and sad.
Bladehawk1,Will be really funny is he's actually a Democrat. After all he lied about everything else.
stonedtarzan,I got 10 bucks on the next headline being he murdered his mom on 9/11 causing covid
Agitated-Tadpole1041,Republicans in a pickle now.
prescience6631,"Mark my words, the drag queen background is the line in the sand that will cost Santos/Devolder/Kitara his committee assignments and spot in the house.

Fraud is tolerated…..nay welcomed by the GQP — but they’ll be damned if they allow any non-binary person into their ranks. George bout to be yeeted like Madison Cawthorn."
sveeger,"I bet the GOP is leaking some of this info.  Look at all the headlines dedicated to this clown recently?  Is anybody paying attention to whatever excuse for policy the rest of the party is pushing?  No, we’re too busy being distracted by this jack hole."
nik-nak333,This story keeps getting wilder and wilder. Do we ever reach the point where they throw him under the bus?
lamsham69,He fits right in for all them sexually oppressed right wingers
crappyassparts,"Well, yeah, back then all-ages drag shows were winning Donald Trump's Celebrity Apprentice season finales..."
dmtandcrumpets,i could see this being the straw that breaks the camels back and gets him ousted from holding office..theyll back all the other scummy shit but drag is a no no.
FattieBrain,Honestly this keeps getting better and better.  Can’t wait to see what’s next!
omniocean,LMAO love or hate it this guy is going to be the source of many movies and books and probably get rich AF off all this.
United-Cockroach-980,GOP -Every accusation is a confession
Kendog75,Does anyone remember the Howard Dean yell that derailed his campaign?
riderkay,"Come on now, whoever is writing the script for this simulation is not even trying now."
Wizzle_Pizzle_420,This dude is like the Forrest Gump of fuckery
Tannerleaf,"I don’t really know who this man(?) is, or what he does, but then again, does anyone?

Regardless, why does every photograph of him look like he was just parachuted into the situation? He always looks so confused, as if his brain has only just now been brought to quasi-coherent consciousness.

Disclaimer: Not American."
Ivorcomment,"In any ethical party, with the lies and corruption this individual has already exhibited, he would have been immediately dismissed and exiled, yet in the Republican Party he is given committee appointments. 

This alone tells everyone where the G.O.P  stand’s  when it comes to morals - power is everything and Kevin McCarthy would sell his grandmother to the devil to possess the congressional gavel. To do so he is prepared to sell it to the likes of Mad Taylor Green, Bimbo Boebert, Moronic Gaetz, Gym Jordan and Pathetic Gosart. Would anyone expect anything else from  someone who possesses the ambitions of a  narcissist, the abilities of a junior grader and the spine of a jellyfish. God help us all who are compelled to endure the stupidity of these clowns."
Ok-Ease7090,The GOP doesn’t care he’s a liar but will they care he’s a transvestite?
Prophet_Of_Loss,I doubt the party of hypocrisy cares. They'd seat  a Russian spy in Congress if it pisses off the libs.
TheDiceMan2,"this is probably too nuanced for a lot of you, so here come the downvotes, especially in this subreddit...... doesn't it set the drag and/or trans community (two different communities, i understand) back when a story of someone displaying hypocrisy with regards to one of those communities is used as a ""gotcha"" against that hypocrite?? it feels like it reinforces the stereotype from people who think it's ""bad"" or ""immoral"" or whatever they say that this is something that people should be ridiculed for, instead of celebrated or at the very least accepted... by pointing this out to the public, there will now be people who become more likely to call for his ouster than there would have been before they knew he had participated in a drag show, so this ultimately confirms their beliefs that ""drag = bad,"" no? like, if the ""other side"" is bringing this up about his past, it must *really* be bad, you know? that's what i imagine a diehard MAGA person to be thinking when they see this. 

that's just my thought whenever i see some story about republican hypocrisy with regard to any social issue out there (i'm painting broad strokes with the phrase ""social issue,"" i don't mean to imply that dressing in drag or being trans is a ""lifestyle choice,"" i'm just trying to use concise and inclusive language for the sake of wrapping things up) . just let the hypocrisy speak for itself, it doesn't need to be an entire news cycle."
tydestra,"This dude is a bingo card of a human.

Also Drag ≠ Trans."
fartjokes4prez,"You are aware that dressing in drag and being trans are completely fucking different, right?"
photato_pic_guy,Goddam this guy makes my life seem boring AF.
erock84titan,Nobody hates Gay folks more than a Closeted one
moonbouncecaptain,"As much as I want to boot this idiot in the pants... I find him fascinating. I have so many questions. What's his villain origin story? Is this some long con, LARP, or documentary? What made him hate himself so much? Who is he running from or toward? Why did he have to create this character? Who's on his staff? Does he have one? I wouldn't work with him. It's like a Manchurian candidate gone wrong."
Tatooine16,"He is a national embarrassment, but I'm torn between being  sad that he's such an embarrassment for the gay community and being delighted that he's such an embarrassment for the Republican Party."
LoveDeluxe,"This is bad reporting, being a drag queen has nothing to do with being trans. It’s better to stick with the “he’s gay but the party is homophobic” view. This is just conflating two very different things."
Hot-Bint,Before I get excited I am going to wait for a bigger outlet with a hardier legal department to vet this. A blurry newspaper clipping aint it.
redditor1101,Ok but drag is not trans tho
BleepinArc,I’m convinced this motherfucker doesn’t even exist.
Tim_Allosaurus,Drag and trans are not really the same thing or equal.
Alice__L,I feel like George Santos is deep within the Tyson Zone by now being that lately none of the shit that's coming out about him is fazing me even in the slightest.
OGodIDontKnow,This lying dingbat is like the headlines from “The Onion” only they fucking real.
swedishfordeer,"Whenever I see this guy I can only think of Robby from the show New Girl, which sucks because Robby is one of the best characters in that show and I don’t want to associate the two :("
colcourtney,The GQP are very repressed. A lot of issues there.
Unhelpful_Applause,Has this reached sitcom level of parody in reverse?
XL1200N,Nothing the GQP does surprises me anymore
Hopeful-Ad1887,I don't understand why republicans accept him as a congressman.
mt8675309,This may be a prerequisite for the hypocrite party coming up.
justinmillerco,Could you imagine having to be this guy’s Communications Director?
WorthRecognition5663,This is just getting to be so ridiculous. I can't with this guy.
Loharp45,"He copied Trumps playbook, run as a Republican because they’re easy to fool."
Billyraycyrus77,Is it ok to call him “Jewish Hershel walker”?
myownzen,"Jesus christ. Where does it end with this fella???

Of course the republicans put him on a committee, too."
sockless_bandit,Can someone please tell me who the fuck is this guy.
PotatoBomb69,How is every headline I see about this guy more outlandish than the last
Gummy_yumyum,I’m beginning to think this guy might be Quantum Leaping
Coooo8,"Holy shit, I can't believe the plot twists this season. The show-writers have outdone themselves, truly."
lifeat24fps,Every day. Every. Single. Day. Every day there’s something new about this jackass.
devilsbard,"Uh oh. Just like Madison Cawthorne, he’ll be done in by some crossdressing, not all the other terrible shit he’s done."
MarkHathaway1,"So, like so many of the other radical Right-wingers, he had things to hide and was somehow plucked out of nowhere to suddenly become a wealthy Republican member of Congress.

Where have we seen this nonsense before?

It's as though the top of the Republican food-chain (Donald Trump) used the government spy system to gather evidence on people who could be blackmailed, threatened, or bought to do their bidding. All these crazies appear to be simple puppets of Trump and perhaps Putin.

Can this go well? No.

What can be done about it? Shame them? Ha. They have no shame. But, revealing and shaming it is as a starter. After that who knows."
