Notinyourbushes,"Damn, that's great!  Props to your photographer, I thought this was a painting at first glance."
sandervessies,"Damn, not only are your makeup skills amazing, but the editing and the photoshoot served you justice too! I would think this was a fanart from one of those realism artists because of how perfect it is to be real."
AstronomicalWood,Hard to tell if it's real or the game. Great job on the bite mark!
Cali4Ya,Ya smell me?
SharpenedToenail,You posted this a month ago and got over 70 thousand upvotes on it
AdvancedBegger,This was posted months ago with similar comments how most of her stuff is heavily edited and that she should post the unedited ones.
Rizenstrom,"I really wish cosplayers included links to raw, unedited photos as well. It's really hard to appreciate a cosplay when you can't tell how much of it is even real anymore.

I'm not going to be one of those ""this isn't cosplay"" people, it quite obviously is, but is the cosplay doing the heavy lifting or the editing? I can't tell. I want to be impressed by the cosplay but I just can't be when I don't even know how much of it is real.

Like that bite mark, the bruising, blood - makeup? Or editing? What about the weathering on the shirt/ pants? The face shape - makeup illusion or editing?

Edit: 

Hopefully this helps people understand better: there are two ways to appreciate art. As a whole and as individual components. Think of it like any other art form. 

If I draw something there's the drawing as a whole and then there's individual components. Linework, shading, color, perspective, proportions, etc. I can have really good linework and shading but a bad sense of perspective or proportions. 

Now I *could* load that up into photoshop and edit out the flaws and upload that drawing and get a bunch of upvotes but that would be a bit disingenuous, no? 

You can appreciate the *photo* but it's hard to appreciate the *cosplay* when you can't tell where it ends and editing begins. 

There's no more room for criticism or improvement, or ability to appreciate and compliment what was well done, when something is heavily edited."
xxCrimson013xx,Why do I have a feeling this was made using AI art?
beardobreado,And now without photoshop
EducatingMorons,Good editing
Human_Robot,"I struggle with calling this much post processing cosplay. Digital art absolutely. But I feel like this image is so heavily edited it loses realistic qualities that makes it actual cosplay. Unless you are cosplaying Ellie as a character from A Scanner Darkly I suppose. It's good digital work don't get me wrong, it just doesn't seem like proper cosplay.  

I know likeassassin is worshipped on Reddit and that much of her work is similar in terms of editing so this is unlikely to be a very popular opinion but oh well."
hazzman888,Cosplay?
Good_Smile,"HOLD THE FUCK ON

You literally posted this last month on this very subreddit and got over 100k upvotes. Not enough?"
JaceUpMySleeve,It‚Äôs so heavily edited that I feel like this hardly even counts as a cosplay at this point.
shaojun1006,This is so beautiful! I thought it was taken straight out of the game.
Hirutenko,Nice try Ellie I know that‚Äôs you
gex80,Do you have a pre-processed version?
squilliams1010,Cosplay??????
CrusaderNoRegrett,"I can‚Äôt really like most of cosplayers I see, because of so many filters used. It doesn‚Äôt look real"
DepressMyCNS,"You're dead ringer for ellie honestly. They should have cast you instead! I can't be the only one unhappy with Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey aren't exactly the best choices. I'm way more upset about Pedro than Bella. He just looks nothing like Joel, he's way to skinny of a build."
schlackbob,"I am fawning over your prosthetic makeup skills... that bite mark looks real to me! If I was asked to cosplay, I would make use of this as an inspiration simply because it's the best I have seen so far."
Hatescroller,That's not a raw photo and everyone who says it's not edited don't know what they are talking about.
2014shafiei,What a sight to see! I've been on a brain rot and this made me appreciate Ellie even more.
GimmeTheJuiceee,Should've been you in the show
Xeludon,You look more like her than the actress in the show.
Yaksha78,"Pepople don't seem to understand the meaning of costume player. The aim was never to build an armor but to put a costume on. You disrespect the hobby if you bash at people for just wearing clothes. 47 from Hitman is just that so are Android 17 and 18 (wig excluded if needed) and many more. As both cosplayer and photographer, I can tell you that the editing seem big but I can asure you it's not that much. If the make up is good, if the light set up is also good, it won't takes hours to get that result.  


Good job to everyone who made that picture happend"
retroracer33,"im sorry but these ""cosplays"" are whack. you basically put on a shirt and backpack and then used a program to do the rest."
keojudo,This is a cosplay? I thought someone took a screenshot lol. Great job!
majorminorminor,Sorry too much post processing. Why ruin the shots?
tmarshall91,My eyes must be fooling me... this is way too good!

ANAL_TOOTHBRUSH,You posted these last month karmer farmer
nolongermining,Nice cosplay! This would definitely make some lit coscards.
rdvp84,"This has to be a 3d model because if it isn't... I'd lose my mind. With all seriousness, you did great OP! This is so refreshing to look at because it's pure perfection."
MolestingSandwich,CUBE IM SWAGGIN OUT CHAT
Mandula123,The LoU fan base is too obsessed with a little girl and what she looks like.
PeeSockWithFetus,Definitely photoshopped
MunsMatt,Great cosplay! I find our compliments a bit too underwhelming for your amazing cosplay though.
imjjrs,Now that is one hell of a cosplay! I can't stop staring at this...
Tony2s,You did a great job on this cosplay! The make up is spot on.

saket999,Magnificent. Imagine new cosplayers having to look like the little ogre that they cast as Ellie in the TLOU show
BaronChubbb,Took me a minute to believe this was a cosplay! That‚Äôs a solid 14 year old Ellie. Are you gonna do Part II?
Big-Construction-471,"cosplay?this is Ellie from the game!

great job btw congrats"
alcoppi,You've set the standards so high at this point! Your makeup looks flawless. I am grateful that I read the title twice because I would've thought that this was only a screenshot from the actual game
roguesilverhand,"This is what the Ellie in the tv series should of looked like, she looks way too different for my liking but good actor"
barmenyo,Cool cosplay! I thought this was a spoiler from the game itself.
lazypieceofcrap,Imagine if the show's Ellie looked anything at all like this instead of a completely different looking character with the same name. I'm prepared for downvotes since 'everyone loves it.'
-Tuesday,"Did a double take when I read cosplay, looks straight out of the game"
ScaricoOleoso,"It makes me think about how dirty the post-apocalyptic future is, like, is everyone walking around itchy as hell and infected with EVERYTHING? ü§î"
TheHearthGuard,That‚Äôs a cosplay? Looks straight from the game I honestly thought it was a screenshot lol
FairFaxEddy,"My wife‚Äôs words - not mine, but I agree - the show would be more compelling if they cast a cuter Ellie, especially when the daughter was that cute"
Funkapotamus_,"Nice try, ‚ÄúVeronica.‚Äù"
LukXD99,"OP really posting a screenshot of TLOU and calling it cosplay!

Jokes aside, looks incredible! Especially that blood makeup! (At least I hope it‚Äôs makeup!)"
bighead1008,Anyone else think they messed up the casting for the upcoming show?  I just think the person they chose doesn't look like Ellie.
HaderTurul,Should've cast YOU for the TV show...
likeassassin,Photo Milliganvick
Fenris-Ulfir,I love the Redditors who knows nothing about cosplay or photo editor carefully explaining why this isn't really cosplay because they did post-processing on the photo (like is done to literally every photo)

L2Hiku,All you haters really need to see the other pictures of this. You're all looking real pathetic. Just check out her profile
Commercial_Working56,You should have played as Ellie in the HBO series
oliv_killer,"I mean, you can't totally tell if it's the game or if it's real, and I think this makes it even more perfect because it shows how well you did a good work."
snapdragon15,Is there any plan or something for last of us and dbd to cross over it could work incredibly
