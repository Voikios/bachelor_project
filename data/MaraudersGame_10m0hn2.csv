HarleyDFLSTC,I run an experiment where I go in weaponless and shout help when I see folks. Everyone so far has killed me.
CasualRascal,The only part about proximity chat that could be *really* bad is someone flooding the mic with loud noise so you can't tell where they're coming from exactly.
Whole_Ad_4989,"I think there should be some benefits or reasons to not to kill other players, especially newer players or players with no good loot"
Cool-Expression-4727,"I've had ONE positive interaction with someone, where we both spent the majority of the match trying to shoot down the baron. When we boarded we did the friendly dance and killed baron and split the loot.

While I think it would be cool if we could message players later or something like that, I don't know if I would play Marauders if I has to listen to some squeaker calling me a name etc.

It would, however, be neat if there was more non-combat ways to interact, perhaps.  Maybe when we get more mods for ships, they will create a neutral raid zone or something Ala Rust, where we can voice chat etc"
Amaninthetrees,"The compromise for having VOIP in the game would be the chirping system from Tarkov where you can have a player in your sights and hit a specific function key to say ""cooperate"" which appears on their screen (bottom right corner, small text) as ""[playername] would like to cooperate with you"". 


Hesitant for VOIP as I love f1 being the universal language."
