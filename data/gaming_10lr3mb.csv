CronkleDonker,Technically he's trusting his life to his armour
robindownes,"He uses it, but he doesn't trust it."
bike_tyson,"Let‚Äôs fist fight, but I‚Äôm covered in metal and you‚Äôre not"
lBobwhite,"Seems very contradictory. That exoskeleton is literally his life support, it‚Äôs really his body. But he is talking the ways of a professional soldier that both of them are and the fight between them in Zanzibar.

Also that‚Äôs Kojima telling you if you trust too much in your weapons in the game you are going to have a harder time. Game is easier without shooting and killing everyone. Including this fight against Cyborg Ninja."
PasswordisP4ssword,Bet he wished he had a weapon when he got a beating in ZL
Led_Halen,GRAY FUCKS
Kelbeross,""".....Hurt. Me. *More*!"""
Martyrdoom17,Replayed this classic a week ago. Thought the same thing.
Air-Bo,And he‚Äôs a genetically enhanced super solider. So you‚Äôre even
HotelSolid9731,HURT ME SNAKE.. I WANT YOU TO HURT ME MORE DAAAWG
Your__Pal,"Gray Fox deserved better. 

One of the biggest badasses in gaming."
montesa250,Can we all just appreciate what it was like when you first entered the hallway prior to this battle though?
HotCheese650,"Directed by Hideo Kojima

FranzKaka,Brings back so many memories. Like when the DARPA chief shits his guts out.
whysoserious370,Literally one of my favorites if not favorite game of all time
xerros,You‚Äôre that ninja‚Ä¶
temetnoscesax,i always laugh at this meme. so true.
TheBoundFenrir,"Standing here, I realize,

you were just like me; trying to `TRUST MY LIFE TO A WEAPON`"
bmack24,To be fair he never said he wasn‚Äôt a fool
Anal-Logical,"Don't forget the katana ! Really, this line should have been : Only a fool trusts his life to a gun."
Speedking2281,"This is similar to when Dr. Who would bemoan guns.  While he has a sonic screwdriver (aka: magic wand) that he had to use innumerable times so he wouldn't die.  In other words, he had to use his self-defense instrument to get him out of major, life-threatening jams.

I used to love Doctor Who. The really old ones, plus the ones from the 2000s. I haven't watched it a number of years, but yeah, the guns thing always made me roll my eyes."
RigasTelRuun,Snake  that's his disability aid.
ZenEvadoni,"Hey

You're that ninja"
Pittedstee,"I thought he was a cyborg, not just a guy wearing an exoskeleton?"
pjgab099,ü§£
Vex1111,still got fucked up in hand to hand combat
RaidSlayer,This scene is where Bollywood got their soap drama cut ideas.
Kingdom_of_salt,Oscar Nominee
Affectionate-Tie-212,üòÇ
xxxkings88,Psychomantis?
JohnnySasaki20,And a katana.
202042,"To be fair, he didn‚Äôt really choose this."
DrSyb,The flesh is weak.
AnonymousP30,Classic game right there even with the graphics it was ahead of its time.
AssaultEagle,I‚Äôd appreciate the battle much more if Snake did his ‚Äúaoww!‚Äù after each punch or kick.
Alternative_Gold_993,Does he actually say that?
HisSnakeIsSolid,Grey Fuck
Vandius,"He NEVER asked to be put in a cybersuit,  Grey Fox was found practically dead and a scientist put the suit on him. After he awoke with the suit he killed the doctors/scientists responsible for what happened to him."
SkeletalSoccer657,"Fair enough, he didn't actually pick this."
Roy_8886,"It's Kojima, he is a terrible writer. In this same game he mentions recessive genes as something ""malignant"". It's so bad and childish, you wonder if Kojima is really a gullible person. Another dumb example... that soldier who have diarrhea problems? He ends up marrying Meryl (yep, this is not a joke)"
Jedzelex,So the dude that made the meme thinks an armor is a weapon? Interesting.
DanielWhatUPs,why does he have a clown nose tho?
