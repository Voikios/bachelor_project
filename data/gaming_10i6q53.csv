HelpfulDrollery,"‚ÄüWhat are you doing?‚Äù
‚ÄüRemoving the ability to resurrect her. Let us see if anyone notices...‚Äù"
reversecowbird,That gentleman certainly appears to be in vigorous agreement.
altctrldel86,Does anyone know who these guys are? Would love to know what else they worked on after this.
morphindel,"Man, seeing 90s vg developers feels like seeing into some kind of secret world. I think because i had no concept of what went into making games back then,  and its like a piece of long lost knowledge"
Foxhound199,I think 1997 was peak cool.
PepperCertain,Does that guy have 3 mouths?
vertebraejones,Careful...they're heroes.
ThePoorPenman,Looks like they need to tighten up the graphics on level 3
Oh_My-Glob,Those Sony PVM studio monitors are highly collectible amongst CRT lovers these days. Nothing like enjoying retro content on the displays they were developed on
Jepperto,"Oh, just creating magic that would affect millions for decades."
Nomatad,What's up with the guy on the left's face?
CliveReadsReddit,This game had the best-looking cut scenes of it‚Äôs time. Now it looks like roblocks lol
ElectroFlannelGore,To be a fly on those walls....
fvelloso,Squaresoft >>>> Square Enix
Luverovlotz,Are there any more photos like this?
firstanomaly,"Wasn‚Äôt the development team the biggest in the industry at the time? 

Blew me away when I found out they got the menu to run at 60fps while the battle animations were at like 15-20."
Secretofthecheese,That‚Äôs actually the irl shinra monitoring hq
Windyandbreezy,The faces of 2 guys who have definitely spent some nights in the office trying to fix a a bug and get it right. Not all heroes wear capes
kahlzun,People forget how ground breaking this stuff was when it came out. FMV seamlessly blending into game play. 3d polygons. Action tracking camera shots in battles. Huge numbers of minigames.
dgeurkov,What software is on the right screen? Left seems like some unix based graphics desktop
zillskillnillfrill,What happened to striped shirt man? Too much mako?
Pixelchu25, This oddly feels like wallpaper material
killingerr,I love how these guys are wearing button shits an ties for a game dev job. True professionals.
pcm2a,"Apologies if this is common knowledge. Growing up my goal was game development. In the late 90s at college I finally realized that it would be the most erratic work/life balance ever. While I'm still glad I didn't go that coding route, I'm also envious of these people making games. I'm not envious of 300 hour work weeks for no extra pay, to be fired after the game is released."
BillyBean11111,"I saw someone playing FFVII at a party when it just came out and I couldn't believe how good it looked. At the time it was so outrageous, I had a ""I'm really living in the future"" moment."
SNES182,All those beautiful monitors.
Kuromeru,"Damn, 5 monitors?"
DrDarks_,Left dudes face is tripping me tf out
me_grimmlock,That‚Äôs really cool to see
tunesmiff,And they‚Äôre still working on it to this day.
Shunsazi,I hate that I am so cynical now that my first thought was that this was created by Midjourney...
4tune8SonOfLiberty,"Why is there not a documentary about this already?

It was low-hanging fruit for the 25th anniversary..."
AutomatedSaltShaker,Nice khakis
Funsized_eu,This was part of the reason I used to buy games magazines. Their 'behind the scenes' photographs were pretty awe-inspiring as a child.
MatttttyF,Guy on the left looks like he is wearing a mask of his own face
34HoldOn,"Pretty much the entire reason that the upcoming Nintendo 64 missed out on exclusively getting this game, was because Nintendo decided to make it a cartridge-based system.  Just adds to what a mind-numbingly terrible idea it was to do that."
f14_pilot,they look fried
StubbornPotato,I wonder if this is the same team who did xenogears.
Phil_Wild,Silicon Graphics computer in the bottom left.
Future-Agent,Cool.
MitchKramer1989,Amazing game.
ffximike,Dude has 5 monitors
UntestableHypothesis,Years ago I trained in Kyokushin karate and one of my classmates was a former Square dev who worked on FF7. He said it was an absolute SHITSHOW because they were just seat of their pants the whole time. He had long since left games and was at that point working on banking software. Cool dude.
IdaBidaGacy,"A thing of beauty. Hands down my favorite game I‚Äôve ever played. The story was amazing. I played part 1 of the remake and it was good but not the same. Need that open world but heard it‚Äôs coming in part 2?

Edit: is the update to part one just the same game with a little extra added? The intermission or intergrade whatever it‚Äôs called. I paid like 75 for the first edition so don‚Äôt really wanna pay more for the same game."
Shigarui,My man in the back most definitely approves. That's some serious head nodding going on.
FILTER_OUT_T_D,Man I would love a collection of development notes or other photos like this. FF7 is easily my favorite game and getting to know behind the scenes stuff is really interesting to me
Lightspeedius,"Heroes, every last one."
Rijsouw,Lady Gaga - Bad Romance
Burpmeister,[üëÉüëÉüëÑüëÑüëÑüëÑ wtf lol](https://i.imgur.com/UrlbepD.jpg)
Prairie2Pacific,Those guys made me cry.
homemadegarbage,This is giving meme vibes
kazo66666,This is the best game ever what a legend
tbuda88,What‚Äôs up with the left dudes face?
LightSparrow,Stuff like this fascinates me. I want more.  As someone in the tech field now and who loves games. It‚Äôs endlessly entertaining to see how the industry worked back in the day. Particularly this era maybe even earlier. What set ups they had what programs they used. Etc
SodiiumGames,The guy on the left looks like he's about to start fucking beatboxing
Gamer4life101,What‚Äôs is up with the guys face on the left?!!
ToMorrowsEnd,Why are they programming on a video editor?
Unfiltered_Rabbit,There's just something magical about the old school tech and seeing that old school tech setup and the creators creating a Game that is still getting lots of love decades later.
Arcanisia,"I remember looking at the polygons and being like, ‚ÄúWow. It looks so real.‚Äù"
KentD3000,"Good old days, where games were made by professional with the first objective to entertain. Now the first objective is to get gamer money as much as possible with stupid game pass and in app billing. At the end less than 1% users will get access to the full content of a game. Even a game you paid 70 bucks...."
Snotnarok,"Working, or, posing like they're working for magazine articles. 

2 shots of the FMV running on the top TVs, guy leaning back to make sure the monitors in shot. Guy nodding so hard the building applied for earthquake insurance shortly after."
crockett8513,I highly suspect this is an AI generated photo
Typo_of_the_Dad,"About 15 years from now, we're gonna ruin this aren't we?"
hahahawhatorg,I think I see a little bit of a smile on his face.
Equivalent_Wall_4915,2023 they shoulda duct tapped someone to the ceiling like that one meme
StevenLindley2016,I can't wait for Final Fantasy 90210!üòÅ
Ftpini,Ah back when they were aloud to make a great story into a complete game and they didn't have to chop into little pieces to sell years apart.  A different era.
Mike_0x,**WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FAAAAAAAAAAACE!?**
plaidverb,"How many of you can almost hear the hum from those CRTs?

Of those, be honest: how badly do you want to degauss a monitor right now?"
marcusmorga,"This is the moment they were deciding the Stats for the boss in the ice place. 

One guy says, whynot make it unbalanced.

Other guy, yea whynot."
DoomTay,"So it looks like all those monitors are showing different points in the intro movie, but...why?"
razirazo,Light theme IDE. Amazing.
LatenightGardener,"This is AI generated. Look at the hands and fingers dude.. lol, you guys got pranked so hard man. Pay attention to details folks. THIS IS NOT REAL."
codi-,funny how reddit is just a giant add now
dance_rattle_shake,"Light themed ide, bleh

Wow this sub has no chill. It's a joke you morons. Would have gone over great in r/programmerhumor"

D-TOX_88,Man. Those dudes look tired.
SleepyTobi,"wait, is that Hamada and Matsumoto?"
jbrooks84,That trackball mouse is fitting for the time.
giraffe_legs,This is dope as hell.
incorrigible_reacher,Wowwwwwwwe
The__Goose,"""It works. I don't know why but it now compiles and works. What if we go back to look through what changed and fix more.""

""No fucking ship it, we can't risk delaying it.""

Probably something being exchanged similar to that."
electricprism,Has anybody decompiled FF7 to source code yet?
xAbzzx,Amazing
FistsoFiore,This shot could be an outtake from The Matrix.
GosuGian,5 monitors!
RWLXXII,The mouse on the bottom right.. It‚Äôs so ahead of it‚Äôs time
rockbottam,One of the coolest photos in gaming development
qBomb77603,Zoom in on the guy in the left üòÖ
heapsp,"Its crazy to think about the hardware that must have been used. I wonder about stuff like what OS, how they kept it backed up, etc.
This was long before cloud computing and virtualization. They must have had a hell of a time collaborating with one person doing the lion share of the build."
Megalorye,Game pretty much defined my childhood.
darkbreak,90s game development sure was something. An entirely different beast compared to what we have now.
Main-Swing-3450,5 monitors in the 90s?  Ballin
artrubian,Doing the lords work
CaptMaxBlack,Nostalgia overload
DailySojourn,My step dad worked on this game near the end. Just helping put objects in rooms as far as I understand it.  He even has a watch that was given to some of the staff with the game on the face of it. He later worked on a project to try making a chocobo fighting game where 2 chocobo riders would battle each other.
ExplosPlankton,Those pvms üòç
JoeFajita,Exactly what situation would a developer have those 5 particular images on 5 different screens at once? That's a weird combination of things to look at.
cy13erpunk,"FUCKING MIND-BLOWING what they did with what they had available 

OFC also to have this kind of tech at your disposal in the 90s? OMFG"
TheAniReview,Look at all those HD monitors lol
name-classified,"what is the equipment I am looking at here.

OBVIOUSLY a mouse and keyboard but what are they really doing?

It seems more than just code and rendering plot points; just curious what game devs in this time period where going thru."
Misfire2445,That‚Äôs so awesome
drip_dingus,"Isn't this a mildly controversial image in the retro gaming crt vs pvm debate?

Some say most games were designed with consumer grade crt tvs in mind that have a pixel bleeding effect, while this would clearly show that professional video monitors were used for atleast some development teams."
Tonlick,Stripe shirt guy cracking up at the script.
psychoholica,Silicon Graphics workstation on the left. Most likely Softimage 3D generated the images on the screen.
SpaceWizardKing,I didn‚Äôt know it was developed at Shinra HQ
Xphile101361,As a fellow programmer... this is the correct number of monitors to have
Jejunum_89,"\-Why are you making that face?

\+I'm holding a fart dude. Please show me what you gotta show and let me go to the restroom.

\-OK, we will be playtesting the entirety of Disc 1.

\+Oh god, oh fuck..."
apexisalonelyplace,God bless them. Every single one of them.
Emincmg,And becoming one of them appearently
drphilsprodigy,What are those mouses(mice?)?
enkaydee,I'm still really wowed at how much of a departure FF7 was after FF6. I wouldn't have known The FF series had a more traditional medieval fantasy start if I hadn't played a few of the prior games first...
Evilmaze,Looks like the graphics are done and he's just doing the mechanics and stats. That's a lot of math.
Aprettygoodguy89,Still have this game on disc. Never played it
Sarato88,They look so freaking tired.
zye-LOANee,"Legends who are making legendary playable stories‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not only beautiful, but a wholesome sight to behold. ü•πü•≤‚ò∫Ô∏èü•∞"
ohokright,Guy on the left still under development
Clean-Difference2886,Loved that game one of the best games made
Bother_The_Weak,I love that they put a My Bloody Valentine reference in the game because they were listening to it so much.
x_Animefreakgal_x,"The screens on the top look like microwaves, more than a tv or computer screen."
