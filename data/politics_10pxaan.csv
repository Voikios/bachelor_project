barrio-libre,"I don’t get it. Even if you buy the fucked up ideology, how are you proud of attempting an attack, screwing it up, and then settling for hitting an 80 year-old man over the head with a hammer? I mean, even as a bottom-feeding fascist, you should be ashamed of yourself."
FormalPancake,"Last year at CPAC they had a big ass banner saying ""We Are All Domestic Terrorists"". Of course the GOP supports him."
silentjay01,"'He was only going to hammer her knees if she lied to him.'

No matter what she would have told him, he would have called her a liar and hammered her knees...and then her head.  

He was there to **KILL** her and the Right is still making jokes about it."
PayTheTeller,"CBS News in Chicago named News radio 780 engaged in the most outrageous and irresponsible reporting by a major outlet I think I've ever heard a couple of days ago regarding this issue

First they announced with great fanfare that Mr Depape was speaking out from jail. First of all, who ""speaks out"" from jail? You're in jail. You have to intentionally reach out to a prisoner if you want to hear what they said. The question that needs to be asked is why, when there have been a grand total of zero jailed mass shooters opinions and motives aired on this channel throughout the years, would you want to know what made this particular criminal tick? The only possible answer is to advance political violence

Next, they went on to announce that we should all be grateful for his actions. Then something about warning others about more like him or something like this. They then went on to happily announce that this guy would be posting his thoughts and motives on social media so, stay tuned to Newsradio 78!!!

What the absolute fuck. I've opined on propaganda lite before and it's so prevalent these days, we can't even spot it most times. But this, THIS is what they do, in a nutshell. This is the terrifying stuff. This is what will turn good public servants away from public service where they will be replaced with the next fascist. This is what motivates the subset of the most angry kool-aid drinkers sharpening their spears in the darkest corners of our society because they now know, their thoughts and motivations will be amplified by mass media if they take the big step. They don't provide any context to airing these motivations like Salon did in their writing for reporting on the same thing. They just left his words hanging out there in the breeze then moved on to whatever else their sold out writers came up with

I can't even believe what I'm hearing from our mass media lately. They most obviously have seemed to have picked a side and in this case, it was not the side of an attempted murder victim but rather, the attempted murderer along with the long and growing list of GOP political violence apologists"
Batmobile123,"""Live in fear and do what we tell you or we will kill you"". That's the World the Republicans want you to live in. That's their only policy in Washington. That's their vision of 'America'. The Bullies have taken over."

Anyna-Meatall,"The definition of terrorism is using violence to accomplish political ends.

He is a terrorist. The proud bois are terrorists. The Republican party is a terrorist party."
wholetyouinhere,"If you feel compelled to go back to the numerous threads where they all crawled out of the woodwork to proclaim he was Pelosi's gay, liberal lover, don't bother. They've already moved on to new talking points and probably don't even remember saying that.

That's the magic when you never *actually* believe anything -- you can say whatever you want from one minute to the next, and none of it has to make any sense."
DemiMini,Conservatives celebrated the attack and have continued to use it to take both Pelosis as well as liberals in general. Conservatives are the enemy of the American people.

GuzPolinski,"Did anybody on the planet think that this moron on his own came to the conclusion that he needed to attack the Pelosi’s? Of course not, of course he was emboldened by the Republican Party"
craniumcanyon,People commenting on my local news station's Facebook page are saying the attacker is Paul's gay lover and they were partying it up in their underwear and the video was doctored. The republican base is not tied to reality anymore. There is no saving them.
otiswrath,"Kavanaugh gets interrupted while having a high end steak dinner; Conservatives lose their minds over the transgression. 

Mentally ill man that their party leader whipped into a frenzy attacks an elderly man with a hammer with the intent to assassinate the Speaker of the House with said hammer; Conservatives say they deserved it. 

I am and have been an Independent my entire life. Voted for both main parties and some third parties over the years. 

The current GOP scares the shit out of me. In part for their rhetoric but primarily because after 1/6 they didn't learn a lesson."
HoratiosGhost,If you know a republican you either know  violent domestic terrorist or a complicit asshole.
SpaghettiSandwich,"Just compare and contrast Republican and Democrat reactions on political attacks. When Steve Scalise was shot at a Congressional baseball game practice, no one said it was a jilted gay lover. No one cheered the attack or called the mentally unwell man that did it a hero. No news networks gleefully showed footage and photos of it over and over, speculating on what *really* happened, wink wink. 

The GOP is a party of violence and unchecked, unwarranted hatred."
prules,"This is terrorism btw. 

But they’re still more worried about men wearing dresses."
Elegant_Tonight4037,Oh I’m glad they told me that the GOP has become the violent party only recently. I never would have thought that the last 7 years of constant political violence and acts of terrorism coming from their constituents would qualify them as the party of political violence until Salon told me about it!
Mand125,"Say the words:

**Radical Republican Terrorism**"
homebrew_1,Elon did as well when he tweeted out a conspiracy theory.
tilehinge,">a judge ordered the release of video footage that appears to show DePape beating Paul Pelosi, the husband of then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, with a hammer after refusing to listen to police orders to drop the weapon. The video is hard to watch, showing the suspect tackling Pelosi to the ground and viciously pounding him with a hammer while the police attempt to pull him off the 82-year-old man.

Not that the point needs more illustration, but this sequence of events just underscores how ***fucking useless*** police are. 

You can be the husband of the *Speaker of the House* - a pinnacle of privilege, - have the cops respond to an intruder call before the violence starts, get there, confront the suspect, armed, who refused to comply, and they will **STILL FAIL** to protect you from being beaten within an inch of your life."

criptohore,Conservativism is a mental illness.
Sparrowflop,"Something I've been wondering about.  At what point do I switch my public voter registration to Republican, so that I don't have to worry about people hunting me down in the future, Mcarthyism style?"
semaphore-1842,"Republican politicians (save for a precious few who have mostly since been purged from the party) turning a blind eye to, if not outright supporting or participating in the violent overthrow of democratic government on Jan 6, was probably bit of of a hint."
ProneToDoThatThing,"Sorry Kyle Rittenhouse. Party’s over. 

There is a new criminal POS for the GOP to worship. You’re yesterday’s news. They’ve moved on to DePape who they’ll lift up until these cops in Memphis go on trial then they’ll rush to get behind them. 

There will always be new human garbage for Republicans to defend and support."
platinum_toilet,"> Pelosi's attacker is proud of himself. 

Of course he is. DePape believes he has a good shot of getting a role in a 3 Stooges movie."
amcfarla,Should make sentencing a lot easier when he openly admits he did the crime.
Rule-Advanced,It’s weird that things like this are still presented as outliers and considered shocking. The GQP has made the turn to full on terrorism/fascism. This is the only platform they have left to stand on.
stephruvy,"There are a lot of uncanny similarities to the rise of the Nazis... Calling the political leader a clown, a failed coup (and they kept trying) worshiping the leader, political violence...."

CollapsasaurusRex,Do we wait until they start proudly calling themselves Nazis before we fight them like the Nazis they are?
chunkerton_chunksley,Fucker probably thinks he’s the next rittenhouse
trolleyblue,"I saw a guy today driving around with a 2A sticker (spelled with guns) and a republican elephant sticker. 

Show me democrats driving around with donkeys on their car. Maybe you’ll see a Bernie sticker here and there. Or the remnants of an Im With Her sticker. But proud party affiliation like that is weirdly for republicans and it’s all about weapons.

Edit - I’m just gonna address this here since there’s a lot of what-aboutism in the replies…I’m not denying that liberals have bumper stickers. But you don’t see extremist liberals (if that’s even a thing…) openly aligning themselves with a mainstream political party the way you do on the right."
Knighth77,It's not typical for crazies to control their insanity. They're going to get progressively worse. It's inevitable.
meezigity,"And for a lot of them, it’s “funny”. Instead of condemning the violence they use it for their memes and tweets to trigger the libs. We saw a slow ramp up in violence like the Trump caravan harassing a Biden campaign bus in Texas and recently a failed GOP candidate shooting at democrats’ houses. And the many campaign ads depicting violence against democrats. It’s just sad."
tahcamen,The guy wants to be the next Kyle Rittenhouse.
Del292,How is he proud of himself he couldn’t even take an 80-year-old man. that’s a big W for Pelosi
LostTrisolarin,So many “loving Christians” in my family thought it was absolutely hilarious when this happened. They think it’s great. I’m grieving my family the last few years. I don’t recognize who’ve they’ve turned into.
Goatgogoch,After the videos were released the GQP stopped reporting it was a gay encounter gone wrong. These worthless twatburgers need to face some consequences already….
Tough-Smile-5146,Conservatives have low intellect
Mr_Stiel,When’s this guy going to speak at CPAC? They can give him the Kyle Rittenhouse medal of valor.
Betyoullneverguess,"Man, the comments defending this dude. ""He's not a republican! He's a liberal!"" 

""Later, in an interview with investigators, DePape said he had intended to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage and question her over what Democrats had done to former President Trump. If she had lied, he said he intended to break her kneecaps.""

Hmmm. Yeah, definitely a liberal. Liberals love Trump. (Obvious /s)

And also this little gem: ""Despite saying he didn't want to jeopardize his case, DePape told KTVU he attacked Pelosi because ""liberty isn't dying, it's being killed systematically and deliberately."" 

The ""people killing it have names and addresses, so I got their names and addresses so I could pay them a little visit … have a heart-to-heart chat about their bad behavior,"" he asserted.

Followed by his ""apology"": ""I want to apologize to everyone. I messed up. What I did was really bad. I'm so sorry I didn't get more of them. It's my own fault. No one else is to blame. I should have come better prepared,"" he said.""

Yup. Sure sounds super liberal to me (/s). Couldn't possibly be a ""patriot"" conservative. They're so docile and would never resort to violence."

Conservatives reward these psychopathic morons because they push the GOP agenda of fear and oppression more effectively than any single lawmaker could dream."
CatboyInAMaidOutfit,Now?  Pretty sure it was well established before now.
Pure-Huckleberry-488,"Recently seen a headline from Fox News saying that they were calling for the DOJ to investigate CNNs reporting on the story claiming they edited the released video to make it look worse than it was. 

The video I saw was cops arriving, waiting for like 15 seconds, the door opening, the cops telling them to drop the hammer, someone says no and dude gets control of the hammer, swings and knocks him out. No cuts or signs there was any editing in the solid video I watched. 

What exactly is Fox News suggesting CNN did to alter the evidence?

It’s crazy to think they can just make whatever claims and no one holds them accountable. These people lying and claiming innocence on the attackers part after he was proud about doing it should be held financially responsible if not legally responsible."
Morial,He is proud of himself. He should get the max sentencing. Throw away the key.

Shacky_Rustleford,I don't see how a violent attack on such prominent political figures is written off by so many as not at all politically motivated.
Interesting_Ad1147,What do you mean “Now” ?? Jan 6 was the clear indication of violence.
meseeksordie,I feel like we should start referring to them as jihadist.
SoulingMyself,"Now?

Ah yes, because Jan. 6th, Buffalo, El Paso, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Denver, etc. were so peaceful.

ScumEater,"It's obvious that pumping these folks full of misinformation and then saying ""*someone* should really do something about this huge problem"" is exactly what leads to this violence.

woggle-bug,"I grew up with a dad that would make comments about ""Pelosi should be drug out into the street and horse-whipped."" so absolutely nothing about their mentality surprises me."
storysong52,"News organizations I mean actual news, doesn’t get enough support, which is why I support public media. They aren’t beholden to advertisers. 
Also, I’ve noticed that since there isn’t enough truly local news, the people they hire don’t dig with candidates. Locally, in a very liberal area, a Republican candidate for state representative presented herself as a moderate, a peacemaker. No one asked her for her actual beliefs or what she thought needed compromise. When I posted on NextDoor in response to a magazine editor who supported her, with skepticism, I was challenged to go out with this candidate for coffee. Within minutes, I learned that she had only lived in the state for three years, and indeed, she had a right wing agenda, and lots of stances that someone in media could have uncovered in maybe ten minutes of questioning. For instance, she saw nothing wrong with standing in line to vote (we have the most secure mail in voting in the country). She was completely uninformed about any instances when both mother and baby can’t be both saved in late term complications. She was a wolf in sheep’s clothing, taking VA Governor Youngkin’s playbook. I of course wrote letters to the editor to try and inform people, and my own social media. She lost. I don’t take credit for that, she was a long shot here. The point is, media doesn’t dig for truth anymore."

limb3h,"I think I get it.  If someone attacks Nunez or McCarthy we would likely feel a bit of what GOP is feeling right now.  But we would at least make an effort to condemn the violence.

The hatred for Pelosi by the right can’t be underestimated.  Right wing media and Trumpism wanted this to win elections."
gamerinagown,"Literally heard two men laughing and joking about it this weekend (Dallas, TX). Talking about how good the attacker’s form was and genuinely taking pleasure out of an 80 year old man being violently attacked in his own home with a hammer… People are losing all sense of humanity and empathy."
