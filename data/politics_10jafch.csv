iStayedAtaHolidayInn,Just call him a pathological liar
andytronic,"**FUCK NEW YORK POST**

They and every right-wing outlet are partially responsible for garbage like Santos getting elected, and now they're trying to profit off a problem they helped create.

We need to stop rewarding them with upvotes for clickbait headlines. They still exist to get people to vote their rights away, and still hate you if you don't vote GOP."
Truffans,Is George even Tony’s real name?
,headline writers won't even say lie when it's fucking verified. truth-challenged? wtaf is this garbo?

Dude is a fucking pathological liar.  Call him a fucking liar."
youngbloodoldsoul,"He didn't break the system, but if you ever needed more proof that the system is shattered then look no further."
DortmunderCoop,"You'd think the mountain of lies would simply disqualify him from sitting as a congress person?! It makes no sense whatsoever.

In the real world, if any of us lied to the level that he has, just to get a job, we'd be fired immediately as soon as the bosses found out. I mean JFC, how much corruption are people supposed to put up with?!

It's like Bizarro World around here.

edit: typo."
8to24,"Sadly he won't resign and Republicans will continue to work with him to ensure his vote. Worse still Santos will see his popularity rise as conservative folk to him. Santos is a liar but his lies ""own libs"" so conservatives love it."

coolcool23,"""Truth-challenged""

What kind of doublespeak is this? If I am understanding correctly we still have no way of knowing if this man is actually named George Santos, or Anthony Devolder, or Anthony Z., Etc...

A more accurate description of him would be ""Proven liar who refers to himself as George Santos"""
hjablowme919,"The only way Santos leaves is if they have enough evidence to file criminal charges against him. If they dig deep enough, fast enough, they will find them. But my guess is the current investigation will linger on for months.

RLoge85,They wanted that R next to the name. They deserve this.
HAbhijeet,"Just to clarify, one can have a completely fictional resume and still cannot be fired? People have to wait for him to do the right thing and resign?

Well, things were certainly different when I was the lead astronaut and the head of NASA. Of course, my supermodel wife would never allow me to lie to anyone since our multi billion fortune was built on hard work and ethical behaviour. She would never allow me to lie or misrepresent anything since I am running for the president of the US unopposed. It is also behaviour unbecoming of the chairman of the FED."

Skankintoopiv,"Him being a giant lying piece of shit was fine.

ActNo8507,Be interesting to see when he snaps. I would think getting called out everywhere would take its toll.
Findit_Filmit,I don't understand how he can't be sued. How is a politician lying to this degree not a form of illegal fraud? Like lying about ethnicity doesn't effect how they govern but lying about experience and colleges which contributes to the perceived skill of a politician seems ...fraudy?
Embarrassed-Skill749,He has no decency
cmgchamp2,"All this talk of George Santos this, George Santos that.  Okay, the guy's a fraud. I grant you that.

But what everybody is missing is the powerful Republican who put George Santos in place to be where he is today.   

Republican US Rep. Elise Stefanik, from New York no less.

She put his name forward, raised money for him, and campaigned for him.

And today she is part of the US House leadership team.

And Repubs the world over are all now hush-hush about that.   

 Right Repubs?"

GlobalPhreak,"Worth noting:

https://www.cga.ct.gov/PS98/rpt%5Colr%5Chtm/98-R-1540.htm#:~:text=You%20want%20to%20know%20whether,prohibited%20by%20the%20Federal%20Constitution.

""You want to know whether voters in a state can recall a member of the United States Congress.

No, they cannot. Any attempt by a state to recall a member of Congress is prohibited by the Federal Constitution. A vacancy in the office of U.S. senator or representative can be created only by the incumbent's death or resignation, the expiration of his term, or some direct action of the body (the Senate or the House of Representatives) which is empowered to expel members (Burton v. U.S. 202 US 344, at 369).

There is no constitutional authority to hold a special election that would be required to fill a seat in the event a member was recalled. Article I, section 4 of the Federal Constitution relating to the time for holding a regular election and Article XVII of the Amendments on holding a special election only when a vacancy exists combine to preclude an election to replace a member of Congress who had been recalled. Federal constitutional provisions supersede any state recall procedures for these offices.

The details of the argument are included in the attached Brief on the Constitutionality of the Recall of United States Senators and Representatives In Congress, prepared by Hon. Walter F. George, Chairman of the Committee on Privileges and Elections, United States Senate, on May 18, 1935.

Etherius,"I appreciate that /r/politics wants this guy gone

Here’s the problem though.  NY doesn’t appear to have any laws allowing them to recall members of their congressional delegations.

He’s already shown he lacks the integrity to tell the truth, much less do the right thing if it isn’t self-serving to him him

Lastly, y’all are nuts if you think he won’t run again next year and (assuming he isn’t primaried) win.

Weekly_Childhood_274,These idiots should stop voting for frauds and scumbags.
Dasnoosnoo,"The NY post wrote the book on being 'Truth Challenged' so not surprised pathological liar is barred from use.

I suspect Santos is an agent of Russia with goals to continue the state-spnsored effort to degredate American politics and continue to lower the bar. Check out his campaign finance investigation where he originally claimed to be broke, then suddenly had 700k to fund his campaign. The agent theory is  more based then the average Santos bullshit tale."

Two ways to get him out: ⅔ of the House voting him out, or his resigning because he can get a better deal elsewhere. No way is the House gonna open that Constitutional can of worms with expulsion for fear of that tool being used on themselves down the road. 

Given that his cover as a con-man is blown forever and he can’t grift anywhere else now, neither will happen unless the GOP essentially pays him off big-time to resign and retire. He has no skeletons left for the party to expose and force him to go."
