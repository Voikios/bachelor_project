JediTigger,You mean they intend to uphold the Constitution?
Timpa87,a bunch are already in office.
BlueCollarBeagle,"According to conservatives I have met on reddit, there was no insurrection, just a peaceful protest where individuals went inside the Capitol to take selfies, and a few bad apples went too far - but nothing compared to BLM and the left.."
IWantOneSpatula,So a bunch of Congress is just gonna get fired one afternoon?
docter_actual,SCOTUS is gonna be like “thats unconstitutional” even though its literally explicitly in the constitution that thats already a rule
Worried-Boot-1508,">Democratic lawmakers in a handful of states are trying to send a message two years after the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol: Those who engage in an attempted overthrow of the government shouldn’t be allowed to run it.  
>  
>New York, Connecticut and Virginia are among states where proposed legislation would prohibit anyone convicted of participating in an insurrection from holding public office or a position of public trust, such as becoming a police officer.  
>  
>While the bills vary in scope, their aim is similar.  
>  
>“If you’ve tried to take down our government through violent means, in no way should you be part of it,” New York state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal said. He is sponsoring a bill that would bar people convicted of engaging in an insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding civil office, meaning they would not be able to serve as a judge or member of the Legislature. Hoylman-Sigal said he introduced the bill this year because he saw more people who were involved in the riot in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, running for office last year...  
>  
>The legislation in the states comes after the House Jan. 6 committee’s final report, which found Donald Trump criminally engaged in a conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election he lost and failed to take action to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol.  
>  
>The committee’s recently concluded work may have provided another springboard for lawmakers to act and propose ways to hold people accountable, said Victoria Bassetti, a senior policy adviser at States United Democracy Center...  
>  
>The legislation is another example of how the Capitol riot has become a political Rorschach test in the country ... Even students are being taught different versions of the attack, depending on whether they live in more conservative or liberal parts of the nation. The opposing realities came into sharp focus this month in Pennsylvania during a fraught exchange between two lawmakers.  
>  
>In a committee hearing, Republican state Sen. Cris Dush slammed his gavel as he ruled Democratic state Sen. Amanda Cappelletti out of order after she described the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as “the site of an insurrection.”  
>  
>“Insurrection, nobody has been charged with that,” Dush said. “There’s not been a single charge against any of those people as insurrectionists. In this committee, we are not using that term.”  
>  
>Nearly 1,000 people have been charged in the Capitol riot with federal crimes, with about half of them pleading guilty to riot-related charges and more than three dozen convicted at trial. The charges range from misdemeanors for those accused of entering the Capitol illegally but not participating in violence to felony seditious conspiracy for far-right extremist group members accused of plotting to stop the transfer of presidential power...  
>  
>Cappelletti told The Associated Press that it’s important to make sure people understand that the attack on the Capitol was an insurrection. “These are factually correct things,” she said. “That doesn’t mean that we can’t disagree politically about policy or other things, but we can acknowledge that that happened and start to figure out how we move forward to work together to build up that public trust again.”  
>  
>Dush remained steadfast in his view that what unfolded on Jan. 6 was not an insurrection. “If there had been some sort of plot for an insurrection, that would’ve come apart quite quickly after the government got the control back,” he said in a phone interview..."
Earptastic,Was there a recent insurrection? Oh that one a few years ago. What the fuck is taking so long?
a-really-cool-potato,"They *are* barred and *can* be removed from office, you just can’t be a coward"

,[removed]
memberjan6,"It's already a federal code or written in the law to kick and ban from government office of any kind, any person who committed insurrection. Just follow the rules is all that is needed. Additional law making is not helpful.

 But additional administration of justice is strongly needed here."
YOURESTUCKHERE,This should have been done two years ago.
Up_words,Donald Trump attempted an insurrection on American soil - even tried to have his VP killed - and he's the leading GOP candidate for president. I hate this fcking country.
Burgerpocolypse,That means fuck all if they can’t go after the insurrectionists that are already holding office.

itsalloverfolks007,"Just a thought, but maybe they could start by enforcing the current laws?

https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-1999-title18-section2383&num=0&edition=1999

> §2383. Rebellion or insurrection
Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.

Why is Trump even allowed to run for office? Do our laws mean nothing?

The failure to enforce the current maximum penalty for the Jan 6 insurrection on everyone involved is sending a very clear message to those who wish to dismantle our democracy."
User767676,"They are already barred given the 14 the amendment. Practically though, who technically tells someone they are disqualified? Some state or federal election office early or at the swearing in at the last moment?"
turbo_danish,Does that include the ones already holding office?
MidlifeChrysalis-999,If they’re going to bar felons from voting then they should be barred from holding office.

TheBigPhilbowski,Doesn't the constitution do that anywhere? Check the bottom... Or maybe it's on the back?
angiebangie5102,does that include “politicians” that support them
firstr100build,Yet MTG is on a homeland security committee.
Impressive-Listen-37,Isn't it already a constitutional amendment ?
Smrleda,Right now we have con artists- liars - criminals - insurrectionists in our congress and the possibility that an ex president who planned an successful insurrection will run again.  How will this law affect all that.
CaptOblivious,"The Constitution is absolutely clear on this. There is no action that needs be taken, they are already disqualified.     

 


https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/section-3/   

>Fourteenth Amendment  Equal Protection and Other Rights

>    Section 3 Disqualification from Holding Office

>No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.

We just have to say No."
kunren,Can we start with putting out the people who are already IN office?
zuzg,How about the spouses from insurrectionists?
VanguardLLC,"And somehow, that’s controversial!?"
GoneFishing4Chicks,"It took two fucking years. America is fucked for the normal Americans, but for the rich, it was another Tuesday couping a government they hate."
BarCompetitive7220,"   I can't wait to hear the supporters of insurrectionist whine and say that is just so ""undemocratic"".    Those legislator's are now saying that overthrowing the government is a good thing and great for democracy.     Those anti- GOP ad almost write themselves - we value party over democracy."
whinny-the-bish,The fact that this policy doesn’t already exist just shows how totally FUBAR’d our political system is.
theketchupvoid,"IF we had originally held to this promise after the Civil War, much of the senseless suffering of many factions of Americans would have been mitigated with Reconstruction. Black leaders who held office in the South wouldn't have lost elections to pardoned Confederates who took back their power after bemoaning their 'Lost Cause'. 

I see no reason as to why these insurrectionists will get a ban, despite all evidence to the contrary. It's just history repeating itself, after all."
JoeOutrage,"My county's newest commissioner, an elected official, is a January 6th insurrectionist."

gigglesworthy,"A disturbing number of commenters here clearly haven't read the article.

This article isn't about the US Congress, for the most part.

The article discusses what some *State* legislatures are doing about *State-level* positions. The bills cover a range of positions such as police, judge, municipal jobs."
buzzedewok,It’s more disturbing that people would actually vote for them.
Aquarian8491,"These confederate traitors should be charged , tried and dealt with immediately ."
Sufficient_Matter_37,First will need to remove the ones currently holding office
driftwoodbotis,Good! So Trump can’t run again?

bunkscudda,"It’s absurd to me that you can declare war on a government, and then still be allowed to be part of and influence that government. It’s like allowing an ISIS leader to hold office in the US."

Sad_Literature_8657,Here’s looking at you Jim Jordan.
Ellen1957,"We need to get rid of the ones that are currently in Congress and the Senate too. Anyone who asked for a pardon for January 6th, should not be in public office. They knew what they were doing was illegal as a pardon is an admission of guilt."
geneticeffects,"Disappointed they are receiving such light sentences, honestly. I would have thought trying to overthrow a government would mean life in prison or death."
75w90,Mtg is on Homeland security committee. I think it's safe to say we are and have been fucked.
LAESanford,"It’s beyond all reasonable belief that official action has to be taken to prevent someone who *who acted to overthrow the government* from holding an elected office. 
  I wonder where the bar is? There were 147 Republican Congress members who voted to reject the results of a valid presidential election who continued to serve as legislators. They should have been barred. Some of those legislators were planners, instigators, enablers, providing funding and logistical support. Not one has faced any real consequences"
amcfarla,I thought there was an amendment that already did that.
Olds78,"Not sure why there is even a question about someone that tried to overthrow the government then becoming a part of said government. I feel like that should just be standard and neither MGT, Bobert, Jordan or any of the other scum bags should be in office still"
PMmeurdixout4harambe,So half of our government is getting gutted?

Sutarmekeg,Should also consider barring them with metal bars in some sort of detention facility.
chaotica78,"Why is there always pushback? This should be a common ground. This should go without saying, but they're still fighting it.

HopefullyMD_PhD,Won’t work. A lot of them already in office.
ExPatWharfRat,"If you want them barred from holding office for participating in an insurrection, you only need to charge and convict them accordingly. Take the gloves off and start swinging or STFU.

shadowdra126,And what about the ones in office?
Lunalagatita,Let me guess: republicans won’t be on board with this.
GrnPlesioth,About freaking time
liililllllliilillill,Being someone who was tried and convicted for crimes committed at the Capitol on Jan. 6 is about to be very respectable among Republicans. Republicans LOVE right wingers who wield violence. There will definitely be seditionists that will run for office in the future. They need to be barred.

UCanArtifUWant2,Does this include members of the House and Senate who voted to overturn the election without due cause?
rgc6075k,"I understand the spirit and intent of these efforts however, I believe this is the wrong approach.  It seems to be the natural approach to problem solving for many humans to try and add a solution, in this case add more laws to the many volumes of laws we already have.  I prefer to strip things away to find cause rather than treat symptoms.  We need to enforce the laws we already have and at the same time ask what the motivators of these negative behaviors are.  Maybe this seems a more complicated approach but, I really don't think adding complication (laws) that requires multitudes of lawyers, court battles, and reams of paper in all its forms (paper & electronic) to semi-resolve or decipher is the answer.  More laws just equates to more big business law and politics.  Yuck!"
GuaranteeCreative954,Should be that way in Washington DC too but here we are and DOJ seems to be ignoring it all!
Ratb33,"What in the fuck. It’s been two years and literally nothing has happened to these congress members that obviously had a part in it.

fireemblemsonya,We should all be pushing Dem lawmakers to do this NOW. Unless we wanna end up like Israel in a year when Clarence Thomas decides to have another bad poopy diaper day. People don't seem to realize the danger we're in just because we (sort of) won the Senate.

Protonbox22,"Only 2 years too late and knowing it will fail with a republican majority in the house........oh no hey folks we tried only after knowing it would fail, darn, shucks! Keep blindly supporting us and be 100% loyal accusing anyone who criticizes us as BoTh SidEs even when we blatantly fuck you and the people you care about. We aren't gonna do anything about trump, the republican seditionists behind j6, white collar crime, climate change, police murdering people, anything! We will make it seem like we are gonna do something but we won't, no the rich and powerful dont go to prison because we might end up there too!

Seriously you can't excuse the government for not living up to its primary functions to keep civilians safe from the enemies of the United States foreign and domestic. Secondly government must maintain the stability of the country at large and allowing 100% confirmed seditionists keep their positions of power is going to create instability. The republican followers are more radicalized than ever and feel vindicated that their seditionists politicians have evaded the law this long. We will all suffer for the weakness of this government but not just you the people you care about too."
gentleman_bronco,"Republican counterargument to barring insurrectionists and traitors to public office: well if we bar every insurrectionist and traitor, we'd have nothing left! Now, can we get back to what's truly plaguing this country? People who aren't adhering to our definition of gender."

Seriously, thanks for the moral outrage while accomplishing nothing."
,"A little late if you ask me. Ffs, Democrats accomplished basically nothing when it comes to protecting the country from republican terrorism and holding them accountable for all that they did under trump. Besides the change to the electoral vote count, I'd argue that we are even more vulnerable today, largely because of Democrats inaction. So well done, Democrats. Glad you were able to break that rail workers strike instead of upholding your oath to the constitution you bunch of spineless assholes."

snorlax9001,Insurrectionist will be defined by who ever is in power. Sure to end well.
acausalchaos,How's that gonna work when the insurrectionists have a majority?
D_-_G,Isn’t this already in the legal code? Trying to overthrow the government to install your own policies and form of government is treason. You cannot be elected if you’re a participant in any form of treason. I’d recommend a much much harsher penalty. But how is this not table-stakes?
DrDraek,Maybe don't wait until insurrectionists take over Congress before trying to do this?

,">Those who engage in an attempted overthrow of the government shouldn’t be allowed to run it.

Hey guys!

This isn’t just an attempt to stop the January 6th MAGA rioters from ever holding public office. If you’re a far leftist that wants to overthrow the corporate oligarchy which actually controls the U.S. government, decides who wins the big elections, and controls which policies are voted on by your bought-and paid-for government officials; then this law would also apply to you too.

What we are witnessing here is the beginning of mask-off capitalism and fascism rearing their ugly heads here in the U.S.A."
SilvDeVill,With that logic someone like Nelson Mandela would have never gotten a chance to hold office in SA. A crime is a crime depending on who is holding office. That is what decides which side of the law you are on.
