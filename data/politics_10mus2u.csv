epistaxis64,Man this would be the absolute best outside of taking away their tax exempt status.
The_Navy_Sox,"Before anyone gets mad they are saying if we are banning kids from drag shows, they should be banned from church which is a place where kids have been sexually assaulted many times, unlike drag shows. It's more tongue in cheek than anything.

It also makes the point of some verses in the bible being adult content that is not suitable for children, so it should be kept from kids the same way books are being removed from schools that have gay or trans characters.

This is not an attack on religion, but showing how ridiculous these bans on other things are."
thistimelineisweird,Drag performers could register a non-profit church the way John Oliver did. Now it is about religious freedom.
Clownsinmypantz,"Considering the amount of people raised with religious trauma, make religion for adults. Give an adult the choice on what to believe in, not terrifying a child and restrict their life because of your own views."
BetterUrbanDesign,"I mean the GOP should love this. They seem super concerned about people indoctrinating kids into harmful ideologies, after all."
Several_Prior3344,What if I told you that a core feature of churches is to indoctrinate children as early as possible?
PleasantWay7,">	“a lot of nudity, a lot of sex, a lot of things” goes down at drag shows.

Man, I must be going to the wrong drag shows, I mever had that much fun."
liberal_texan,"Religions are like penises. It’s ok to have them, and it’s fine to be proud of them. But please don’t go waving them around in public and sure as hell don’t force them on a child. 

I support this 1000%."
shelrayray,"In Catholic Churches men wear dresses, standing up in front of children telling them about murder, blood rituals and torture. They allow minors to drink alcohol. And don’t even get me started on what goes on behind closed doors. That’s far more dangerous than anything I’ve ever seen even at an adult centered drag show…"
NotmyRealNameJohn,Full background checks for all priests or other church workers who will in any way work with children
synchrohighway,"Just between conversion therapy and rapist priests, churches are one of the worst places to send children to."
datokaa,I mean how is it even a debate nowadays? It really shouldn't be.
TheGhostOfKyle,I’ve been saying this since Colorado Springs.  The right is so concerned about grooming why aren’t they storming churches the way they do LGBT events.  More priests get arrested on a weekly basis for sexual abuse than any drag queen has.  It’s about homophobia plain and simple.
Complcatedcoffee,"I sincerely wish that drag shows are half as raucous as the Facists claim they are. I’ve been to hundreds of them, at adult venues, in multiple states over decades. Just some lip syncing and corny jokes by men wearing makeup better than I’ve ever come close to applying it and a few kings looking extra sharp in fake goatees. I enjoy drag shows, but they’re some of the tamest events I’ve ever been to. Really quite creative and wholesome."
hologramheavy,"My kids will know better than to go anywhere near a church, you know because of all the molesting"
NJ_Mets_Fan,How quick religion would die if it was a choice you made as an adult vs being brain washed as a child and looked down on or lose your family if you decide maybe you dont want to think the way they want you to think?
Jaambie,But then how do you brainwash and indoctrinate?  Gotta start on that when they’re young.
Q_OANN,The purpose of this whole movement by the right has been to muddy the waters. The main players like libs of TikTok never respond to the weekly arrests or charges against conservatives. They never try and shut down church services where this happens every week.
GeorgeIsGettinAngry,"Yea kids don’t need to be lied to or molested etc. So yea, go fuck your own life up adults! (Go get molested by a Priest!) Although they seem to prefer little boys so yea, fuck religion."

& while we're at it, tax 'em."
Present_Crew_713,"A 1,000 year old cult."
the-hottest-of-damns,Agreed. Anyone getting mad about it? Feel like it violates your freedom? Well this time it actually will protect children. Think. Of. The. Children.
Farty_Nonsense,"Church is not safe for kids and the Bible is full of horrible shit, why do we keep letting the church groom and rape our kids, AND without paying taxes. Churches get bigger and preacher has a really nice car, but there always seems to be more and more homeless people begging for money on the corner of the street by our local mega churches. Seems wrong. Almost like they’re shitty institutions full of liars and hypocrites."
maxstep,"All churches right, of any faith? I agree with *that* but only if it's *all* faiths"

lnin0,but how would we groom our kids if not allowed to use the churches anymore?
29kez84,Let’s tax them.
novad80,Then how would we indoctrinate the children?
Utterlybored,But how else will they find out they were born in sin?
Newguyiswinning_,But then how will they be brainwashed?
user_x9000,Better hill to die on: make churches and religions taxable.
cheap90scigar,"> in 2019, the Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News started reporting on sex abuse in Southern Baptist churches; a 2022 third-party report highlighted how the Southern Baptist Convention, like the Roman Catholic Church, had been hushing up cases of such abuse for years and years.


The Catholic church should be taxed up to their tits and the money should go to adequately funding child protective services."
thewhitedeath,"Religion would be completely and utterly destroyed were people actually old enough to think critically about it before being exposed to it.

I support this 100 percent."
lizzy_bee333,I went down a rabbit hole today reading articles about parents abusing and killing their children while “performing exorcisms.” The future of Christianity is *very*  concerning to me.
Gaytaino,Just go to this sub r/pastorarrested and you’ll see why it should be only adults.
Dr_Tacopus,Then how would the church indoctrinate all the kids?
snafu607,Cathloic priests are not going to want this and will fight it.
dillpick15,I am very much so in favor of this
billthecougarnut,"That will never happen because it is exponentially harder indoctrinate adults into religion than children, and the church know it."
mikeorhizzae,No way would it survive without indoctrinating (grooming) youth to believe their bullhonkey
Javasndphotoclicks,Trillion dollar pyramid scam.
VigorouslySoft,It’s the tax exemption that needs to be removed as well.
please_squish_me,Yes.
IsGoingTTaM,This and tax the church!
sodiumbicarbonade,Should have a kidstoo movement where people kick out all pedos pretending to be priests
SoWokeIdontSleep,"100% agreed, the religious have proven time and again they cannot be trusted with minors."
,This. Is. The. Way.
BarryKobama,Priests & money-grubbing churches are the problem. Putting themselves between believers & god. And touching kids.
TessaQuayle,I've been saying this for *years*.
amiatthetop3,Would be nice to have more political candidates that are unaffiliated to religion.
EmotionalAd5920,lets outlaw them entirely. crazy people doing silly things even at their most innocent
DisastrousHawk835,Yeah but then how would the church indoctrinate?
Kryptosis,Lmao then no one would go. They depend on getting kids religious early so it sticks.
Equivalent-Excuse-80,Who would the priests rape?
tayfbear,The whole point of churches is to get children indoctrinated young so that when they grow up and open their eyes through education they won’t question the ridiculousness of the stories they’ve been fed.
flatdanny,Churches are grooming children into their death cult.
SaintedRomaine,Then how will they sell mythic fairy tales to the next generation?
justalongd,Or how about we just evolve as a species and abandon the archaic worship of fiction?
Monsi_ggnore,Let’s keep religion out of their lives until they’re old enough to think for themselves. That should solve the entire issue within 2 generations.
arrze,Except the whole brainwashing children from an early age is the only way to retain their membership…. this would effectively kill religion.
mecko2123,*All the clergymen suddenly switch jobs to weekend babysitters.*
Pure_Khaos,Would definitely help with the child diddling problem
AltoidStrong,All cults and there club houses should be 21+.
Kolob_Hikes,"If kids got raped by clowns as often as they get raped by priests it would be against the law to take your kids to the circus. 

- Dan Savage"
gulfpapa99,"End religious indoctrination of children Children should be taught how to think, not what to think."
Diobolic_Gumption168,I feel like a child growing up being told they can’t come with their parents to church would ultimately make them want to go to church
58fwm,Let’s just make churches pay taxes
right_bank_cafe,Stop grooming and indoctrinating our children! Lol
mattman0000,"Good luck with that.  If you don’t indoctrinate them when they’re young, they may develop independent thought and free will."
BountyHunterSAx,"Ngl, I was not expecting to agree with this. But the argument is VERY convincing. Adult supervision required makes sense"
ignore_this_comment,/r/PastorArrested
PJMurphy,"Religion is like circumcision.  

If you wait until people are adults to introduce the concept, it's unlikely to be enthusiastically received."
Ari76L,"Wow I can’t believe I never thought of that. Kids are susceptible to being brainwashed she’s being taken advantage of. I’ll never push religion onto my kids, I told them when they’re adults they can decide for themselves."
mahnamahna27,How about making religion adults only? Let children grow up free from indoctrination then let them decide as an adult if they want to follow a religion (of their own choosing). Imagine that world.
IWasGregInTokyo,Japan just ruled that forcing children to participate in religious/cult activities is child abuse.  This stems from the actions of the (ex) Unification Church which led to Abe's killing.
Acceptable_Wall4085,It’s not going to happen. If anyone told an adult that Adam and Eve had two male kids and the rest of humanity was supposedly from that family there wouldn’t be anyone believing that line of horse shit. Children are so gullible that they’ll believe anything. The only difference between children’s fairy tale books and the bible are the words Once Upon a Time.
Important_Outcome_67,"Well, considering what's in the Old Testament, seems to make sense to me."
fsactual,Can you imagine if drag queens with assault rifles showed up at youth services to ensure the kids are safe?
,[removed]
obolobolobo,"it would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad. Religion is the dictionary definition of indoctrination. What mental gymnastics do people like De Santis undertake to square this circle? 

Sit down Jim, I said mental. No pants to sniff here."
xclame,">he quoted at length from an ostensible communique he received from a drag queen, begging him to protect Arkansas’s children and assuring him that “a lot of nudity, a lot of sex, a lot of things” goes down at drag shows.


Yeah, fucking right. Get the fuck out of here with this bullshit. While there might be SOME nudity backstage while people get changed into different outfits, there's no more nudity then say at a Miss Universe pageant. Same shit with Sex, while I'm sure some people engage in sex around these events, it's not like these people are going around and having sex ""in public"". The ""dangers"" to children at these shows is no different then at any pageant or modeling event, the only difference here is people dressing up as a different sex than they are, (Which let's be honest, is actually what these people are scared about.)


But on to the title of the article, I'm all for it, in fact I think religion as a whole should be 18+. Give these kids at least a chance to be able to make up their own mind on what to believe and on how they are supposed to treat ""others"" , instead of being forced to believe and behave a certain way by their parents."
Honor_Sprenn,If you let the kids grow up outside the cult they won’t join though…
Strange-Evening1491,Got a point there. It's kinda like you have to be an adult to believe in Santa Claus.
returningtheday,Honestly something I completely agree with. Raised Catholic and hate that I was. Religion should be something one finds not forced upon you cause of who gave birth to you.
sodomystic,Agreed.
JohnnyPantySeed,"Very interesting idea, but it ruins the fun of being stuck on a wooden bench for an hour or more listening to some douchebag hint at imaginary solutions to very real problems encountered by adults."
Triple_Fart_Zero,"Or stop protecting, helping, funding, and condoning pedophiles. This has been going on for thousands of years and it’s one of the most atrocious things any group of humans has ever done, much less a group that is supposed to be a beacon of good for humanity. For me it solidifies my atheism because there is no way the god they preach about would be ok with this. Forgiveness or not."
Nomanslav,200%
JojenCopyPaste,Adult-only churches? I'm gonna make my own church! With blackjack and hookers!
Damoclese420,We have to stop the priests from raping kids.
plsobeytrafficlights,I think religion should be 21 and over anyways.
GuaranteeCreative954,Agree
CactiiAnus,Nice. Especially since a lot of these churches have daycare / schooling that parents drop their kids off for.  Can you imagine?
Gay_Lord2020,Where was this when I was a kid
michaelfkenedy,"What that saying? Religion is like a penis, you can be proud of it, but:

- you should not show it in public
- you should not force it on others
- you should not show it to children"
themanfromvulcan,Im not quite sure this satire is being recognized as satire.
agnicho,And put an end to non-secular schooling.
phiz36, But then eventually no one would believe. Gasp.
packetgeeknet,Or abolish churches all together.
cosmicannoli,"I say this without being flippant or condescending:

Teaching religion to children is indoctrination, and that's by design.

I think it's a reasonable argument to say ""Well we have to teach it to them when they're young, because that faith has to be instilled as early as possible""

But to the rest of us, that's a problem, and it demonstrates that, if you don't indoctrinate them as children, odds are they will grow up and decide they don't need that faith.

Many still will, but the religious population in the world would fall like a rock.

Ultimately this will happen anyway. Religion in general is on borrowed time. 

But as an atheist, I can't say I believe that there aren't many people who genuinely live better lives because of their religion.

The \*singular\* problem I have with religion is the dogma, specifically dogma that requires you to enforce your faith's ideas or ideals onto others, or generally any sort of doctrine of control over others. That's such a blatantly dangerous and obviously malignant thing, that it's infuriating.

Religion in a technology. It's one of the earliest forms of social engineering. A way for people in power to incentivize people out of power to act in a pro-social way in spite of existential pressures that would compel them to act anti-socially.

I do not believe that anyone in truly high levels of power and control is genuine in their faith."
cosminstef92,"Who wants to see a reaction from ma’ top G, Kenneth Copeland?"
Outrageous_Ear_6091,Yes ! This is a brilliant idea
tony_sandlin,But how to indoctrinate the children then? 🤔
AngryBudgie13,"Would have been easier than me me getting “sick” all the time so I could stay home and watch Star Trek reruns. 

Also cheaper than all the therapy I needed after leaving the abusive hell hole that was the evangelical church when I turned 18z"
EdJamic8,To protect all humanity let’s ban religion
EvilGypsyQueen,This wins the internet today! Best post I have read.
lunaflect,"Without children, they’d have no members. The kids are being raised up to tithe. And FREE vacation Bible school is doing the recruitment"
greaghttwe,"Agree, and pretty much any other religious places like mosque."
MULTFOREST,"I agree with this. About a year ago, my sister was like, ""I'm feeling kind of isolated, and I'm thinking of joining a local church, but I need a babysitter for my kids, because I'm not going to put them at risk."""
chockedup,"Yes, religion should be adults only, but I doubt Gov. Sanders would agree."
DevIsSoHard,"They should be, they serve alcohol? Doesn't seem like you should do that at a kid friendly spot"
Dasha_nekrasova_FAS,As long as shuls are included as well. The orthodox community has a major issue with child sexual abuse.
fractal_pudding,probably the best idea since humans evolved vocalcords.
Dawni49,"In agreement, I suffered more harm at church as a child and thoroughly enjoyed the drag show I and my two year old son attended at an event as and adult"
,[removed]
351tips,If it’s that dangerous maybe they have to be abolished
staceythefavorite,"Yes.  My ex was taking my 2 year old son to bahai church gatherings, I didn't think it could get any worse but  now he said he switched religions to latter day saints.  I tried to fight it in court but the judge allowed him to take him to ""worship"" , I'll be fighting the latter day saints issue again though, and bringing up that he switched and will be confusing the boy with his nonsense."
continuousQ,"Regardless of other issues, children should be free to grow up to choose their own religion if any.

There should be no religious schools for children, and no religious hospitals for anyone who needs to go to a hospital and won't have the privilege to choose from a wide variety of institutions. And there shouldn't be any recreational activities for children where they're segregated by faith. If you want faith to be the deciding factor, be an adult, with adults."
biskitheadburl,It defies comprehension why any church member would allow their children anywhere near the clergy with their 2000 year history of child sexual predation.
Dancypants72,"I agree, church is not for kids. Completely inappropriate. I would take my child to a drag show, but not to church."
Ulysses698,That's against the First Amendment my dude.
AngryManBoy,Do it to Mosques as well. Let’s see how well that goes
CaPtAiN_KiDd,"I would leave my kid alone with a Drag Queen, I can’t say the same for a priest."
dontdropthesope1,I’m good with banning churches altogether 😄
TenebrisEquus,This would never work because the parents would just indoctrinate their kids.  The system has been running for a long time and it would be nearly impossible to change or eliminate it.
APirateAndAJedi,That protects them in more ways than one
satanicmajesty,"If you don’t start telling them these incredible stories as impressionable kids, not many average-intelligence adults will believe bullshit stories about prophets, demi-gods, magic, virgins, and eternal life or reincarnation."
liililllllliilillill,"It would be so easy to fearmonger about churches if they weren’t seen as the “default” house of worship for the “default” faith in the US.

Children are being raped in churches, and they are being told grotesque stories by cult leaders. Many of them “eat flesh” and “drink blood” in their rituals according to their “sacred scripture” whick they call the “bib lay”. Why look here, it says they’re allowed to keep human slaves right here."
LLColdAssHonkey,How about we classify churches as hate groups?
DavidGlennCox,I was reading Mark Twain and he pointed out something I had never thought of. He maintained that God was unfair to punish Adam. Because Adam did know about right or wrong until after he ate the apple. He couldn't know it was wrong until he'd done it. He also mused if God created all the animals in one day. Why build an ark? Why not just recreate the animals after the flood? Or even more miraculously let the animals swim!

ArchdukeAlex8,"Children will always be influenced by something. How are we to determine which processes are brainwashing and which are socializing? Can we use something other than our own biases to make that determination?

I am not here to pick sides, but I ask that everyone consider WHY they have taken their positions."
oldmancornelious,Fuck churches. Talk about child molestation and indoctrination. Fucking groomers.
No_Bumblebee_285,"I’m a Christian. This is fair. It should be adults only. People are too weird now to trust them for an hour with your kid. Regardless, the message is broken and it’s more about obedience and indoctrination than Jesus or The Bible. Most Christian’s in any church have no idea what The Bible says or means. It truly is sad. So much available and most have no clue."
LouDog187,"If you can't vote til you're 18, why do you have to worship from the time you're able to read?"
excusetheblood,"I know people have a problem with this take but as a religious trauma survivor, I fully believe that it is child abuse to raise a child in an organized religion"
thatblbc,Or make them pay taxes
FreezeFrameEnding,"It's how it should be. It's abusive to indoctrinate children as they simply are not old enough to understand or consent. Not that understanding or consent are important in any church, and that's why rules like this need to be put in place. They want drag shows to be cancelled yet churches are far more dangerous."
SnazzyStooge,"…and that, children, is how religion came to an end forever."
BronxBoy56,"And while you are at it, make them pay taxes."
samanthrax314,Great idea!!
QuintinStone,"Sending kids to church is a form of indoctrination, which conservatives claim to hate."
ExternalFar7953,To protect children we should get rid of all churches
JohnWulf06,It is funny how those who complain the loudest about indoctrination are the ones who do it to everyone they can get away with from birth!
internetbrowser23,Organized religion is where all the problems start tbh. Personal faith can be good and helpful to people. Its when people gather together to prove their faith to each other that starts ruining things.
Ok-Ease7090,All religion is mass delusion. It should be criminalized as the scam that it is.
CosmoTroy1,Good Idea.  I was raised Catholic and went to parochial schools.  Was exposed to tons of violent imagery as a child  (crown of thorns)- and then when you thought it couldn't get worse they shove you into a dark box to tell some opaque man what you've done wrong.  Total Bullshit!!
Ok-Efficiency-3694,"Cool. Make sure churches also cannot be within 50 miles of a school, residential area, or anywhere else children may regularly be active while at it."
jeffinRTP,What prevents Christian grooming?
Morial,"I dig it. We currently proselytize our youth. If most kids were not forced to church by their parents, most would be nonreligious."
huhIguess,Oops. There goes every adoption agency in the US.
Caddywumpus,Let’s make churches *tax-paying* adults-only venues.
Tyndael87,"I agree.

The only reason religion keeps propogating is because adults take children who lack critical thinking abilities to believe in a thing that no one can prove, all on ""faith"".

Religion has single handedly been one of the leading causes of human misery."
Jerkofalljerks,Brilliant!
mixturebill,How about we get rid of churches altogether?
ripcovidiots,"You'd think the right would be all about this, considering how much they crow about child groomers. There's things in religious texts that they'd lose their fucking minds about if they were on SpongeBob, but something tells me that they are going to be ok with allowing children to continue being indoctrinated into abusive cults that have no basis in reality. 

Them fuckin' drag queens, though.."
SuperAleste,Let's get rid of them completely
sevotlaga,Absolutely! No church for impressionable minds!
Captain_CatDad,Tax them first
cody4king,But then they’ll miss prime brainwashing years.
amithatfarleft,Wouldn’t want their impressionable young minds to get indoctrinated after all
GrumpyCatDoge99,I actually wouldn’t be against this
Dr-Chris-C,"As an addendum, to protect adults, let's just not have churches"
StandardizedGenie,Amen
DowntimeJEM,And tax em!
jarjarkinks4747,I Fucking love the Arkansas Times for this. Fuck the Gazette and it's racist billionaire owner.
mces97,"I tell this to the ""groomer"" crowd all the time. They get very mad when you point out priests have touched kids a lot more than anyone in the lgtbq community."
Hopfit46,Tax them...theyll close within a year.
TacoS4Me-69-420,"thats pretty fair; most people dont have the intelligence, the maturity, the life experience, or even the self discipline to get any value out of the bible until their about thirty these days anyway, meanwhile  the adults can still use the bible to inform their parenting."
ConsistentLog4353,"Jesus fucking christ. ""thek hildren keep getting molested in church so let's ban them from attending""

Maybe stop the people who work at churches from raping little kids. Or maybe get rid of the whole vile institution altogether."
unverifiable_user,And how about educating people that their religion is a lie.
,[deleted]
PRPLpenumbra,I wonder if the Satanic Temple could get any headway along this track if they pushed for it
dun-ado,A civilized country would ban all churches and label them as cults.
SkyriderRJM,Yeah that isn’t viable.  Idea is pretty dumb and it’ll be laughed out of court if attempted.
paulfromatlanta,"This would immediately be ruled unconstitutional, whether the judge was liberal or conservative."
HistoricalBand1,"As an atheist, that might be the dumbest/most naive suggestion I’ve encountered. How about we make schools and any other place children have been harmed adults-only as well?"
SweetPeaPotato,Could you imagine the outrage if this was arguing about banning children from Mosques or Synagogues? Stop shitting on Catholics cause they’re an easy target.
BagOnuts,How is this “politics”?
StrangerFew2424,"Amen. At the very least, no children should be allowed there without their parents."
yourmothersgun,If CRT is such a big problem they certainly should not be teaching children anything from religion.
Mach12gamer,"Oh look, an article obviously written to be controversial and start arguments. I wonder how many people fell for it."
Redditthedog,“Congress shall make no law” This would be unconstitutional
cool_name52,Reddit moment
DropsTheMic,Separation of church and state goes both ways. You also can't have the state legislating how people raise their kids or what beliefs they pass on. You're opening Pandora's box even publishing this nonsense. You realize that if you tried to pass this Idiocracy then the same laws would apply in reverse in areas all around the country? The resulting conflict would be an ideological war between groups with kids as collateral damage.
Imaginary_Kangaroo80,Not religious but I could support this.
brokenB42morrow,"Never going to happen. 
No kids, no indoctrination."
femalevideographer,"The church would die out within a generation, I can guarantee"
PepeSylvia11,"That is an incredible idea. It'll never happen (or be enforced), but still. Every child is born agnostic. It's their family that instills within them the religion (or lack thereof) that they want them to follow.

This would help people to make their own choices, rather than being forced."
notconvinced3,"To protect the kids, religion needs to stop stigmatizing sex and relationships outside of  hetero marriage standards. The religious figures should be allowed to date and have consentual physical relationships with other adults. 
Find actual, safe and consentual outless for their repressed needs. 

Gah, I hate religion"
Fragrant-Astronaut57,Any kid that’s actually paying attention in mass is a red flag anyways
Entire-Horror-6409,"Catholic church be like “all priests AND higher level rule makers in the church will be unmarried, celebate men. They will have zero healthy outlet for any sexual drives, because even sex with one’s self is immoral. This will definitely not attract weirdos or have any unintended consequences or abuses of power.”"
Schiffy94,What kind of name is Stubblefield anyway
Many_Working_6126,"Ok but, how the fuck are you gonna enforce this? Tell kids they can’t go to church? That’s gonna bode well with the hyper-conservative Christian base. Gtfo here."
YourKidSaysTheNWord,Banning children from religion will only entice them more.
chasesan,Can we also do this to most restaurants?
Straddle_E_Do,Make churches extinct
