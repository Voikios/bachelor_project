CivEng32,This is like a horror movie...
ShermanatorYT,"From a visual and gameplay perspective Id love to play more Streets, but the rubber banding is insane"

heathy28,"PlAyAbLe, most of my raids on streets are like this I think out of 30-40 raids only 1-2 were fine and not rubberbanding. I did a whole bunch of runs last night naked and just ran straight to the missions. I won't take a single piece of gear into this map until it stops doing this. I did manage to get to broadcast 4, I still need room 215 and another room somewhere but after a bunch of games I was able to brute force it and extract a couple times.

it reminds me of when I started playing back in 0.5 or 0.6, entire games would be desynced and you would just randomly die when it caught up with itself, scavs just sitting there complete desynced. taking 50 buckshots to the face. then turning around and one tapping you. ahh it brings me back."
noobgiraffe,"3 streets raids in a row I can't play because of atrocious rubber banding. I try to hide until it passes and typicaly just get death screen without hearing or seeing being killed.

This happens on streets only. I wouldn't touch this map until they fix it but how am I supposed to do quests on it."
TastyBeefJerkey,"Woods?

That's honestly terrible, even getting teleported away, they might fix it one day."
chuck_stones,Unbelievably disappointed that he didn't load back in then 1-tap you head/eyes.
DunamisBlack,"Yeah I'm not playing streets this wipe, maybe on down the road if my friends report a big improvement but IDC how much loot is there, I'm not subjecting my freetime to this type of frustration and bullshit. I've gotten Kappa enough times, I can just enjoy the functional part of the game now without worrying about missing out on endgame stuff that is gated behind 45 FPS rubberband fuckfests"
BaseballElectrical55,It was a dream

snoozieboi,"I've had this on interchange, but he stood still and just looked like an afk guy. 

You can imagine my rat senses were tingling, 20 shots later from 20 yards away I seriously was wondering what ammo changes Nikita had done. I then proceeded with the  stabby knife and understood this was a new feature to the bug and crawled back into the dark."
ADerivative,The teleport at the end really had me
ZainSenjab,"Oh yeah bro factory, love that map"
WoodeusPrime,Anyone know how many of the streets quests are kappa related?
GaCoRi,woods
beagleactiveprobe,I was waiting for him to just spray you down while you tried to hatch him to death.
Bnasty909,Call me crazy but I feel melee should get buffed it takes way too many swings to kill a person
SHTIFFee,My work computer starting stuttering after watching this.
,"Had this happen to me on streets. Shot the guy 38 times. He turned and killed me and on the death screen I had zero hits.

Yes I tried the legs."
2B_LEWD_BUTT,"I gave up playing in Streets, I'm in NA East, and every single fucking game (scav or PMC) lags for the first 10 or even 20 minutes."
SovietCyka,"Don't get greedy, just shoot him and move on. Also the teleporting is obviously a feature, not a bug"
Ok_Shop_3418,This game is so fucked lol
majorbeefy130130,And they want twice as many players on this map when it's finished lmao
iljuha_sewar,The same happened to my friend. This happens when a player runs and suddenly disconnects from the game (in our case my friend's game crashed). His character was exactly like in OP's video. Would be nice if they made the character stop when the player disconnects since he makes so much noise and is easily heard from far away.
frakist,Starts at streets ends in interchange i guess. Nice teleport.
FeroxSpeedruns,You suck at this game!
TheMrTGaming,"I played 1 raid on streets, took 7 minutes to load in, and then 1 minutes after deploying a cheater rushed me and killed me, sooo yeah haven't gone back."
AnthTWolf,Same thing happened for a dude on Lighthouse but apparently I managed to kill him and take his juice and lemme say...he was juicy af.
DeltaTwoZero,Suburbs?!
tlrelement,Is this Labs?
GuiltyComb9516,"He's out of the game. 
When you are loosing connection or fame crashed your PMS run like this."
Saltanistic,Ohio
misiaq,It was all just a dream
Twenty-Three23,Lmaooooo all around incredible clip
Jai_chingnut,"The amount of lag in this game in general is so bad but fucking hell everytime i play streets its a good minute of straight 10-20 fps then it levels out to 30 fps then just stuttering from the servers. One time i was running in a raid and fell dead on the floor, my mates checked my dog tag and i died to nothing, turns out i just got killed by the servers for no reason"
ProfessorKrung,\*and it was all a dream\*
Memm0ri,Dust2
313rd4L,Great game! Go BSG!!!
amac109,Why would you not just shoot him? Even during rubber banding kills will register
DeckerR,It was all a dream. I used to read Word Up magazine...
PurpleZerg,Lighthouse.
TheProck06,Factory
xPizzaKittyx,customs?
Leucauge,"So much rubber-banding on that map.

I'd understand bad frame-rates, but actually my frames were okay. But I kept getting the rubber-banding, and only on that map."
Sp1nGG,Thats a r/yesyesyesno case
Liisn,"I noticed that I broke the 420 upvotes with my upvote. So, I removed my upvote.

Good clip though"
kaw_e,ðŸ˜‚ðŸ« 
Clewds,I'm level 26 and I haven't even gone to streets on my pmc
LargeSticker,*it was all a dream*
e-kul,"So glad their tweet of ""up coming fixes"" (that we probably won't see for at least 2 months) said nothing about fixing Streets."
TheGamerSK,de_amigo
whiteboykos,Factory for sure
Collguydev,the bro in another dimension
Susman22,45 dollar game btw ðŸ’€
Richard-Long,Totally unexpected teleport lmfaoo wtf $100 beta btw
DjEgh,Uhh... Shoreline???
kentrak,The question is whether you got credit for the hits in your melee skill...
Dustin_Live,The streets reality.  I swear I rubber banded for 10 minutes 1 time.
skrecok,Labs
MOR187,They even wrote the map name wrong in the sbih description..
Istart2finish,What in the actually fuck
feeok331,You have to leg cheaters. For some reason god mode doesnâ€™t cover legs
Enlades,"If this wasn't a server issue, meaning that you DC while running. You'll be stuck in running animation where you were. Making the running sound but not going anywhere. Your character stops running the moment you relog. Happened to my squad.

But this is clearly streets.

I also have an idea on why this happens. If any pmc happens yo have maxed out their memory, they'll see a slideshow of the game. But during that time, the server lags just as they do."
1balgin,Woods?
Recent_Paramedic3970,It was all a dream
Wegehead,what do you think was happening on his screen? cos he was moving at the end
extaz93,"Come on bruh, they only worked for five years on this one."
same_actually,"It's not loading for me, so I assume it must be streets."
highvelocity0100,that was very satisfying because you didnt deserve that melee kill xD
_Bike_seat_sniffer,pure jank and always will be
Hassuneega,Victim on reddit: I JUST GOT KILLED BY AN INVISIBLE HACKER
