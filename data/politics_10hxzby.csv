wkomorow,Both McCarthy and the Democrats are down one vote each right now. McEachen's special election is Feb 21.  Not sure how long Stuebe will be out with his injuries  So it is getting trickier and trickier for McCarthy given that Republicans voted to require physical presence to vote in the Chamber.
BlotchComics,"GOP on student loan relief: ""You made the debt. You have to pay it off.""

GOP on paying the country's debts: ""Yeah. We're just not gonna do it."""
Dragoness42,You already voted to spend the money.  You don't get to vote against actually writing the check.
WheresTheCannon,"Fun fact:

Purposefully defaulting on your debt because you refuse to pay bills you've already racked up isn't ""fiscally conservative."""
stumpdawg,I'm glad we're finally getting the memo on dealing with these assholes.
paulfromatlanta,"If Republicans were to follow through and let the Government default, it would sky rocket interest rates -- that would really hurt major donors.

Thus, I believe they are bluffing."
g2g079,"Funny how they didn't care how much debt we were in when they had both houses and the executive branch. Instead they just gave huge tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy, putting us in even more debt. Let's not pretend that this is anything but part of their ""Starve the Beast"" tactic"
,[removed]
davidwb45133,"My second week as a bartender a patron ordered a shot of The Macallan 25, the most expensive single malt we had. To give you an idea of the cost, a couple could have had dinner and a decent bottle of wine there and spend less than that one drink. He nearly finished it before claiming it was off and refused to pay. That’s the dick move these republicans are trying to pull. My manager came out and offered the guy two choices: pay or talk to the police officers who were waiting at the door for him. That’s how Biden should play this."
Rated_PG-Squirteen,Can someone remind me if the GOP held the debt limit hostage when Donald was POTUS?
Wild_Guess_7402,"Deadbeat Republicans don’t want to pay their debts, sounds just like Trump/Elon."
FarceMultiplier,"Quick reminder that the Republicans increase deficits consistently more than the Democrats: https://towardsdatascience.com/which-party-adds-more-to-deficits-a6422c6b00d7

Sadly, the Republicans have been extremely effective in pushing the lie that they are fiscally responsible, where the truth is quite the opposite.

Edit: autocomplete annoyance"
mkt853,Good. I support President Biden on this. No negotiations. Zero. Zip. None. If there's a melt down let the Republicans own it. You wanted the House? You got it.
kandoras,"Dark Brandon: ""Congressman, you can have my answer now if you like.  My offer is this - nothing.  Not even the effort to dig your party out of batshit crazy land, which I would appreciate if you did personally."""
ChessLord144,"Put the corporate and high income personal tax rates back where they were before Reagan. VOILA! No more deficit and plenty of money for things like food for school kids, veterans' benefits, and national health care."
niarem22,"Democrats just need to figure out how to publicize what is happening because if the worst happens, people will just blame the president if they don't follow all of this closely"
Another_Road,"The GOP had 0 issue raising the debt limit three times under Trump. 

But now that there is a Democrat in office suddenly the deficit matters again."
Tronski,Will someone pleas call them out for the utter failure of the trump tax cuts to “pay for themselves “
Standard-Stan,"The party of Trump and Kevin McCarthy literally tried to overthrow democracy barely two years ago.

The fact we're even still discussing anything at all with them is just a terrifying indictment of how utterly fucked we are as a nation."
OwntheWorld24,"I would like to see the dems open with raising taxes on over $1 million back to Reagan era levels and Social Security Expansion, tax all income not just to the cap.  Take a strong position and make your case to the populace at large"
nimcau2TheQuickening,Kevin knows he needs to ask 14 more times in order to get anywhere.
poky2017,"If dark Brandon sticks to this, he will earn my respect and my support for the next election.

I never been super sold on him (voted for him for sure and wish the best) but this is what democrats need, call on the republicans bullshit."
Spudcommando,You don’t negotiate with terrorists. Good to see the Biden admin got the memo.
Former-Darkside,We really need to talk about the 7 TRILLION added to the national debt during the trump admin.
SenorBeef,"This is basically a hostage situation and we're all the hostages. There's a bomb in the room that needs to be defused once every year. We could simply choose to have the bomb be permanently defused, or not for there to be a bomb at all, but the person who has the defusing code wants to say ""give me what I want or I'll let the bomb blow us all up!"" every year, so they will only defuse it temporarily.

At some point you have to call their bluff, you can't keep letting them get what they want. And you have to hope they're not so fucking insane that they let the bomb go off and kill us all just for spite."
theoldgreenwalrus,"*Negotiate with these nuts, Jack*"
JustaBCer,"Look at Biden doing his job.  Go Biden go.  Stop letting these bullies get away with, well bullying."
PositionParticular99,"You don't 'negotiate' with republicans, you submit or nobody gets anything. The base actually believes they can stick it to libs with a government shutdown, and not affect them at all. Wait till all the food stamp money dries up in rural red America."
AwkwardBurritoChick,"Good.  McCarthy already exhibited that he's capable of breaking when he plays ""chicken"".   He gave in to get his speakership and gave up a lot of his own power and shit all over committee integrity to make 20 people who had no other option get what they want.  He caved to them, he'll cave to everyone.   

Unfortunately, this is going to impact a lot of people which is a real setback in these stupid games."
trollssuckeggs,About fracking time. Don't negotiate with terrorists (or traitors).
Evil_phd,Trying to flex his power as speaker when he's already given all of it away.
SpaceGrape,This is the benefit of having a career senator as POTUS. He knows the game. And he is a decent man. It’s so utterly opposite of Trump. I didn’t like GW Bush  as a president but he had decent qualities as a person. How “conservatives” supported and still support a grotesquely indecent man like Trump doesn’t surprise me but I will hold it against them for at least 20 years until the right wing electorate is significantly different due to a new generation. I won’t ignore the hypocrisy of current conservatives defending family values in one decade and supporting a filthy immoral traitor the next.
Saito1337,Absolutely the right call. Negotiating here is pointless and damaging.
Hiranonymous,"Once again, the GOP wants to ignore the US Constitution:

> **Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection and Other Rights**


>”*The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.*”"
avs72,"While I agree with fiscal responsibility, refusing to pay debts is not a part of that. 

Should we have more balanced budgets? Yes. However, there are more ways to balance a budget than just cutting spending. Taxes are a part of the equation. How about increasing the income limit on social security taxes or repealing (fully or partially) Trump/Bush era tax cuts?"
MinusPi1,"Good. The debt limit is nothing but a game of ""stop hitting yourself."" Not playing is the only way to make it stop."
r_bogie,"This dick measuring contest every couple of years is so exhausting and *STUPID!*

 That said, Biden better have the biggest one."
MoonageDayscream,"I'm printing my Mccarthy ""I did that!"" stickers rn."
GogetaSama420,FACT: Trump contributed to 25% of the national debt in all of our nations history. Food for thought
heimdahl81,"Just for fun, they should anti-negotiate. 

First offer: raise the debt ceiling and put the metal detectors back in the House.

Second offer: raise the debt ceiling, put the metal detectors back in the House, an take MTG off all committees.

Etc."
CoolCatInaHat,I guess the white house finally understands why you don't negotiate with terrorist.
dongballs613,Republicans trying to hold the country hostage for money they helped spend. Fucking deadbeats.
Alternative-Flan2869,Irresponsible ‘bargaining’ (threats!) with the entire integrity of the American economy for political theater is only something that shitbag fascist russian sympathizers like mccarthy would do. Stop voting for this cult trash.
Cityplanner1,Easy. Let’s just start stopping payments for things in the states represented by all who vote against it.
EdenG2,"US creditworthiness is being held hostage by the GOP.   If US payments are delayed by domestic politics, we are not a trustworthy economic leader."
rxinquestion,WH to McCarthy/GOP: Go fuck yourself and each other.
BurrrritoBoy,"Congress authorized the budget.  Those bills get paid.  Eat a bag of dicks, Kevin."
jsntsy,Republicans are really relying on their voters not understanding what a debt ceiling is.
Mynameisinuse,"GOP - We will conceede nothing. Give us more power or we will wreck the country and destroy the economy.

DEMS - NO

GOP - Why won't the Dems work with us?"
lordofedging81,"Never negotiate with terrorists.

They are holding the US economy hostage."
everydayhumanist,There is nothing to negotiate. Republicans always lose this debate.
Mo-shen,"Biden watched what happened when Obama gave in and then what happened when he refused the next time the ceiling came around. 

Don't get to keep doing it every time and expect anyone to trust you."
GayByTheBay,"So Republicans are offering a choice between risking a global economic meltdown by forcing a U.S. credit rating downgrade, or beginning the process of stealing the money that hundreds of millions of Americans have contributed to with the belief that it would be returned to them after retirement. 

I will not stand idly by and watch the history’s biggest grand larceny take place. Not when I’m one of those people who has contributed a percentage of my salary every month for more than forty years! Whoever tries to steal our money is going to wish that they were never born. 

Instead, let’s have the top economic tier contribute their fare share. These people have used the labor of others to amass that kind of wealth, watching their net worth balloon to unprecedented totals, while squeezing the working class for every cent possible. 

It’s time to return to the tax rate policies that existed immediately after WWII."
EridanusVoid,"The way I understand the Debt Limit is that the spending was done. The Debt Limit is like when you get the bill and refuse to pay it because it's too much. Now isn't the time for squabbling, save it for the actual budget."
AboveBoard,Year of the Trillion Dollar Coin! Come on!
Tointomycar,Someone should call for a new vote for the speaker
FUMFVR,"They have the opportunity to influence two spending bills. We already know they will not and the government will shutdown for an indeterminate amount of time, because they hate the country when they don't control it and would rather watch it burn."
janzeera,"Well, McCarthy only needs abt 5 sane republicans to vote for raising the limit. Though he’ll probably need those 5 plus all the democrats to keep him as Speaker after that vote."
rgeyedoc,We do not negotiate with terrorists.
extremekc,Can you imagine of McCarthy's group had to actually come up with their own budget?
Darth-Shittyist,"Sorry guys, the United States doesn't negotiate with terrorists."
ModeOk4781,"Could always tax
The rich appropriately. 
Just sayin."
HauntedCemetery,"Call their fucking bluff. Crashing the world economy fucks up the billionaires cash way more than working class, Republicans will never, ever allow that."
LA_search77,McCarthy is going to regret this job.
Commercial_Yak7468,I hope Biden and Democrats stick to their guns and don't give in. Call McCarthy bluff
luckydog1984,Fuck their feelings.
Scarlet109,Tying future spending to the bill for what has already been spent is idiotic.
ThomasGaiden,"We pay for these 'entitlements'. Our paychecks are deducted for social security, medicade, and medicare. We have already paid for these and continue to pay. They are not 'entitlements', we have been paying for them. Our reps have been irresponsible and have rebranded our community safety net as an entitlement because they used our money.
I do not think we dissolve these safty nets. But we need to make them untouchable for govt spending. That includes the 244k paycheck our senators receive. (with Healthcare for life)"
annaleigh13,There should be no negotiations. Article 14 clearly states the debt limit has to be raised. End of story
Dr3adPir4teR0berts,"Hear me out here. Just do what a Republican would do and tell the treasury to pay it regardless.

It’s time to just stop listening to these people as if they have any serious solution to anything other than trolling."
Wrong-Acanthaceae511,"Republicans are quickly becoming a domestic threat. 

And a whole lot of us have sworn to protect this country from threats both foreign, AND domestic."
Charyou-Tree,"The abusers in the republican party are now at the ""Don't make me hit you!"" phase.

Trying to leave your abuser is the most dangerous time, but its always worth it to enforce your boundaries.

No, you get *nothing* for not purposely sabotaging the economy."
Magister1995,We don't negotiate with insurrectionists loving domestic terrorists.
hunt509,We don't negotiate with terrorists!!!
CemetaryWind,"Freedom Caucus wants Biden to resign in return for passing a budget.  McCarthy wants a win, some kind of concession, after looking so weak and to undermine Biden's tough talk during the 2022 election cycle.  Biden knows he can't negotiate because the GOP is too split to ever agree on anything.  The Democrats have laid to rest the goal of bipartisanship because its a dead end and everything the GOP wants is a step towards fascism."
Disastrous-Golf7216,If they shut down the government the first paychecks to be stopped should be to all of congress.
throw123454321purple,McCarthy’s gonna lose this one.
trouser-chowder,"""We will not negotiate with terrorists."""
Jpldude,We don't negotiate with terrorists
TheBlackUnicorn,"McCarthy wanted to be Speaker, he begged for the job, he should want to do the job."
drj4130,"The United States once held the stance, under Republican Jesus, to not negotiate with terrorists. Glad to see Dark Brandon keep the tradition alive…"
bl8ant,"That’s my boy,  not pulling his punches with these orange clown posse jerkoffs."
Khal1505,Yes! Need to absolutely stonewall these obstructionists.
,Americans do not negotiate with these right wing demon possessed terrorists in the GQP.
metengrinwi,"If the Republicans put us in default, it will damage the country’s credit rating and cost us **more** money in the form of higher interest.

If they want to cut spending, they’re free to pass a budget that cuts spending."
ihwip,"I just want him to say, ""we don't negotiate with terrorists""

Because that is literally what it is. 9/11 was an attack on our economy to make political gains. How is this any different?"
Christ_votes_dem,"whats funny is republicans are threatening to hold Americans hostage 


like admitting we arent on the same side"
Aschrod1,There is no negotiating with terrorists. A lot of Rs are terrorists and should be in jail for their crimes. It’s ridiculous we as a people are just letting this happen. Ditto Brett and our Supreme Court. It’s more than shameful it’s damning. We are all guilty for not stopping the madness that has gone on for the past 6 years. For what? Money? We fucking suck.
IllustriousHost768,"This is absolutely the right stance.   No negotiations with terrorists, which the current bunch of House Republicans definitely are. They are economic terrorists who have overplayed their hand.  They can go to H."
kingtucker10,I can't believe I support Biden on this but I do and so do a lot.of people I know locally. Fuck the Republicans big time regarding this...
esoteric_enigma,"They need to keep this energy. Write a clean bill raising the debt ceiling. Pass it in the Senate. Then have every single Democratic politician come out saying they have a bill but Republicans refuse to sign it.

Have them explain what the debt ceiling is and how it's money the country has already spent. Make it 100% clear that any government shut down will be completely on the Republicans."
13zerocool,This is why we need to tax churches. Even if we taxes all the billionaires at 100% it would barely make a dent in the national debt. But if we taxes churches we'd have money to spare after a couple years. Fuck religion and those charlatan con artists not paying any taxes
Stewart987a,In the article it mentions that McCarthy said he wants to negotiate entitlement programs. That just means the GOP wants to fuck over poor people. So the status quo for the GOP is guess.
ProgrammingAccount90,I honestly feel like all the layoffs going on are companies preparing for Republicans to drag this country into a massive recession. All of the evidence points to that being the cause.
PangeaPanda,"Yeah, remember the US doesn’t negotiate with terrorists."
nemoomen,I don't know if the 14th amendment route is smart given the current Supreme Court but it sure should be in the Constitution that Congress can't pass one law saying the executive must spend X dollars while another says the executive branch can't borrow X dollars to pay for the thing they must do.
Snarl_Marx,The US does not negotiate with [domestic terrorists.](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/72/75/22785880/4/rawImage.jpg)
torgofjungle,We don’t negotiate with terrorists
To-Far-Away-Times,These are the continuing consequences of the Trump 2017 tax cuts that were focused almost entirely on corporations and the richest .01%. They cut corporate taxes from 34%to 21%.
tubulerz1,No! No Kevin! Bad dogs don’t get rewards
uptownjuggler,America does not negotiate with terrorists
cheezeyballz,No negotiating with terrorists.
Kind_Manufacturer_97,The US pays our debts.

Ursomonie,That’s my President
booey777,McCarthy is screwed. Another week as speaker. Two maybe.
walterkurve,Facist gop
MedricZ,Finally! Should have always been this way.
whatsinaname1970,Never negotiate with terrorists
Loud-Practice-5425,You don't negotiate with terrorists.
AceCombat9519,Is this the norm for the GOP to raise the Debt celling which dates back to World War I 1917 and play chicken with it
stickmanDave,"Holding a gun to the head of the US economy and threatening to pull the trigger if their demands are not met.

It's straight up terrorism."
Tautou_,"Good. Mint the coin, or just point to the 14th amendment. 

SCOTUS strikes it down? Cool. Let them enforce their ruling."
Beerbonkos,These mental wet farts are going default us. They want to tear it all down.
Equal_Memory_661,"There’s a good reason you don’t negotiate with terrorist. If the GQP was rewarded with spending concessions (I.e. slashing our benefits), then next time they’ll use exactly the same tactic for who knows what (national abortion ban, corporate welfare, roll back the clean water act…).  If they want to reduce the deficit, then why cut the IRS? If the wealthy weren’t constantly engaged in tax evasion perhaps there’d not be the mismatch between revenue and expenditure."
Capitan_Failure,"I genuinely have to ask.  How are republican voters so incredibly stupid that they actually believe repeated government shut downs are anything but a problem caused by republicans.  You literally have to put a LOT of effort into being that much of an idiot.  There is no spinning this.  It is mind baffling watching this happen over and over, and yet somehow, each time, my in-laws TRULY believe its democrats fault.  I can not fathom how they can honestly believe this, yet still manage to have the mental capacity necessary to put a 2 word sentence together."
Ecstatic-Charts,The US is a jokez
JadedIdealist,We don't negotiate with terrorists.
extremelight,Republicans have been manufacturing crisises after crisises lately. But this one might take the cake. *Easily* preventable but the risk is global econonic catastrophe? Come on
Lirdon,I love that the dems call the republicans on their bluff.
TitansboyTC27,Looks like Bidens white house has learned there lesson republicans tried to pull this stunt back in 2010 or 2011 threatening to hold the debt ceiling hostage
Ausgezeichnet87,"Republican blew 20 trillion on blowing up goat farmers in the middle east and now they are acting like the government is too broke pay our bills,  invest in infrastructure or anything that helps workers.


It is all part of their Starve the Beast strategy"
MrDickerrDown,"We.

Do. 

Not.

Shall not.

Will not. 

Negotiate.

With.

Terrorists. 


Full stop."
RogerCraigfortheHOF,We don't negotiate with terrorists.
CouchHam,This is such a joke. We all knew this would immediately happen once they took the house. There should be no negotiation.
GenXUser,100% Government shutdown coming
DavidGlennCox,Republican just don't like to pay bills. Make the elderly and disabled pay the bills.
McNuttyNutz,As it should be
The_Stoned_Economist,Prime r/DarkBrandon material right here.
Narrator-to-gods,"That’s the way to do it. 
Dear Republicans: you wanted the house and now you got it. You send America into default it’s on you and you alone. 

Oh as a side note: the world has watched you try to hide yourselves from the coup of January 7. The world has watched your Trump bone head and we’ve watched your openly racist and despicable congress people, now you’re following that all up with a possible default. History will it be kind to your type."
Seeminus,> We don’t negotiate with terrorists
kafkadre,We don't negotiate with terrorists.
AnImperialGuard,Good. We should not slink back in the face of Congress’s biggest pushover.
JuniorHS,Does McCarthy really want a shutdown? He’s got to be wondering how long he’d be able to hold his razor thin majority together before enough moderates split and the vote goes the other way. That’d destroy his speakership.
MoonageDayscream,"Well we have seen how he negotiates, he just keeps trying until he gives in completely."
haltline,"If the republicans choose the crash the economy, it's on them 100%.

Enough of these insultingly childish games."
Phreekyj101,We don’t negotiate with terrorists !!
