O115,Sometimes I make AI scavs walk through barbed wire until they die so I can use their loot without losing rep.
fpsgamer2,"300h in my biggest war crime was while scaving to ask a guy ""hey bro, do you have  wd-40 for a hideout upgrade"" he told me yes man but I need it too, shot him in the face, extracted, upgraded the stash but I feel horrible lol."

dongstrongmd,"I was teaching my buddy Resort on Shoreline last wipe. We‚Äôre fucking around talking and I come up the west side stairs in the beginning of the raid, I peek a corner and straight MURDER some dude in t5/t6 switchblade backpack meta‚Äôd out mutant with drums of bp on him.

We hear some dude voiping from the room across the hall, you killed my sherpa I‚Äôm only lvl 8 I‚Äôm new etc etc. i didn‚Äôt believe him. We asked him some questions through the wall and I was pretty sure dude was lying about being new. I‚Äôm like alright bud you can run out and leave or we‚Äôre coming in and just gonna cap your ass. After a few back and forths my ACTUAL new friend strafes the doorway and one taps the dude; both were lvl 50+ decked in gear, dude was pretending to be a Timmy while dipping his shit over the balcony lmfao"

Poderetour,"On the first week of Streets I heard a lot of gunfights and decided I would check it out as a scav. After investigation I found one PMC that had his leg blacked out and no more meds, he asked for help do I checked my backpack and.. there it was, a surgery kit ! So I dropped it, then dropped him. 

PMC :""I'm just trying to figure the map out, man, thank you.""

ME: ""Same bro."" *Mosin shot to his chest*

PMC as he's falling to the ground : ""Yep.""

Free MDR but I feel bad to this day."
vegan-jesus,Nice try UNTAR.
youknowthename,"Pre-voip few wipes ago and Pre-Impact nade. Load into factory thick with a rig full of nades to spam so I could get my last Grenadier. Spawn in the room at the end of glass hallway, run out and check the hallway and see nobody.. peak left, hear a noise, throw some nades,  they don‚Äôt die, they pushed me and I killed a them with the M4.. I hear a noise just outside the door near the tanks, open the door and see a hatchet guy .. I wiggle, then gesture to the body of the dude I just killed. He comes running over very excitingly, looks at the body and looks back at me, I gesture for him to loot it, he wiggles very quick and crouches up and down in excitement, turns around and starts looting.. I shoot the legs.. he turns around and looks very confused as I‚Äôm pulling out the f-1 .. he began swinging his hatchet as he walked at a snails pace slowly towards me just before he dies. 

I have the video and it still cracks me up. I felt bad at the time and kind of still do, but I added him and explained and he said he understood, but I friended him and asked what map he likes, so we loaded into woods. We spawned outskirts and I gave him a slick+exfil combo, couch bag, a 40ish recoil M4 and 4x60s of 55a1 as a thank you for helping me finish Grenadier. He looked very excited again when I stood there naked with my RR and he shot me the face. 

He messaged me later to say he didn‚Äôt last 5 minutes and died at scav checkpoint."
C_Forde," Last wipe when I had nearly full scav karma on interchange I convinced a fully kitted pmc to follow me to the Co-op extract, by throwing my gun on the ground in front of him and taking my knife out. 

 I then led him straight to Killa who I‚Äôd seen earlier chilling  in Mantis. Got a hex grid and and a fully kitted m4 with hundreds of rounds of m995 and a lifetime of guilt"
Ajfman,There was a streamer that we used to run into on interchange a lot who was just the most annoying cringey dude. He would whine about every death and was just a prick to anyone who came into his stream. One day he kills one of my buddies and runs and hides and we thought hell no we‚Äôre not letting him get away. Homie pulls up his stream but he blacked out his screen to prevent stream sniping. So we start shooting around the mall and sprinting around where we last saw him listening to his stream and eventually echo-locate him. I‚Äôm not proud of it but on the other hand I kind of am. You just have to take my word for it he had it coming. Or don‚Äôt thats ok.
Ozza360,"It‚Äôs a bad one and I‚Äôm fairly embarrassed. 

Needed the 3 bolty kills under 25m. This one‚Äôs caused me some pain in the past. Spawn behind the box at the end of the corridor on Factory and go hide in the container near office. Naked hatchling runs past. Mosin him to death. Find another player who‚Äôs trying to plant for farming part 1. I explain I‚Äôll help protect him whilst he plants. As he‚Äôs planting, BANG. Pop him in the head. Run down towards the forklift and hear another player hiding in the little room, I tell him my friend got murdered and could he help me plant. He came out to help, murdered him from 1 ft away :(. Felt like a monster, will no doubt have bad karma for the rest of my Tarkov life, but I did get Tarkov Shooter completed in a single raid. RIP my little friends."
BF_Goose,"Situation was similar to yours, questing on streets with 3 other friends. All get wiped out by this one lvl 41. It‚Äôs a stalemate between the two of us. Player scav pulls up, trying to loot everything. Temporary truce was made and the scav was dead. Dude for some reason didn‚Äôt know I was the 4th person from original group. Deceived him until he turned his back on me. The revenge felt scummy, but I couldn‚Äôt let this dude that killed all my friends and the proceed to loot them. It was also 5 am, and my friends were screaming at me to kill him. Thanks for coming to ted talk, I‚Äôll eventually upload the vod."
Tiaesstas,"A few wipes ago me and a teammate went down to Reserve underground to face a 4 man squad, he got clapped i cleared 3 of them and the 4th enemy ran away. At that time we only played a single server in launcher server selection so my team mate sniped that raid as a scav. He came down to me to underground and eventually found the 4th man hiding on the way down to D2 extract, he told that guy that the underground was full of bodies to loot. at first the guy tried to convince my mate(scav) that there is a remaining PMC and he(me) might be cheating but after some talking my mate made him believe everything was clear and no other PMC was down there so the 4th man followed him all the way back from almost D2 to the ramp leading to underground. I was just camping that corner waiting for them to come by and after my mate had pass me i jumped out the corner blasting the 4th guy.

End of story: my mate hid his stuff, lootet half the guys, i looted the other half, we left with the pmc+scav extract for that 10/10 betrayal.

&#x200B;

Other than that: i am sometimes talking to other PMCs while i am doing PMC kill quests just to get their attention or trust just to blast them afterwards for my quest."
killertrout1,"Watched some dude go for the pocket watch, I shed a tear and shot him as he unlocked the truck."
OperatorDelta07,"Had to go back and copy/paste this from our discord group. This occurred maybe a week or two into this wipe. Hope you enjoy. 

A cautionary tale of greed and murder so foul. I spawned as a scav without a backpack. Looted around, finding decent stuff. But then I searched the big crate by the heli on reserve. To my surprise was a sledgehammer inside of it. It is a 2x4 space item. I desperately searched for 10-15 minutes for a bag, asking fellow scavs along the way. But to no avail. In the last 3 minutes I decided to head towards extract, right past the crate holding my desired treasure. Lo and behold I witness a man leaving said crate also going towards extract, and he happens to have a T20 bag. A glance at the crate reveals a stack of useless items on the ground, to make space for the sledgehammer of course. So, there it was that my mind was made, made for murder. I follow the man into the black pawn building, and I see him standing there looting a duffle bag, innocently, ignorant to my intentions. I had no hesitations in my act, I shot him in the face, twice. But now there is less than 2 minutes remaining in the raid. I quickly throw on the slain mans backpack without searching it and sprint for the extract. But alas, when I view the end of raid screen, there is no sledgehammer to behold. I murdered an innocent man in cold blood for some rechargeable batteries, blue tape, and other assorted junk."
e-kul,Day one of wipe I blasted someone that was struggling to find Jaeger's note in Woods. I watched for a minute as he looked around and then put him down... Still feel bad about it.

Isac1995,"Met a Timmy, he said this was only his third raid.

This was on lighthouse so I showed him how to farm the rogues (last patch). I let him take most of the good loot and showed him where the extract was. As we were running to the vehicle extract, I dropped him some money. As he reached down, I said ‚ÄúWelcome to Tarkov, bitch‚Äù and shot him once in the head.

I literally treated him as a loot donkey üíÄ"
Clewds,"I had a truce broken on me!

3 story dorms, my mate pushes up the middle stairs and kills one on level 2 only to die to a second guy on level 3. I push up the metal stair to level 3 and voip ""well this is awkward, you killed my friend"" 

The guy responds ""well you killed my buddy too"". I replied ""ah fuck, well maybe we can just scoop our respective buddies loot and scoot?"" He was amendable, my buddies loot was in the hall and he was looking directly at me. 

I begin to loot my mates stuff, in inventory and he starts shooting at me in a perfect impression of a stormtrooper. I had enough time to get out of my inventory and start spraying at his head with my baby AK. I fell the curr and scream ""FUCKIN AWKWARD BUD"" 

Guy had me dead to rights and somehow still fucked it up. If you're gonna betray someone helpless just shoot them in the face lol."
xBrobeard,"Last wipe I had a non found in raid gas analyzer and needed to get 2 pmcs kills with a tremor. I told a low level I have a gas for him and dropped it. As he said ""omg really""while picking it up, I blasted him point blank with a mosin. I'm sorry little one. 
I've been nicknamed the BaitAnalzyer among my friends."
CPollard187,"Asked a fellow pmc for food. As he went into his bag to look, I took his head off. I needed PMC kills with a scav vest and balaclava‚Ä¶.. I forgot to put my balaclava on"
IEatLotsOfButter,"Me and my friend decided that after 4 days of spankings in customs, we wanted to do the spanking. So I had this horrible memory of rushing over the little container/bridge/island from garage to dorms when I was new to the game. Unknownst to me a 4-man chad squad camped under the bridged  and I died by a barrage of bullets shredding my frail ungeared Timmy body into minced meat.

 Anyways, I wanted to re-create this fond memory to release some anger towards some unlucky bastards.

I had an sks, my friend had an ppsh. We waited for 10 minutes, and I hear my friend scream he sees two people running down the hill from the railway.

We started to shoot at them. The least geared guy rushed and hid on the island, and the other one hid up the hill in a bush. We rushed over whilst shootimg. We executed Timmy as he was looking up through a small patch of grass on the island. Instantly killed. The other guy was not so lucky, he was crrawling up the hill because my friend shot his legs off. I slowly walked up behind him as he desperately tried to crawl away from his dire fate  and shot him point blank in the head.

Timmy on Island was lvl 3 with 2 mac n'cheeses and one makarov with one spare mag.

The other one was a lvl 2 freshspawn, literally had the setup you get as you create ur pmc.

We laughed, and cried so hard."
everlasted,"At the end of .12.10 they had that event where all bosses spawned on Reserve, and you'd get 100k USD if you took the co-op extract (either as player or scav). For those who aren't familiar, basically every raid would have like 5 player scavs hanging out at the co-op extract, excitedly waiting for a PMC to show up so everyone could extract and get that sweet 100k.

One raid I had killed Killa and taken all his shit and headed towards extract. There was probably like 6 player scavs waiting there, and for some reason instead of extracting I decided to just mow every single one of them down with the 95 round drum full of igonik in full Killa cosplay."
Zavodskoy,"I was doing stirrup last night and killed some level 6 trying to stash the item on factory for prapor, poor guy was begging for his life as I came through the door, he didn't even bring a gun with him.

Bean_Paste,"Early this wipe, instead of getting the machine key for the bronze pocket watch, I waited for someone to open the cab door. A naked came and opened it and for some reason I shot him once. Thankfully I realized I was being a dick and stopped shooting but unfortunately he ran into view of sniper scav and died.

That's probably the most dirty rat move I've ever done in tarkov."

SnooWoofers9648,"Told a guy I wouldn‚Äôt kill him and he could freely go into weather building on shoreline. Problem was I said that I would not kill him, my buddy with M62 in his RFB needing one more scav vest kill on the other hand had said no such thing üòÇ. 

That or when I was sniping from the top of weather tower and head someone open the safe in weather (great audio) but couldn‚Äôt see anything but knees so I took out dudes legs and tossed a nade in there. Shoreline makes a man do evil things."

CrayonBerry157,"My friend and I were PMC's on Interchange. Buddy had two graphics cards in his butt. We were making our way to extract going underground. I tried to turn on my flashlight, only to accidentally chuck a nade right at his feet.. killing him. I felt horrible."
MrHappydust,I found a hammer on a scav raid and I couldn't take it so I went and found a player scav and told him about it. Him and his 3 buddies go pick it up. I have my friend tell them there's a pmc running towards Idea (we were at National). I let them run down the middle all the way to entrance. I hung back so when they got all the way down I sniped all 3 with a VSS and took the backpack with the hammer in it. Got my gym.
Mercinator-87,"I went to reserve and found a dead pmc with an ash next to his body. Two pmcs were running back towards their kills to loot. I asked them, ‚Äúhey did you kill this guy with the ash?‚Äù They replied ‚Äúyeah we are coming back to loot, just leave it and you can get out.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúNah, I want matching dog tags.‚Äù Then killed them both with my new ash."

CannibalFruit,"I agreed to help a player via voip with his quest if he helped me with mine first. He agreed without asking what quest I was on and appeared from his cover and walked over to me with a sense of security and nativity. What he sees standing before him is myself clad in a scav vest and a balaclava with one more kill required. I dropped him. And my quest pinged. 
In all fairness I did try to contact them afterwards to keep my end of the bargain but my request was denied."
autismo-nismo,Me and my 5 stack forced a lone PMC to strip and dance in a night raid and we made him run through the cultists to lure them out. He lived. Followed us all the way to extract with his gear in our bags and then lined him up against the wall because he was a bear. Emptied 60 rounds of ppbs into him.
Obl1v1on390,"Somehow the opposite of this tactic. I‚Äôm a pretty passive player so if I‚Äôm in a fight I‚Äôll often ask other players for a cease fire. Sometimes we come to an understanding and go out ways other times they‚Äôll decline and we just keep shooting, or the worst they‚Äôll bash me for even thinking of making peace. So according to some players making peace is a crime in this game"
Flamingo0303,"I took two of my friends to shoreline yesterday, and we spawned to the side of resort. We needed to get to the tank near sniper scav.

I took both of his legs and then ran up and killed him with my red rebel.."
NerdWithARifle,"On reserve, I heard a man in the tech dropdown. He sounded decently geared, his footsteps were heavy and his gun clacked like it had a lot of attachments. I threw 7 grenades in there before I finally stopped hearing him

He was a level 2 who had found a car battery. His gun was broken like he had gotten it from a scav. Poor guy must have been terrified"

Told him no worries as long as he kept his knife out we could just walk to extract, talking the whole time and then he asked me if I would damage it for him to get it below 50. So I tapped it one shot at a time and finally he's like okay okay it's good, and I shot him in the face 5ft from extract and walked out with the Zabralo."
Stunning_Language_25,Killed someone doing the drop off quest of the sv98 and multi tool on shoreline didn't even let him finish..... felt guilty.
Shaggy05,Was doing punisher part 6 a couple wipes ago. Me and my friend pushed a guy at the cottages and he begged to be friends. We agreed and when he came out he asked what we needed.

Sanctified_Savage,"At Reserve, my buddy and I are playing and going to bunker. I‚Äôm running my most expensive kit: Meta M4, AVS, Ops Core Helmet, Comtac 4s‚Ä¶ There are scavs, pscavs, and PMCs everywhere. I head eyes one pmc peeking out of a doorway, then end up in a firefight with a player scav who I wound and he runs off. I hear a VOIP voice to my left and it‚Äôs another player scav. 

I choose not to shoot him and he walks up and talks to us a little bit before 2 more scavs appear down the hallway where I shot the last guy. I loose some rounds in their direction and those guys go back into the doorway in the hallway. Scav buddy goes ‚ÄúNO WAIT, THEY‚ÄôRE COOL!‚Äù

Scav Buddy then proceeds to go down and tell them I‚Äôm cool. He brings them back down the hallway towards me. Before one of them can get around to my backside, I switched to full auto and melted the 2 new player scavs. Then I turn and shot at scav buddy, he goes ‚ÄúNO WAIT!!!.‚Äù

Then I shot him in the head too. My buddy asked me why. I told him I wasn‚Äôt losing my best kit to getting shot in the back of the head by a scav."
TheJonJonJonJon,"Customs raid with my brother. We spawned at trailer park and my brother jumped on the roof of the garages and started popping shots at someone heading into the directors office of big red. After about 5-10 minutes of waiting for the guy to pop his head back up (he didn‚Äôt) we then pushed into big red and voiped with the guy who said that someone had been shooting at him, we lied and said we killed the player who it was. He was there for a quest so we let him out of the office and agreed to part ways shortly after but, I said we needed a safe word incase we bumped into each other again. In discord my brother said to shoot him. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt have but, just as I said the safe word was ‚Äúpizza‚Äù, I shot him in the face.

Edit: just remembered I also killed an inexperienced player scav during a scav run on reserve. We teamed up at K buildings and then ran to the bunker. After he was done looting some of the filing cabinets he (foolishly) told me he had found a flash drive. I shot him in the back of the head when he started looting one of the supply crates back in the main room. I needed that flash drive.

Edit 2: And also, a couple of wipes ago I lured two timmies down into the tunnels in factory so my brother could get stirrup done."
yalljustlovetocry,"I had just did the signal quest on the roof and was walking away. Some guy came running up those loud ass clunky stairs and had no idea I was there üòÇ.

I was like I‚Äôm doing it to so I‚Äôm cool finish it up man. he would‚Äôve never survived if we fought afterwards cuz I hit him plenty.

Thederpdoge,"The other day i spawned in on Woods as a scav where i met a pmc almost immediatly who was looting a crate, he looked kinda juiced so I popped him before he spotted me.

Sanctified_Savage,"I was running a 4 with a group of randoms I met on discord. Naturally, we‚Äôve got one little Timmy in the group. We‚Äôre at reserve at the helicopter and another team of 3 surfaces near little Timmy by one of the reserve buildings. We hear little Timmy tell these guys we are friendly and they come out and start talking to him. Me and the other guy in the group walk up and shoot these three at point blank range and yell at little Timmy that we aren‚Äôt friendly. This kid gets his feelings hurt and doesn‚Äôt shut up for the remainder of the raid. So at the end of the raid at extract I shot timmy in the back of the head. Had to teach him a lesson, but I‚Äôm not sure what the lesson is. Real toxic behavior, but it was hilarious."

KaizuhR,I spawned in on factory in the long hallway where you do the toolset quest and heard someone coming so I pleaded with him I‚Äôm just doing the quest and I‚Äôm just laying down waiting for him and glad to say he had the extra toolset I forgot
MazalTovCocktail1,"I was playing with friends and one of them was taking a while to load in. His character appeared before he actually finished loading, so when I turned a corner and saw a PMC I didn't hesitate and double-tapped his head with my RFB.

He hasn't really played since."
TheBigZamboni85,"I was laying down on rocks overlooking new gas/shipment on customs during a night raid. I needed to kill reshala for a quest so I was just scoping out new gas when I saw a PMC through my thermal walking down in the middle of shipment. I decided to troll him a bit so I blacked his legs so that he would be stranded so to speak. Right after I black his legs, reshalas guards step out the back of new gas and aggro to the guy because he started spraying over the wall in my general direction. I proceeded to just watch in silence as reshala and the boys chucked nades over the wall right at his feet. One of the few things I've witnessed in tarkov that had me in tears from laughter. I later looted him and saw he was level 3. Took his tag but ditched his gear. Felt bad about that one lol"
Royal_Ad_9750,Two guys in 3 story dorms though I was solo and they friended me. My team was in two story. An airdrop landed behind bus depot. I told my team to set an ambush. I casually asked the two friendly guys if they wanted to loot the drop with me. When we got to the box my team sprung the ambush. I was called a ‚Äúmotherfu‚Ä¶..‚Äù before the voip cut off üòÇ it was a glorious trap.

allPanic_noDisco87,"It wasn‚Äôt a crime intentionally committed, but a couple of wipes ago I was on the wall behind dorms at customs heading towards sniper roadblock. I saw a guy trying to sneak through the bushes and killed him.

VisionQuesting,"I was working on Friend From the West pt 1 earlier this wipe - having a tough time because it seems like there are WAY more Bears this wipe than ever before. Desperately needed some USEC kills. I was kitted pretty heavily and pushing 2 story dorms with my duo partner.

Suddenly a nervous Timmy's voip erupts from within as we approach. He pleas with us: ""please don't kill me guys I'm a naked pistol runner just trying to mark objectives."" He was hiding in one of the first floor rooms and I assured him we would let him pass, which I genuinely did intend on doing. The moment he emerged from his hidey hole with that stock USEC outfit of green chest and camo arms it reminded me of my struggles acquiring USEC kills and he caught a burst of BT. Poor guy probably has some serious trust issues now.

I tried to redeem myself a few days later by catching a Timmy placing his multitool and SV98 on shoreline, pinned him in the little changeroom with the stash as he begged for his life. I promised I'd leave him alone and I let him live. I was lucky he decided not to deliver some karma as I walked away carelessly.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø"

Odd_Juggernaut_8652,"Not so much a crime as the guy shot first, but I felt so bad afterwards either way.

A friend, his sister, and I were on customs, had a few hairy firefights but all survived and were heading to extraction at crossroads. My friend decided to check out big red on the way. His sister and I decided to clear out storage. As soon as we entered storage through the corner gap by big red, I heard 1 shot go over our heads and reacted. I had a Gornostay with no scope (shooter part 1) and instantly headshotted the guy.

We clear out the rest of storage with no action. I go to loot the guy, level 2, mp5, paca, a bunch of meds and food. Poor guy had probably been in storage for most of the raid. I felt so bad that I dumped all his gear in a bush.

Like I said, he shot first, so it's his fault. But I still feel like I committed some crime. Hope he got his starter gear back safely.

I took all the food and meds, obviously."
QuickKill,"Needed one more kill inside reserve barracks. Found a player scav near helicopter, so I asked if he wanted to extract together.

JeffBenzos,"Once I killed a lvl 2 at the gate by resorts theater. It was the darkest night and I saw them just standing there spinning around looking lost and I figured it was just an ai scav bc they kind of do that sometimes.

keenhydra93,"I usually make it an effort not to stream snipe if I get killed by a streamer, always go in to say hi and ggs

But this one guy was so toxic about killing 2 of our 4 man and he was just raging on my friend that was still alive and throwing all grenades he could find and generally being salty about it all. Even went as far to call my friend a cheater after he killed him.

So we noticed he ditched his own gear and was wearing ours as to insurance fraud his own. 
But being salty as he was about it all I went back in his vod and searched for where he ditched his own gear and his buddies(also streamers) gear and directed my friend to it and directed him which gear to pick up to that guy would get nothing back"
TheBlu3Duck,I‚Äôm a kill on sight kind of guy. Me and the squad were going through shoreline and I hear voip. My squad mate was talking to another pmc with his hatchet out. I stroll over and kill hatchet man and my buddy takes his friend out. It‚Äôs war folks
No_Analyst3861,"My lowest moment turned redemption happened last night. 

Spawn in as a 3 man scav in customs.  2 of us spawn storage other one spawns fortress.   The 2 of us in storage get engaged immediately by a PMC who runs off after taking some fire back and as we look around for him, our 3rd radios that he's killed a scav in fortress and is now tagged and cursed obviously.   He runs to hide in weapon room as he here's footsteps coming and calls for us to get over there and try to diffuse the situation. 

We get there in a good amount of time and we come across a player scav holding the entrance and voiping with our friend just back and forth banter of my friend trying to talk his way out of it.  

We join the conversation and pretend we don't know the guy in the room, and ask the player scav holding the door what's going on.  He VOIPS to us saying there's a trader scav inside and says ""yknow what we do to traitor scavs"" as he unpins a grenade and goes to throw it in the room, I shoot him in the back of the head dropping him instantly.  We manage to avoid any more engagements and survive the raid.  Upon leaving were met with the stats page where I'm plus 3 scav rep.  Turns out the scav holding the door was ALSO a traitor scav and was trying to fool us.  

So moral of the story. Shoot when you think you can get away with it.  It might work out in your favor."

There was one time I betrayed someone because I had multiple quest items on me, and he asked me and my friend if he could plant something. I let him plant but killed him after. the last thing he heard was ""im sorry bro Ill hide your stuff!"" 

this still haunts me to this day."
Oliver0043,3 of us were in factory and a 2 man team killed 2 of my teammates. So I voiped to them claiming I was new and that the 2 guys they killed were showing me the map.

He was fucking delighted, I could hear the joy in his little scav voice. I paused for a moment to watch as he began looting an especially juiced Chad with a decked M4, old boy just kept thanking me.

JustinTime1237,I was doing Humanitarian Supplies on shoreline and needed one more scav kill. Was on the cliff face shooting at the scavs outside west wing by the truck. Got my kills and was heading for extract. Heard someone jumping on the fence to leave west wing and stopped under the tree. He spotted me almost instantly from my blue boy armor. I voip ‚Äúplease please no please don‚Äôt I just need one more scav kill for my quest. I‚Äôve tried 4 times to get my last kill and I keep dying to players. Please don‚Äôt kill me‚Äù he says ‚Äúok you go that way and I go this way since I have a quest item I need.‚Äù We go on our separate ways and I need shooterborn and punisher part 4 kills. I took off my blue armor so I wouldn‚Äôt be spotted so easy and took cover in a bush. Waited for him to be walking out of stamina and shot him in the back of the head with my sv-98. Got my last shooterborn for shoreline and my 6/10 kill for punisher. I felt terrible immediately and threw his stuff except for his west wing loot
blandpoodlemojo,Who doesn't ask for a scav voice line? I'd never trust it until I head the voice line
Bacch,"Hmm.  Probably have killed more than one newbie still in fresh out of the box kit that comes with your character as they try to run up to the Director's Office and beg over VOIP for me to not kill them because they're just on a task and won't shoot.  Similarly, the scav on Woods who it turns out was begging for a joint extract and only armed with a knife--but in that case, I had opened fire by the time he started yelling and didn't see the knife until he hit the ground.

Have definitely popped a friendly scav once or twice while carrying some crazy loot.  Didn't want to risk losing the GPU or something to someone who I didn't know and may well have splattered me as soon as I turned around.  But we're talking maybe 2-3 times in 4 wipes, so that's rare.

Edit:  Not war crime level, but definitely have slaughtered a few looted to shit chads while being a bush wookie.  Like, 65+ kilos waddling to extract losing stamina just walking and I still left loot behind level of looted to shit.  One in particular was running the eastern wall on Shoreline, sprinting towards Road to Customs (must have popped a Mule and had max strength or something), I heard him coming long before he saw or heard me and I dove in that big cluster of bushes about halfway down the wall.  Waited until he came around the bend panting and recovering stamina and emptied a full 60 rounder of 5.45 BP into him.  Poor bastard."

Nerftrolly,"So I am notorious for killing my friends in Tarkov. These TKs happen for a variety of reasons but normally its simply because of poor communication mixed with high anxiety of a wild team on team gunfight. This story however has none of those elements which is what makes it so brutal. 

This was back when Interchange had just been released. A foue stack of my friends and I are coming back with a rats load of crap from all over the mall. If memory serves me correctly this was also when the mosin was about 13k to buy so were all rocking mosins and clowning around. 

We head toward the railway extract and because the raid was dead we all decided to shoot our guns at one another haphazardly. I decide to not aim at anyone specifically and just shoot in a random direction. I shoot my shot and we immediately hear one of our friends who was much farter ahead of us say they had just been killed. My heart sinks. Shirley it wasnt my stray bullet that traveled 200m to give my buddies head a kiss was it? Well turns out it was. Worst TK ive ever done."
WhiteKnightier,"I'd say the one (couple years ago) where I surprised a couple of timmies at factory key exit on factory who were trying to transfer ~750k rubles in a tri-zip.

-WinterSky-,"I didn‚Äôt do this war crime, it happened to me.

I was on my first wipe, maybe level 10 or so. I didn‚Äôt play much PMC but when I would do quest I would try to find some friendly players and let them know I was just questing. I was trying to get into Tarcon‚Äôs(?) office on Custom‚Äôs for a quest and saw 4-5 chad‚Äôs just chilling in there, I should have left but I was not thinking right. I told them I was just trying to finish this quest and wanted to go up to the office. They said they were friendly and were also questing and that I could go up there. I didn‚Äôt get half way up the stairs before they all emptied their mags into me. 
From this day on I don‚Äôt trust PMCs"

Darthalzmaul,"A couple of wipes back I made it my goal to collect one dog tag for every player level. 

My collection got pretty decent but I was missing one of the rarest levels you could find. The level one dog tag.

So I went into the factory  lobby and invited a level one pmc that was looking for a group.

When we loaded in I shouted ""welcome to tarkov"" and blasted my shotgun load into the back of his head.

He had the majority of his beginner stash in his backpack. I got shot on the way out, I felt like I deserved to die. The feeling of guilt set in very quickly. 

I still have nightmares about that raid."

One friend runs out and gets sniped again by the same guy, this time we wait for 10 minutes until my other friend goes out and also gets sniped by the same guy. So I just wait.

&#x200B;

I wait untill there is 10 minutes left in the raid before finally someone starts to walk over to pile of bodies laying in the open. He's taking his time trying to be sneaky moving through bushes and looking around. I watch him for 3 minutes until he lays down on a body to start looting and then instantly shoot him in the leg with a round of M80 blacking it out, he  stands up and I shoot his other leg. He's now standing in the open with two blacked legs and no idea where he's being shot from since i'm using a suppressed DLV. He starts to spray every window and door way he can just firing aimlessly. He then runs out of ammo and just throws his gun on the ground and just stares at the sky. I then come out of the building I was in, slowly walk up to him and he just looks at me. I pull out my Red Rebel and smack him once in the face to finish him off."
ChungusOfAstora,Recently had a group of 4 run past me on streets me and my buddie killed the front runner who turned out to be a level 40 something trying to Sherpa 3 Timmy's who were level 1 (they all had Chad gear on tho level 4 to 5 armor and meta guns I assume he dropped them gear then brought them to streets) anyways after the leader falls they panic like headless chicken and we slowly start to leg them all to death.

CeoOfLighthouse,"Did exactly what OP did but on Customs about a week ago. 5 minutes left in the raid, I'm just about to cross through the wall that leads to ZB-11. I hear shuffling on the other side...... a voip comes across ""Better not come through that wall buddy!""

I respond ""Dude I'm a Scav, let's trade loot!""

He responds ""OK let's do it!""

Comes through and I just blast him with a shotty. He screams "" WHAT THE FUCK DUDE"" over Voip as he's hitting the ground.

I was chuckling all the way to the extract cause I'm sure he thought I was a naughty scav and than saw my name in the death screen ü§£ü§£ü§£"
One_Entrepreneur_181,"I watched a massive war crime on a Trey24k stream. He found a player scav on lighthouse and asked if he would do the co-op extract with him. The player scav agrees and they walk across the whole map together. Trey kills some players and gives the loot to the scav. They get to the extract and with 1 second left on the timer, the scav kills Trey. They were together for like 15 minutes. I was heart breaking to watch."
JanterFixx,"Done none of the crimes. Even spared one guy doing a mission in customs getting an item and needing to extract. He was in the wagon and I shot him once with mosin. He pleaded for life and said stuck on this quest.
I spared him.
I also heading for the extract towards ruaf roadblock so I thought better to go with him rather than rush before him and get shot in back by accident or on purpose... So we go to old gas station.

DafaqYuDoin,"I was playing a factory right before the wipe just practicing with the infinite guns and ammo I could buy. This was amazing for me finishing my second wipe really getting the opportunity to try out a bunch of high level weapons and gear as I never got the opportunity to do so being a poor Timmy all wipe. Killed a dude, then I hear others fighting by gate 0, throw a couple nades (nearly killed myself didn‚Äôt put any near the enemies) before I hear guys on voip screaming there‚Äôs one minute left in the wipe. They sound friendly so I decide to walk over, politely ask them not to kill me. We chat for a while about the end of the raid and I realize that yes the wipe is set to happen literally this minute. Considering I have been on the losing end of 70% of my runs that wipe, I take this opportunity to be the bad guy for once and pop both of these friendly PMC‚Äôs in the face. As I‚Äôm running to gate 3 I disconnect as the wipe has initiated. Felt bad but all my friends on discord watching my steam supported me because I am shit and it was nice to see me be the bad guy for once.

Going from RUAF to Big Red. We run into another 3 man at the train fence. 
 We take out 2 and the last one is in the back by the blue shack. He voice ""I SURRENDER, I SURRENDER""
I hold an angle and yell at him to pull out his melee weapon, aimed at his head. He hesitates staring at the ground. My teammates are coming in at the open fence gate. He still has his weapon out so I tap him in the head. Further investigation showed he didn't have a melee weapon on his body.

My friends asked why I did that when he gave up. My defense was he didn't pull out his melee and I didn't want them to die. I didn't know he didn't have a Melee weapon. If he had complied, we would've let him live

Am I an asshole?

Also always carry a throw away melee weapon"
TuffBastard225,"I stumbled across a PMC in the very south east corner of Woods last wipe. He was prone, hiding behind a bush and very obviously AFK.

Factory, me and two of my friends doing a quest. We run into a duo and find ourselves in a standoff situation. I tell the duo that we just here to do a quest and we should work together on this. One of the two agrees and shows his face and I proceed to make him less alive. The remaining dude from the duo now starts to doubt that I might not be that friendly at all and asks why did I do that. Somehow I managed to assure him that it was not me who shot his friend, it must have been the remaining solo player. He starts to tell me how he has been trying to finish the quest for 5 raids in a row now, and I start to feel bad for him so we decide to exit together. Naturally I shot him in the back while he was opening the door for me.

I asked a guy on Interchange if he still needed Iskra's (as I had one) but he had no mic, so I said if you need it crouch and he started laying down and crouching, then I gave him the Iskra and he jumped around before going to loot, obviously trusting me, a little later I walked up behind him right before he started looting a Toolbox, shot him in the head, looted and all he had was pretty much that one Iskra I gave him, after that, I just left the raid as I felt horrible, did that out of frustration of constantly getting Scav on Scav Violated, nowadays I just shoot no one unless I know it is a PMC, lead scavs around the maps and show them all the good looting spots and have conversations, try to find medicine for wounded ones, quest items for newer ones, etc.

Wildfire788,"This was before VOIP was released... My friend and I are on Customs doing our thing when a hatchling walks up to us. We train our guns on him but he looks at the floor and performs a sort of ""bow"". I toss him a car med kit thinking he'll run off but he follows us through a section of the map. We turn back every few seconds to make sure he wasn't trying anything funny but he followed us like a stray dog.

Just when we decide to keep him, another hatchling runs up to us. This one is quite a bit more hyper, getting in our faces aggressively sometimes but he doesn't go away, so we adopt him as well and continue on.

We engage a scav and kill it, the hatchlings hiding behind us the whole time. We seize the scav's weapon, intending to distribute all loot to the hatchlings later in the raid as we near the extract. 

Inexplicably, a third hatchling suddenly runs up to our group, apparently attracted by the gunfire. He runs around us in circles, stops and looks at our group, then without warning runs up behind my buddy and hits him in the back of the head with a hatchet.

I fire a burst from my AK74 but only one round grazes him and he dives into the group of hatchlings. They all have the default skin and we can't tell them apart. One of the hatchlings, probably the same guy that smacked my buddy (but I couldn't tell), ran up to me and swung at me, narrowly missing and then jumping back into the group to hide amongst them again. By this point the entire group was agitated, running around, trying to get behind us or maybe just away from my gunfire.

""Just shoot them!!"" I yell over discord, and my teammate and I open fire on the group of hatchlings. None of them survived."

So he was surely taking his time he killed every scav and looted every single shit, I was afk behind the pipes near gate extract. And then I hear him coming my way I tabed into the game and there he goes big backpack full of loot, I was like let him go or DO THIS FUCKING THING?

Sir_Kronical,One time I had the Tarkov Shooter quest to get 3 leg shots and 2 headshots. I went to Reserve and posted up under dome with a suppressed SV-98. After waiting a while I saw a Timmy with a pistol and no armor running towards manhole. I shot him in the legs like 4 times and he had no idea where I was. He was clearly panicking and couldn‚Äôt do anything but try to walk away with his crippled legs. I ended him with a shot to the back of the head. I still laugh about that one lol

Right before we extract it was very unfortunate for him that I needed one more headshot pmc kill with a pistol, so I one tapped him in between the eyes, looted his pimped out m4 and armor. I felt like shit for about 5 min until I turned in the quest and was finally done with it."
Royal-Tumbleweed5742,"VOIP had just come out.

Me and my duo were on Reserve, planning to wipe the raiders that spawn in the basement. We split up to cover more ground down there, and I came a across a random that got there before us.

I was still separated from my duo, so I started talking with the guy. He was super chill and we were both talking about how exciting the new VOIP feature was.

My duo was coming down the ramp and tried to shoot him without telling me. The random asks me ‚ÄúDo you know that guy?‚Äù to which I said no. I didn‚Äôt want him to cap me then and there so I had to allow the opportunity for some impromptu team bonding and build trust. 

So me and the random held our ground against my friend, at least that was the plan. My friend was getting his ass kicked by the raiders and the random, so I had no other choice but to kill my new and first friend in VOIP. 

Only I missed the headshot and blacked his thorax instead. He turned to look at me but before he could say or do anything I mag dumped him and watched in horror and awe as my new friends corpse hit the dank dirty floor.

My duo and I still reference that tragedy whenever we have a VOIP experience to this day.

KCH if you‚Äôre reading this, you the homie and sorry I had to bust a cap in your ass.

TLDR; met a cool guy, built a friendship over the raid, killed him anyways but fucked up the headshot and ended up slaughtering the guy."

For the first time in my experience playing tarkov, a pair of friendly PMCs who started VOIPing at us, before he could get more than a few words out I killed him... :( 

Then his buddy killed me and my friend

One day i did scav run, went to extract, meet another scav who had mp-133 and i was like fuck it i Headshot him, picked mp-133 fast, and was runing for my life from ai scavs. i turned in my gun and had one more to go.


Journey lasted for 3 more days until i looked guide how to lvl fast to unlock flea market and i saw you can just buy the guns from prapor and turn them in.

Anyways, my wife and I came up with the idea of using her voice in order to throw people off at there being a woman in tarkov. So we recorded probably around 50 lines which I put onto a soundboard and can play in game. Some examples include ""I'm friendly, please don't kill me."", ""Do you have any salewa kits?"", ""I'm just doing a task."" Its all enough to hold a small conversation with someone. Me and my buddies refer to it as the sirens call.  
  
The most recent use of it was when my 4 stack went to do bunker pt1. We had a pretty decent spawn and rushed the bunker. After we all got the check for it, we heard multiple footsteps getting close. So we setup our angles and here's how the conversation went.  

Sirens Call: Hey.  
Rando: *processes woman*  Hey, how you doin. (Just like joey)  
SC: I'm friendly, please don't kill me.  
R: Thats fine, we're friendly too. What are you doing down here?  
SC: I'm just doing a task.  
R: What task?  
Me: *panicking cause I only have salewa kits on soundboard*  
R: Hello?  
SC: Do you want to join us?  
R: Sure

At this point my buddy determined they'd let their guard down enough and a quick gunfight ensued. We didn't lose a single guy and their three stack was looted. 

Lately I've started to expand my soundboard out more. Adding in things like footsteps, grenade pins, popular songs to sing to and stopping before the chorus. I'm despicable and I know it. As a pmc I will rat in every possible way I can."

Met a Level 54 took some shots at him only to hit his body armor ( was a bit surprised and aim was of). He didn‚Äôt realize from where shots came as his pov was limited by T7. I ran circled around while he was looking for me for him from the side in his head. Next couple raid on that account were too easy with his gear.

ShimadaShimado,"Pre-VOIP, one of my friends decided to invite two randoms to our party at the start of a customs raid, making our usual three-man a five-man. Everything was going swimmingly, and we eventually made our way to dorms. While in two-story, one of the randoms and I were looting a room when he closed the door, leaving the two of us separated from the rest of the team, alone together.

I feared for my life. I thought I was about to get head, eyesed. So, I did what I had to do. I shot first."
Raiju_Lorakatse,Some would for sure say I commited crime because I camped a lot of exfils this wipe already.
carthe292,I have always killed people who were trying to fix the circuit breakers on factory. Never cared what they said.
garack666,Played it
Dizsmo,Last night my buddy and I scavved into reserve and ran down to bunker...raider bodies and pmc...2 scavs were looting but one got startled and shot my buddy then said sorry...after about 15 seconds my buddy iced the guy since he shot first anyways and I smoked his teamate...the AIs didn't attack so I guess it was the right call...and we got a lot of lootüòé
werdrolltfliegt,"Telling scavs there is a pmc in the building only to see they have killed Santa...

After that surely avenging Santa and ratting all the loot"
SaltDotExe,I did the same kind of thing except he was trying to drop meds for me because he thought I was a dying scav lmao
NammiSjoppan,"Did this on factory, my buddy was almost dead from the initial pvp rush. And I hear someone running. I voip him and he voips back saying he‚Äôs a scav, I say I‚Äôm a scav too and tell him to come. At this point my friends panicking telling me he‚Äôs gonna kill us as I spray the dudes face full of lead as he‚Äôs full sprinting towards me with full trust. I felt kinda bad."
De_Salvation,"Something kinda similar, with my two buddies in prison building on streets and I hear a voice outside say ""hey are there any coop exfils here yet I'm a scav!"" I told him yeah scav checkpoint is a coop exfil, we're all PMCs wanna get out of here? He was excited ""yeah I'm gonna pull my knife out and come out even though you're probably just gonna shoot m-
The gunshot echoed through the building and a little part of me died. 

I was down to 256 roubles and on my last kit, couldn't take the chance."
dropkicked_eu,"My scav karma is through the floor this wipe‚Ä¶ 


I flash banged Santa. Then panic shot him. Then watched him bleed out"
Marvins-Room,"I met a guy at tunnel spawn doing fishing gear on shoreline and advised him to wait a few minutes to plant whilst people make their way to resort and I had to go shoot scavs in my UN TAR armor and wished him luck. 

Easiest shooter born Iv ever done."
1mperia1,"Day before wipe me and a scav fought like 4 STACKED PMC's to the point i could barely even walk, it felt sketch because he kept aiming at my head and refused to go without me, as soon as i got through the door to extract he aimed at my head and i shot him, i lost sleep on that one ngl."
ImaginaryAI,[I did it because everyone on the sub was bitching about betrayals](https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/xaefvv/heard_you_guys_like_friendly_voip_interactions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
skuggabarn,i have committed some warcrimes.
Traditional-Monk4098,Trapped player scavs in one exits rooms with my body and tell them they have a choice to make.
ipinesol,"I was scaving on customs when  I ran into another scav who killed 3-4pmcs. He's chill and lets me loot some of the bodies. Scav 3 enters, gets some of the loot, and scav 1 leaves for extract. Scav 3 and and I have the same extracts and head that way. Just before we get there, he is like here take this. Throws pgw at my feet. I threw him a cheese and said, take this. He looks at it and says I don't need that. I reply, you will. Shoot him in the head, take all his good stuff, and get out."
Slopster53,"Fun story happened just last night‚Ä¶ two buds and I are on Reserve as a three man scav team.  One of my buds finds and befriends a juiced PMC three man, convincing them to take the scav extract.  Myself and my other bud set up to camp the extract, myself on the gun emplacement overlooking Ks on the second floor of school.  Long story short, we killed all 3 PMC, but two of us died in the process.  Our third bud (and the rest of the player scavs on the map) scooped the loot and made it out.  

Don‚Äôt ever trust player scavs as a pmc!"
PotatoTwo,"Scav on Lighthouse last wipe, peacefully making my way through town, see another player scav go into one of the houses, and I VoIP to him and announce my presence. He shot me through a window, breaking a leg, so I took cover in the shed, kept talking to him and didn't shoot back. Eventually I was able to talk him down and make peace, so I asked if he had a splint for my leg he broke, and when he pulled up his inventory to check I killed him. I wouldn't have been violent had he not started it, but I do feel a tiny bit bad about the trickery."
itz_ayz,"Going into night raid on woods, just to run around and level my endurance, with no gear just a pistol to protect me just in case, run trough whole map, looted here and there, come to close to car extract, and heard some shoots. See that one pmc is trying to extract, i sneak to him, manage to land a head shot, take all his fucking gear with all the good loot he found, i literally made like a milli from all his things i stole, i felt soo bad he had like 30 seconds before he could extract, i didn't even have to pay for the ride lmaoooo."
ReneLevesque,"On my way to extract at Admin Gate and a scav was just done looting the bush stash by the wall. At that point in time I did not know that this bush hid a stash and Mr Timmy looked very sus as he was looking at me trying to get himself out of the bush.

A couple Hunter shots did the job.

He was pretty fat too."
CameronSquida,Killed Santa two raids in a row.
kaibtw,"Early in one wipe I was on the hunt for usecs for friend from the west and I was only killing bears for the longest time.. I think it was when voip first came out. Friends and I went to interchange and we spawned power.. I found my last graphics card I needed and I was like""I'm just getting out i need this.. ""  we decide to take the car but needed to wait so I didnt get a run through. I hear someone sprinting to the car and he sees us and says he's just trying to get out and didn't want to fight. I say OK and walk up and dome him and leave with my graphics card. He was a usec. I completed two quests.

I'm so sorry. I had to do it. I had to complete the quest and all I could find was bears!"
Thatoneirish,"I gave meds and gained the trust of a scav on shoreline as a scav myself- the man was carrying a ton I could tell.

When he was hungry? I fed him

When he was dehydrated I dropped him some apple juice.

He didn‚Äôt know the way to road to customs, so I had gained his trust and lead him to northern fence, and after using him like a mule, and giving a fake name when he asked to be my friend, put him down"
RadioWav3_Gaming,"I‚Äôm a relatively new player but the actions I committed were truly vile.

Loaded into a streets scav run hoping to grab some loot and head out.

Load into a game and quickly meet a fellow scav who seemed new and decide to spend the whole run looting together. 

At this point we must have been looting for over 20 minutes when I lie to him that I also have sewer extract. 

Right as he is about to extract, I blew his face in only to hear his screams for a quick second before he was sent to the starting screen again. 

This was around 3am in the morning so I can only imagine that he immediately logged off for the night with the chance of never returning to the game again.

Really made me question some life choices."
SovietVillageBoy,Honestly blasting fully kitted scavs on Lighthouse thinking they're PMC. I feel so bad cuz I know what it's like to have 4 guns on you armor helmet headset bag full of tech loot and then as you come down the steps from water you just get blasted by a player Scav.
PR9DY,I was doing a scav on lighthouse with one of my buddys i was in the middle of the camp while he was in building one and a couple pmcs rushed him I saw one and killed him before my buddy died but their was another I couldn‚Äôt see so he died. I walked up to camp the stairs to get revenge and I ended up killing the guy so that was 2 pmc‚Äôs down so I though I was safe too loot so I looted the guy I just killed and I heard someone say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a scav‚Äù so I said ‚Äútheirs some loot ontop of the building‚Äù and got shot in the back. I figured out it was a pmc in the loading screen.
SgtSundae,"Killed a naked guy for a shooter born quest..

Jaguaralfa,"I like to dress us as a scav, make friends with player scav(s) and go through a whole raid together with them. Then I'll shoot them in the head with a silenced pistol when they're not looking."
Several_Promise_4528,"Perfidy (false surrender with the intent to kill) I still usually die but that is in fact an actual war crime that I have actually committed in EFT, but it has succeeded a few times so it still kinda works I guess"
SlaveNumber23,"During my first wipe I did a raid one time with my friends when I was completely bankrupt and I would basically go in naked and run ahead of the group voiping ""hey I'm a naked hatched runner I'm friendly don't shoot me!"" at whoever I came across to basically scout them out and lower their guard for my heavily armed squad of friends. 
  
Came across a lone PMC who shot me at first but after voiping to him that I was friendly and waving my axe around he was like ""oh shit sorry"" and let me go. I said ""that's okay, man"" as my squad of chads round the corner and full auto him to death like a firing squad."
