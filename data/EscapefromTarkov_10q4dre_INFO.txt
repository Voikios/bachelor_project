{"Title": "Slowing progression by making me run labs and shoreline 50 times back to back while buying for 6 million in keys for a ledx is stupid and destroys my enjoyment of this game.", "Post Text": "I have not found a single ledx. I have:\n\n* Black keycard visited over 15 times.\n* Taped key Visited over 10 times\n* West 301 visited over 25 times\n* East 226 visited over 25 times\n* East 328 visited over 25 times\n* West 104, 112 and east 107. guess. 25 times.\n* Rushed all loose loot spawns on labs over 20 times\n* Looted every single medical bag in west and east wing lower floors over 25 times.\n\nIf you want to slow progression down then maybe add more enjoyable quests instead of this stuff making me dead inside.\n\nEdit: also because people do not seem to be aware: you need to finish the private clinic quest to be able to get to the lightkeeper questline. Meaning: *You have to find a ledx to later on being able to craft one.* I am forced to play against gaming chairs on labs if I want to do lightkeeper stuff.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nSince making this post I have ran labs 5 more times. The fifth time, not one, **BUT TWO LEDX.** Ofcourse we instantly get pushed by a five-man where I managed to kill one and instantly run towards no backpack extract. Every time you complain the tarkov gods hear you and they deliver.\n\nEdit 3: 6th run labs another ledx. lol.", "ID": "10q4dre", "Score": 1104, "Total Comments": 497, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10q4dre/slowing_progression_by_making_me_run_labs_and/"}
