It\u2019s ok, you just don\u2019t realize that the skill gap is higher than you know.\n\nI\u2019m top 250, have probably 200+ hours and have learned a thing or two. \n\nYesterday I got a 7 kill then 5 kill game back to back. After both I realized I probably got reported by at least one person. \n\nBut, what happened was I realized the players weren\u2019t the greatest, and I knew where they\u2019d go, what angles they are likely holding, and usually knew what gun they had. I then used that info along with audio, to kill them quite efficiently. \n\nGood players recognize bad players, and then do what good players do to bad players. Eventually it feels easy, factoring gunplay improves with time just as much as game sense. \n\nJust because a guy \u201cknows exactly where you\u2019re at\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s walling. But rather that\u2019s he\u2019s probably just better \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\nIt\u2019s discouraging to see all the cheating allegations when in reality most of the time it\u2019s bad players learning the hard way. Scares off new players, and hurts the game too much", "ID": "10ekv90", "Score": 40, "Total Comments": 58, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/10ekv90/theres_not_as_many_cheaters_as_youd_think/"}
