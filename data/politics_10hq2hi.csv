WomanWhoWeaves,I want to know who paid his debts.
jiggamahninja,Anyone remember when Brett Kavanaugh blamed Hillary Clinton for the mounting sexual assault allegations against him? Good times!
Agitated-Tadpole1041,Donald fucking Trump got to pick 3 SC justices. This country is such bullshit. The minority rule the majority.
PicardTangoAlpha,Lol photo. Needs to be a t shirt.
wave-garden,"This is about Brett Kavanaugh, the rapist on SCOTUS?"
ganymede_boy,">... after Kavanaugh stuck his naked member in [her] face, he went to the bathroom and was egged on by classmates to make himself erect; once he’d succeeded in that task, he returned to harass [her] some more.

I bet one of those 'classmates' was [Donkey Dong Doug.](https://youtu.be/VRJecfRxbr8?t=157)"
Scorpion1024,"I continue to believe the accusers. What I saw in those confirmation hearings was not sincere denial, it was pure narcissistic rage with self pity sprinkled on top. The fact that he vowed revenge as he was being sworn in should have put instant brakes on it.."
DadinDenver,Read the article. This puts substance behind the allegations that surfaced in 2018.
InevitableAvalanche,"Republicans are the ones who protect groomers and pedophiles. They elect them and let them lead. Dems toss disgusting folks like this out.

Conservatives have no standards."
sunnydaysahead2022,"The fact we have known sexual assaulters on our Supreme Court makes me know that no women are safe. 

Women’s rights are going to keep being assaulted. 

The Republicans have the Supreme Court. We will all suffer because of it."
squishbot3000,"4,500 messages sent to the FBI. His nomination and appointment is stain on our country and indicative of everything the GOP stands for."
tandoori_taco_cat,">Stier says he was told that, after Kavanaugh stuck his naked member in Ramirez’s face, he went to the bathroom and was egged on by classmates to make himself erect; once he’d succeeded in that task, he returned to harass Ramirez some more.

I will never understand how people like Trump, Kavanaugh and Thomas can ascend to the highest positions in the land, but somehow Hillary is literal Satan for having an email server."
expatdo2insurance,"It was obvious during his confirmation he was inarguably and overwhelmingly guilty.

Of course there's more.

Conservatives just don't care about facts, morality, or the good of the country."
bengalfan,"A rapist, an insurrectionist and a misogynistic walk into the bar..."
Lucifersmile,And still nothing will be done
DemiMini,He treats these events as badges of honor. He and sqeee have a shared calendar that they use to remember them by.
mangoserpent,"In the Brent K era frats and athlete parties were often known to be pretty rapey. Most women I know of that age had at least a few college party experiences with those two groups that swung from kind of uncomfortable let's get out of here to being traumatized.

Because there was no technology then and it was easy to "" lose"" somebody at a bigger party my core group had a leave nobody behind code. I think a lot of women did in that era. It was the only protection and if something happened nobody would believe you and ask what you were wearing or how drunk you were.

Tons of women did not report their SA or rape in that era, very common."
JonesinforJonesey,They all knew he was guilty and confirmed him anyway because he could further their anti abortion agenda.  That fucking hypocrisy was so hard to watch - even from Canada.
sunnydaysahead2022,"He was a serial sexual assaulter. 

And he voted to take rights away from women. 

I’m shocked."
StrangerAtaru,Would be interesting if one party cared about ethics like the other does and the Supreme Court wasn't just declaring kings.
walker1555,"Kavanaugh's expression in the photo is hilarious. 

It's the ""How dare you!"" expression that the entitled make when someone they view as inferior tries to hold them accountable."
Thetimmybaby,"When the GOP sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people"
chriskavon,Matt Damon’s impression of him on SNL is still priceless tho
Kayin_Angel,"Remember, while we all watched him lie about being a rapist, he cried thinking about his dad and his calendar as if they were some kind of memories of his passed father, but his dad was just sitting right there?  Piece of shit."
excessive_brutality,"i can't believe this chucklefuck is on the supreme court of the united states

this country is so fucked"
Svataben,"Tell me again how rape allegations ruin men's lives.

No, seriosly, tell me that this rapist is finally going down!"
Deconratthink,FBI and Trump elevating and protecting a rapist. This stuff just never ends for women.
UpsetEquivalent9713,"That face brings it all back. All women have a story about a predatory man and a man that was supposed to protect her and didn’t believe. I’ve seen this played out a hundred times. But to see it happen in broad daylight at the highest level in the country was heartbreaking, infuriating and frightening. I honestly wasn’t angry when Roe vs Wade was overturned. I wasn’t even surprised. That day when Kavanaugh showed his disgust that a woman would have the audacity to call him on his bad behavior and there was no repercussions showed me that this country is not a safe place for women."
bisskits,And nothing will come of it.
Niastri,"Kavanaugh could record a snuff film where he murdered a woman, mug for the camera, then post it to his personal Twitter account, and still only about four Republicans would vote to remove him from the Supreme Court."
quesadilla79,remember when it turned out the FBI ignored thousands of tips received on him
TheEffinChamps,"A family member of mine knew him when he was a teenager, as they went to the same highschool.

Let's just say they weren't surprised at all by the accusations, as there apparently was a history with this guy even in high school."
Vbuyjftjb,"Sick sick, disgusting example to send our children that this would be acceptable or allowed by the highest in the court and in the Country. Just a damn embarrassment"
JohnBsGhost,His reaction during the hearing should have been enough. No one that can’t control themselves in the public eye deserves it.
Kuronekosmom,"Kavanaugh is a sexual predator. Alito is a liar. Thomas is a meat puppet of his wife. Barrett's resume is too thin to get preside over a traffic court, let alone be a SCOTUS justice and Roberts has clearly demonstrated that he can't exert any control over the previously named.

&#x200B;

This is why electing Democrats is so damned important."
YugeTraxofLand,So glad this predator has a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the country
MattPayneWrestler,"Everyone is innocent until proven guilty, but ya know, if someone has a bunch of allegations against them even mcdonalds would avoid hiring them. I guess the supreme court of the united states isn’t so picky for choosing their judges eh🙄"
Adulcettone,Remember when he cried like a spoiled little child when he thought he wasn't getting his way?
Ok-Faithlessness1679,Ah the old republican rapist.  Popping up every where.
Agitated-Tadpole1041,2 of the 9 SC justices are rapist.
lenchoreddit,"This privileged asshole is set for life. If nothing came of it before he became justice, there is ZERO chance now."
feignapathy,"It's scary that this is 1 of 9 people who gets the final word on what freedoms and rights we have. 

Just look at the anger in his eyes. Not the anger at himself for what he did, but the anger at the women who dared to expose his violent past."
godel32,We have at least one Rapist and one insurrectionist pretending to be judges on the supreme fascist court. Does anyone take them seriously anymore?
Yokepearl,American catholic conservatives are mainly a cult of hatred that weakens america
Pale-Worldliness7007,He’s a GOP appointed Supreme Court Judge. Nothing more needs to be said.
mkt853,Are there any conservatives who aren't total dirt bags? That's a question the world wants answered.
LoveVirginiaTech,"Face it, we're all boofed"
jimjoebob,"for the record, ""boofing"" is a portmanteau of the letters ""B. F."", which stand for ""butt fucking"". It was a ""thing"" that douchey males in the 80's would say all the time. source: I looked up to older, douchey males at that time and heard that term a LOT."
vacuous_comment,"I guess it is good we are getting a deeper dive into this. 

One weird aspect of this is that completely ignoring the sexual assault, rape and such, his performance n the hearing should have disqualified him right there and then.  It really shows the utter dishonesty of the theocratic right wing extremists when they insist on regressive and archaic decorurm (on their terms) in many venues and then go for this utterly unfit man-baby."
cakeand314159,"Correct me if I’m wrong, so we now officially have *two* sex pests on the supreme court?"
itsallaboutfantasy,Well this is what happens when the FBI doesn't investigate any of the tips that they received. Who paid off all his debts?
fierceindependence23,"Not, ""New,"" just the credible allegations the FBI completely ignored and didn't investigate."
AnalSoapOpera,We have an illegitimate Supreme Court. Obama got a seat stolen and we had Republicans rushing in 2 justices with Kavanaugh and never actually investigated his sexual allegations or his financial allegations and Amy Barrett who was rushed in and was in a religious cult. Clarence Thomas’ Wife was involved in January 6th and storming the Capitol And they all have lifetime seats and will control us for as long as we live. We are fucked.
KevinAnniPadda,"""Most damning of all, it features a never-heard-before audio recording made by one of Kavanaugh’s Yale colleagues—Partnership for Public Service president and CEO Max Stier—that not only corroborates Ramirez’s charges, but suggests that Kavanaugh violated another unnamed woman as well."""
iuytrefdgh436yujhe2,Al Franken resigned because a joke photo looked bad
omaroama,"Ever cross your mind that the whole sexual predator show was a distraction to prevent anyone focusing on his time with Bush. Bush was willing to provide the documentation. This man was responsible for our government committing war crimes. Torture of prisoners of war was justified by the honorable Kavanaugh. Instead of being charged with war crimes, he was confirmed as a Supreme. 

Yes, being a sexual predator is sick. 

But he was responsible for our troops turning Abu Graab into a chamber of horrors. 

Are there still enlisted men and women serving time for following his legal opinions? 

We didn’t even demand to see a single document. 

Not one. We let this legal mind off the hook, knowing what he had done. 

“Waterboarding is not torture” Kavanaugh sits on the Supreme Court. How can you act surprised at anything else he’s done or said knowing that? 

At Nuremberg they hung people for less."
Thirdlight,"So how many more raped women have to come forward for everyone to figure out it won't do shit.  This is what happens when you have money and power.  NOTHING!
You can rape away and get away with it.  Yall up in here acting like jack shit will change."
robpensley,"I don’t know which one can make an uglier face, Cavanaugh, or Lindsey Graham."
grateful_todd,What a piece of shit
lennybird,"Could have had someone like Merrick Garland who at one time had bipartisan support no less...

Instead we get a frat bro with many red flags."
justanormalchat,He’s a well known rapist but that’s cool with the conservatives since he fits right in
LouSputhole94,"Honey get in here, new Kavanaugh rape accusation just dropped!"
Explodedhamster, Well if we had a proper investigation from the beginning maybe this wouldn't be an issue
strtjstice,Thank you for the image. Should be the only one used for that rapist
eoThica,Another republican? Shocker
Zoklett,I just want the say the pictures journalists have been using lately are awesome
Gingerberry92,That picture of him is hilarious
Towniemania,">Stier states that he knows this tale “first-hand,” and that the young woman in question did not subsequently remember the incident, nor did she want to come forward after she’d seen the vile treatment that Ford and Ramirez were subjected to by the public, the media, and the government. 

Did she not remember it or refuse to come forward? Was she going to come forward about something she didn't remember? This makes no sense."
SuperstarTraxRecords,Well at least he’s no appointed for life for anything
