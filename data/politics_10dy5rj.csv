Dang, this is a terrorist cell."
409024072546630,"‘Pena’s candidacy came under scrutiny over the summer when Garcia filed a court challenge to disqualify him because he had been convicted in 2008 of stealing large amounts of goods from several big box retail stores in a reported “smash and grab” scheme.’

The number of straight up criminals running as GOP politicians is growing exponentially. 

It’s like criminals are able to recognize each other and flock together."
FirmestSprinkles,"if the country was saner, this would have been the biggest fucking news."
Madhavaz,"A republican using violence against his political opponents? I'm shocked and appalled. Okay... maybe not shocked. But I am especially appalled at this:

>On Jan. 3, shots rang out at state Rep. Linda Lopez’s home and three bullets went through her daughter’s bedroom as the 10-year-old slept.

I have a 10-year old daughter. I cannot imagine her screaming as bullets fly into her bedroom. These are terrorists."
table_fireplace,"Also an election denier:

>Pena lost the election by more than 3,600 votes, garnering 2,033 votes to Garcia’s 5,679.

>In frequent postings on his Twitter account, Pena, 39, has maintained that he didn’t lose and that the election was rigged."
Quiet_Dimensions,Literally the definition of terrorism.
1Sluggo,I can’t wait to see how republicans fault Hunter Biden’s laptop for this.
honestmango,"I’m glad they caught this fucker. I remember reading a story at the time where 4 D politicians in a close geographic area had multiple rounds shot through their front doors. 

The gist of the article was the police were “trying to determine if the incidents were connected.”

*facepalm*"
decalod85,Republican terrorist.

oakstave,Terrorist attack. This was a GOP terrorist attack.
Benni_Shoga,“Legitimate Political Discourse”
bk15dcx,"This is normal now.

There will be no outrage nor condemnation from the GOP, and many will support and defend this behavior, advancing and normalizing this type of political terrorism for future candidates."
fox-mcleod,It’s fucking crazy how small a story this is.
Seraphynas,"I remember when the story about these shootings was posted here and when people drew the obvious conclusion they were met with:

“It might not even be politically motivated”.

“You’re jumping to conclusions that fit your narrative”.  

And now, what say you?"
salazarraze,This is what it takes these days to convince Republican voters that you aren't a RINO.
Balgat1968,How about attempted murder?  Tonight ABQ news reported that three shots went into the daughter’s bedroom in which she was sleeping. Remember when one of the reasons our Nation went to war in Vietnam was that the Viet Cong were assassinating elected officials and judges? Went to war.
PM_Me_Your_Sidepods,">“APD essentially discovered what we had all feared and what we had suspected — that these shootings were indeed politically motivated,

Call what it is. This is an act of domestic terrorism."
BrutalOutThere,American conservatism is a death cult

Less than two months later Pena lost the November election by more than 3,600 votes — garnering 2,033 votes to Garcia’s 5,679.

Over 2000 people voted for a convicted criminal who'd spent 7 years in prison!

I'm sure some of them knew and didn't care. But I'm also sure some of them just voted for everybody with an R next to their name on the ballot. Neither one of those things is OK!"

Can't wait to see em projecting and framing their republican crimes on mexicans"
baddfingerz1968,"The vast majority of violent, politically motivated crimes are committed by disturbed individuals with far right orientations, yet the right constantly lies through their teeth and attempts to blame these heinous crimes, like mass shootings, on the left. Look at the statistics."
Alarm-Will-Sound,"It’s fucked up how this is the new normal. And of course no condemnation from the GQP because this guy represents their base. The right is absolutely off the fucking rails. I thought maybe a violent, failed coup would be the breaking point, but nope, the rightward lunge toward full on fascism continues unchecked."
tracerhoosier,He still claims he didn't lose and the 2022 election was fraudulent.
EddyBuddard,Terrorist piece of shit.
AimlesslyCheesy,Is this why they're pro 2nd amendment?
all_of_the_lightss,These types of things are directly a result of normalizing Trump and his terrorist behavior.
,He used the small bowl for his haircut.
skazzzz4,He'll become the next Kyle Rittenhouse. The right will worship him as an American hero.
DarkAngel900,"""Let this be a warning to all Democrats! Stop running for offices! "" <Solomon Pena *probably*"
thr33pwood,"As a foreigner looking at this from Germany, the radicalization of the GOP is worrying. 
At first it was just a few ""tea party"" weirdos, but since Trump and the storm on the Capitol there seems to be a lot of fascist tendencies in the republican party. 

Because rejecting the rules of democracy itself, like not accepting a lost election and threatening violence against your political opponents is a straight way into fascism."
Asleep_Bet,"The past 4 GOP Presidents: 
1: Trump
2 Bush Jr
3: Bush Sr.
4: Reagan 
What is there to be proud of anymore? For the past 50 years the republican party has been synonymous with blood thirst."
Donald_Morton,A member of the GOP orchestrating targeted shootings at Democratic politicians homes? I'm shocked! What kind of kool-aid do Republicans drink?
thefanciestcat,">The suspect, Solomon Pena, is a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for office in November, has made repeated claims that the election was rigged and appears to have attended the Jan. 6, 2021, riot in Washington, D.C.

staticchmbr,"""a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for office in November, has made repeated claims that the election was rigged and appears to have attended the Jan. 6, 2021, riot in Washington, D.C.""

hmm, that sounds a bit familiar.. so, what they are saying is that maybe, just MAYBE, the criminal charges for insurrectionists and the orange muppet in charge of them should get going?"
firdahoe,This guy campaigned door-to-door in my neighborhood and I had a 2 min conversation with him. It was obvious from those 2 min that he was not altogether right in the head !nd at one point he was just rambling. Definitely can't say I am surprised.
Superman0X,"This is a classic example of what conservatives mean when they say 'The second amendment is for when the first fails.' If they can not get control by lying and cheating, they will try to take it by force."

penny-wise,See what this election denial shit has gotten us??
Domena100,I wonder what the conservative subreddit has to say about that.
SaladAssKing,"You know, personally, when I disagree with someone’s politics I try to talk with them first. If they are entrenched in their ideology I leave them be and move one. Why is it that people think it is okay to shoot at someone because you differ from them politically? These kinds of people are sick or brainwashed. It has to be either of these two. Both are terrible."
Campaign-Tough,Republican terrorists attacking America
Roook36,Republicans are crooks and terrorists.  Anyone still supporting that party hates their country
The_REAL_McWeasel,"Ya gotta loveit .........today's GOP.   Election denier........loses his own election by a LANDSLIDE and refuses to concede, because it was all rigged......so let's hire some thugs to go shoot up the homes of democrats-

s_ox,"I wonder when they are going to have their ""are we the baddies?"" moment..."
xeonicus,"Remember when Republicans doubted it was politically motivated?  Yeah... we all remember.  Turns out it was far worse than we thought.  Now far-right politicians are hiring hitmen to assassinate opponents.  

And let's not forget House Republican Leader Ryan Lane's non-apology and attempt to spin this to his advantage in a seeming attempt to promote gun rights and ""blame criminals"".  Not the time for your rhetoric bro.  

What Republicans need to do is distance themselves from criminals.  They've increasingly done the opposite in the last few years."

RevB1983,"Just another run of the mill, everyday Republican. If you vote R currently and see this, know this is what you vote for. Know this is what represents you. Know this is what you are. Terrorists. Domestic, home grown terrorists. And you don't get to say ""but it isn't all R's"" because these people represent the party. These are the people R's are putting into office, so it is ALL R's.
