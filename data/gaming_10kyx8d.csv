DarkREX217,"(Very excitedly) F*** yeah! You go girl. F*** yeah!


I don't know why I got so excited. Your outfit looks amazing. Maybe it's the energy you captured in this shot? Or maybe the character Tina herself just lends itself to that high energy vibe? What ever it is, you look great!"
Staffordmeister,Oh hi
ImBackYetAgainBitch,"Not so tiny, but nailed the art style"

MDF87,Katy Perry?!
Lasair86,Hey so I have a gaming question and I don't know if it fits in here but since you cosplayed as tiny Tina you could tell me whether or not I should get the new tiny Tina's wonderland?
IforgotwhatIwasdoing,I think you need more lines to fill out the 'drawn' cartoonish look. But the neck/lips and bandaid look fantastic. So does the rest of the getup. Very impressive it's handmade.
ReneStrike,Katy Perry?
