ShredForTheLord,from the eft discord: Interface volume will be adjusted with a small hotfix in few hours
WouterrDitt,Every bullet in the mag is -1% hearing IRL now.
noqio,Yeah just went on here to make sure it wasnt just me. I legit cannot stand how ear piercing it is to loot now - especially the experience notification.
Crimie1337,Another job well done
deadd0g,this needs a lot of upvotes. im so glad they're fixing stuff but i'm not exaggerating when i say i don't want to play while this bug is there. packing a 60 rounder is so painfully loud and i pretty much can't hear anything else while doing it - very frustrating.
loongod5,sounds like a skill issue
Chiseledcactus,"More specifically, it happens with loot interactions, or loot movement in-raid. You can hear the audio fix itself when you exit the interface/inventory menu, but it also bugs out if you grab loose loot"
sixnb,"***EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***

**SORRY, WHAT? YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO SPEAK UP, I CANT HEAR YOU OVER THE TINNITUS**"
IAMBUDE,"Honestly, this is just another testament to the fact that the devs do not test their shit at all. It's so obvious that no one even bothered to load into even a simple offline game and play a round to see if the sound still works."
Gul_Dukatr,"yea i just did my first raid after the patch and OMG my ears are bleeding, i played with interface sounds off for years now and i can't go back"
fdykn,"Still here after ""Fix"""

FelixTheCuteTrap,just also made a post about this. it seems its louder when you have a headset on
StillOutOfMind,It's not a minor issue. With in game headset on its unbearable.
Neither_Version4821,Have the same issue really annoying
Netmeister,"Mine is still low in stash, full volume in raid."
djmd1,So this basically proves they do zero testing on their patches right? Because how was this not immediately noticed?
thesketchyvibe,Par for the course.
attomsk,Is there any testing involved in their development cycle ? It feels like zero testing is done
FaithlessnessDeep492,This is part of the Russian psyop operation to destroy the hearing of the western world
mk394,"As a dev myself, I don't understand how they manage to introduce those kind of bugs in the current state of the game"
Scarity,"holy shit its so loud wtf is this, the looting XP sound actually hurts my ears"
UrAnacondaGirlfriend,"this.

please fix, right now."
Chargers4L,You guys wanted realism? Now you have to wear ear pro or get tinnitus.
FaithlessnessDeep492,Let me know when this is fixed so I can actually play lol
gReivStone,"When wearing comtac's or other headphones, all the interface noises get amplified 100%... very annoying too loot containers or load up mags... Fix this please! :)"
chillybawls,"We have the greatest devs, probably the best. No devs are better, really."
Gart-traG,and some people still deny that this game is just a bunch of spaghetti code put together
dominikozi,How can you miss a bug that is obvious for every single player after like 5 minutes of their first raid of the patch. Pathetic
famousbymonring,sounds like a skill issue. /S
jd52995,Turn down your overall volume. I promise you don't need to have it up that loud to hear footsteps. You're just blowing your ears out with gunshots.
Weird-Butterscotch55,"Man they’re actually tryna fix their game and make it better and y’all really just bitching and bitching, not specifically op but everyone else just complaining like they didn’t just release one of the best patches they’ve ever done"
Sad_Week9076,"Wonder if we can modify this in the game/config files. I'll check later on, it was crazy loud earlier thought I was imagining shit"
Clam70,Same problem here
Crepeas,Same
XAMpew,They better hotfix this today. The audio is so loud I cant play. Tested in offline after seeing this thread.
Healthy-Air3755,Me too
KoreanThighLover,Can confirm :(
Subtronaut,"Yeah, some interface interactions are like a jet engine to the ear"
ScumWithBoundaries,Set all volume settings to max and then turn your headset volume down temporarily? They gotta fix this though
poohbear_theOriginal,The nad how about the oculus audio? Still leaks memory and drains frames ?
morklonn,Turn it off
BasicDope,It does not matter how low volume one have. These sounds are made to rape ears...
tacticoolman,ok thanks for this because i thought i was going insane
oske2,It's fucking obnoxious not going to lie
FaithlessnessDeep492,"Soundlock and lower the game volume, you'll be fine"
Rickety-Cricks,Sorry? I can’t hear you through 127dB looting xp
learnchangelive,"Use an equalizer like apo + peace and find a config for your headset. You'd be amazed what happens. 

Had to do this before the audio update because unsuppressed m4s were so loud to me for some reason."
greencurrycamo,"safety, always off"
Unlmtdglass,I came here to post the same thing lol hopefully fixed soon
AnyRevolution24,"I got no sound whatsoever after the patch.. The game says it can't find my microphone aswell.  
Not muted in volume mixer, checked my sound settings, everything is the same as before, nothing has changed but I can't get sound in tarkov, halp"
straight_lurkin,"Immediately noticed and wanted to never search a filing cabinet again lmao I couldn't hear myself think between the rolling of the drawes, the searching sound, the xp sounds, the loot sounds, the quest dings, and item moving sounds lolnot to mention the gunshots and grenades exploding"
Oknamehere_4980,"Ok I was getting annoyed how load filing cabinets were, at least everyone is at a equal disadvantage. Kinda makes me realize how big of a advantage I have over others when I'm playing now though.

For any new player questioning what I mean when you lower your interface volume looting noises become quieter allowing you to hear footsteps better, I hope more new people learn this so it doesn't get them killed (or battlestate just makes it equal to everyone, I'm just autistic as shit and hate repetitive loud noises)"
Mightypeon-1Tapss,My ears are bleeding when loading mags u/kixilay
Bacch,"Yeah, this hasn't been fixed.  Repacking a mag sounds like I have the mag pressed up against my ear while doing it."
Penis_Bees,"I'm here for getting rid of the slider, because there was zero reason in the meta for having anything but zero. But yeah 25% would have been nice"
HavelDad,"Unironically, literally unplayable"
V4ALIANT,"yep, still broken."
HatchedC,"Still broken, well atleast the menus sounds are fixed but still that tinnitus ringing CLICK CLICK CLICK and moving grenades or ammo in your inventory. Especially with headset on. I have enough ear damage, I don't need more....."
Burmania,Still loud as shit for me in raid :(
MapReasonable5265,Ya it jumps to max but will fade back to normal levels.
preyforkevin,You just gotta download the ninja mod. Problem solved.
