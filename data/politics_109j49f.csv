Fynn_the_Finger,"What he wants to say: ""Fuck off, I need his vote."""
Madhavaz,"When you are defending a grifting, lying conman then you have made a wrong turn in life. But for McCarthy this has been his choice since 2015. He's got plenty of practice."
JonathanDP81,"""The important thing is that he voted for me."""
regice112,"""That fragile republican majority lead is more important than ethics ""

- McCarthy probably"
AnonAmbientLight,"Republicans are craven. They’ll gladly take someone as unethical and compromised as Santos if it helps them keep their majority. 

They don’t care about you. They don’t care about me. 

They only care about maintaining power at all costs. 

This is the modern GOP."
Try040221,"Didn't Santos impersonated McCarthy's aids to solicit campaign donation?

That means George Santos indirectly stole from McCarthy.

But even that is a OK?

Santos through his Russian handlers must have something really big on McCarthy...."
briendoesitallbad,Reps love liars and grifters.
Squirrel_Chucks,Adk McCarthy what Santos' legal name is. The moment he hesitates and has to think about it will show he really DOES think Santos is radioactive poison but CANT afford to lose him
Godofwar-2,So why did the fucking reporters say that to him? I don't understand reporters now a days. Hell yes there is charges against him and he's under criminal investigation. I would just ask McCarthy why do you support lying criminals and welcome them into your party.
NegaDeath,"""Ok, but is he under *four* criminal investigation?

Checkmate, Liberals."""
qpgmr,"We had this happen in my state. The GOP had a tiny majority and one guy got massively drunk and tried kicking in the door of a female aide to ""party"". When that failed, he actually called the cops and demanded they open her door because of ""an important meeting"".

The GOP sent him off to a clinic to dry out, got him a haircut & suit, and blocked any ethics charges against him - all to ensure they could maintain majority (which, btw, they never really did anything with).

The aide wouldn't work with the DA's office on charges, so they ended up being dropped.  I think she got a no-show job with the party on top of continuing to be an aide (assigned to another office)."
Spare_Substance5003,How do you get so addicted to power that you can't even understand basic right and wrong? McCarthy is basically selling his soul at this point and I don't even believe in a soul.
CaptainNoBoat,">“In America today, you’re innocent till proven guilty. So just because somebody doesn’t like the press you have, it’s not me that can oversay what the voters say.”

Already admitting a criminal charge isn't the bar. He'd have to go through a lengthy trial and be sentenced, evidently.

And let's face it - there is no bar.

Even though this is not a court of law, but a *JOB*, and removal is akin to being fired, McCarthy will keep him as long as he provides a +1 for his historically dysfunctional majority caucus - regardless of any circumstances.

If George Santos could vote from prison, McCarthy would keep him."
jwr1111,Here I thought Jim Jordan was the master of looking the other way...
Hehateme123,"Ok I disagree… Im not sure how big a story this is around the US/world. I’m currently in NYC area and the story is huge. Here is the thing… there is a good possibility he is a foreign agent. He all the sudden came across a huge amount of cash of unknown origin.

He’s likely a Russian Manchurian candidate. My prediction is he will be arrested in the next month."
Spice_Alter,"No wonder they gutted the ethics committee.

Disembowlment is their definition of moral. Which is to say they have 0 moral compass. 

Fuck republicans"
fowlraul,"He meant any *new* charges as of January 11, 2023. 🤷‍♂️"
kukukap,"Why is it almost always that a loud republican anti Pedo guy turns out to actually be that Pedo guy?🤔 anyone care to explain?🤔🤔🤔

Pauly_Walnutz,And the rest of the GOP will support him because laws don’t apply to them.
mnorri,“One charge and three investigations?!  Those are rookie numbers.  Pfft.  Give him a chance to prove himself.  Give him a couple years and he’ll reply run up the numbers. This guy could set records!!!”
thenextamerican,"In other words, McCarthy doesn’t care about the deception, like not at all."
HereForTwinkies,Well House is going to flip in 2024.
fluffybottom,"Shit, trump was under federal investigation for his fake university and was ordered to pay out rather than go to prison. Santos will probably be protected, since he’s up mccarthy’s ass."
IcyOrganization5235,Note to McCarthy: fraud is a crime.
rounder55,Wonder what Kevin McCarthy would think if I paid someone to pretend to be his chief of staff to raise money.
AtalanAdalynn,"In more than one country, McCarthy."
WaitingForNormal,"The charge is fraud. They voted for one thing and got something completely different. Not just a shift in ideals, but lying about his own credentials. The man is an actual criminal."
hubaloza,"Well, we keep expecting the U.S. government to hold the U.S. government accountable and acting shocked as if that's how accountability worked in this context, the police don't do a very good job of policing themselves either. It is the responsibility of the citizens of the republic to hold their elected officials accountable."
RabidBeaverLake,Al Franken should have never resigned.
hamsterfolly,“We won’t do shit until he’s taken away in cuffs” -McCarthy
4711Shimano,"Leave it Craven McCarthy to run a tight moral and ethical ship.

Yes, Qevin, drain the swamp, and start with yourself.

As was the case with Trump, we are lucky these morons are so lazy and stupid. They will do a lot of damage, but there is a limit."
grigsbie,McCarthy is going to lose majority in the House and it’s going to be so fucking hilarious to watch.
thistimelineisweird,"Let's be honest, what Santos has done is child's play compared to most GOP members. Until he reveals information about orgies, coke parties, and sex trafficking no one in the party will care.

He is, quite literally, the embodiment of the GOP in 2022. They'll probably run him for President in 2024 or 2028 once Trump's influence is gone."
2cool_4school,"But when it comes to Hunter Biden, something must be done!"
shadow1515,"""Haha just kidding; we can't charge him with an ethics violation because we decided not to have that committee anymore."""
Dgodfrey78,I find it hard to believe Republicans would just believe a con man who lies about his schooling and background to get elected. That’s absurd!
The_Pandalorian,Santos is the best Republicans can do.
Wild_Guess_7402,He’s the prefect Republican…what’s the problem?
Tiduszk,Revolutionary war hero George Santos? The very same George Santos who invented penicillin and founded Apple? That George Santos? I heard he even witnessed Jesus’s birth.
whitstableboy,George Santos looks like someone who whose search history includes phrases I'd have to Google and then I'd end up in court.
acelaya35,"Here's what I don't get, how in the hell did no one do their research on this guy BEFORE THE ELECTION.

I would think, should I ever run for office, that every moment of my life would be picked over with a fine tooth comb.

How in the hell did his opponent's campaign not catch him in his lies?"
Revolutionary-Ad4588,Damn.  Homie couldn’t even get sworn in before the crimes were well-known.  Republicans aren’t even trying anymore
takatori,"Multiple charges, internationally, and this guy cares more about votes than ethics. Typical."
NerdyNThick,"> Is there a charge against him?

Are we even sure his name is really ""George"" ""Santos""?  When you're not sure if someone has provided their real name, any other question should be secondary.  Still important, but secondary."
Mtbruning,"McCarthy: “yes, but is he under indictment?
Yes
McCarthy: “but is he under arrest?”
Yes
McCarthy: “but has he been convicted...?”"
SpecterOfGuillotines,"If we ran every lying asshole out of Congress, there’d be no Republicans left in Congress.

But you can hardly expect the leader of the lying asshole party to admit that."
RDO_Desmond,Makes no difference to McCarthy. Their only purpose is to pass outrageously stupid laws that will not pass in the Senate. Their voters are so dumped down by years of grooming that they will never know the difference.
happyColoradoDave,He did give McCarthy the “ok” sign when he voted for him.  Maybe that means something to him.
I_am_darkness,"Unfortunately, criminal investigations are credentials for GOP politicians."
Amoney711,My government makes me wanna bash my head through a wall on the daily
AdApprehensive5069,Translation? He's not going to do anything about him.
baryoniclord,Republicans are pure evil.
Jv_waterboy,Proud to say I voted for his opponent. This guy has always been a fucking asshole. He was a fucking asshole before this shit hit the fan and he'll be a fucking asshole after he gets voted out in a few years.
Tattooedyeti,Conservative values.
Throwaway0242000,"Al Franken resigned over a hand touching a flack jacket decades in the past. 

Republicans have zero moral compass."
whatsgoodforme,Remember when Al Franken resigned for taking a picture?
jtscira,"GOP be like ""Santos 2024"""
iskyoork,Why would criminals care if other criminals are criminals?
phutch54,"Shameless.If he was a Democrat,they'd be on him like rabid dogs."
TracyJ48,"Gaslight, sow seeds of doubt. The GOP agenda for the next two years. Oh, and lie."
Dr_Retch,"I typed extradition into Google and this came up immediately, US Congress source:

""Extradition. An extradition treaty between the United States and Brazil was signed on January 13, 1961 and implemented on February 11, 1965. The treaty allows both countries to request the return of individuals if the offense(s) committed are considered crimes by both countries.""

Could he serve in the House from a jail in Brazil? Inquiring minds want to know!"
swennergren11,"Kevin McCarthy, master of ignoring real crimes while investigating bullshit conspiracy theories.

Here comes two years of investigating nothing-burger accusations against Biden - or Benghazi Act 2- while real criminals sit in the House getting away with shit.

Fucking ‘Murica.  Republicans have ruined my country."
FloridianRobot,"Yeah my guy, lot of your buddies there have criminal charges against them. Shocking."
Shop-Impressive,Spineless sycophant makes misguided comments about a lying fraudster. Sounds like a typical Thursday for the GOP.
dabbean,..like mccarthy gives a fuck if he has a criminal charge pending..
xr_21,Lol if only Republicans had the balls to pull an Al Franken on Santos.... yeesh
porkbellies37,Was there a charge against Al Franken?
MickeyMalph,Why did Al Franken resign again?
youcancallmeBilly,"If George Santos was a democrat, we would be having an entirely different conversation."
Hoobs88,I stand corrected MTG is not the biggest defender of Liars.
kdonirb,they've both signed a pact with the devil; each other
preciousillusion,Don’t worry - McCarthy doesn’t fear goal posts. He will move them.
multisubcultural1,This is why his nickname is Kevin McLousy.
99999999999999999901,There is no charge precedent.
Jimbo415650,So why doesn’t Kevin know that?
CreepyWhistle,"Setting the bar low to keep a seat in Congress. Undoubtedly, he'd cry on about resigning if it were a Democrat.

Walking a fine line, though. If Santos gets removed by force or sent to Brazil, it'll make the GOP looks worse than they already do by just defending him."
walkerb79,Honestly keeping him hurts the GOP more in the long run so let them lay in their shit...
spookycasas4,Follow the money…
ioncloud9,"So thats where the goalposts are now. A charge. And next week it will be a conviction. There is no such thing as ethics or morals to these people, only power."
It_is_I_Satan,I mean Santos is the absolute perfect embodiment of the Republican platform.
,Party before constituents and country always
CarlBrault,He will next ask if he has been convicted.
Fearless-Memory7819,Why ? He's just like most other politicians. EDIT- Know why politicians wear their ties so tight ? Keeps their foreskin from covering up their whole head .
MindSteve,"If being lying criminal scum disqualified you from office, we'd be living in a very different country right now."
Jimbo_1252,"McCarthy, the liar, will twist himself into a pretzel defending.....another Liar."
nenulenu,Power at any cost. They think they are shrewd. But they are just immoral.
livelaughcum666,I hate to say this but technically McCarthy is not wrong. Investigations do not equal charges. It’s like Trump getting a bagillion criminal investigations. Until anyone is willing to proceed with formally filing charges that leads to an arrest or indictment and actually vigorously pursue it they can argue political persecution all they want.
1zzie,"Don't underestimate their cowardice, and above all, opportunism. Congressmen have been known to resign only after a conviction, so you know, when they have to go to jail. They'll try to wait for the news cycle to move on, especially if Santos is taking dirty money, he will be seen as a useful launderer as long as he shares with the RNC."
Ass_feldspar,At this rate Santos is going to be a republican superstar.
gogojack,"Kevin McCarthy on Charles Manson:

""I mean, he didn't actually murder anyone himself, right?  Maybe he's just misunderstood?  I mean...Hollywood.  Anyone else not seeing this?  Actresses, hippies, all living in a house together.  Can you really pin the murders on him?"""
sentientshadeofgreen,And the chucklefucks of the north shore of Long Island elected him and unleashed their boy on the rest of the country. Do better next time dumbasses.
say592,"If you haven't already, go read his Wikipedia. It's absolutely wild."
rbaldwin99,"“I too, don’t know what I am talking about”"
Necessary_Row_4889,"He’s got a charge on him that gives him some house cred, McCarthy will probably make him submit some vile legislation to prove he’s cool then they will jump him in. House GOP man, blood in, blood out."
u2nh3,As McCarthy is the leader and is the moral compass of the GOP. -fitting.
smokedspirit,"Santos is exactly their kinda candidate.

Deflect is a great ability to have for them"
rahzarrakyavija,"Remember the times when Representatives used to resign just because they lost face for lying, or even if there was a scandal?

Nowadays they have absolutely no Remorse or Moral conscience."
PrinceAdamsPinkVest,McCarthy is corrupt *and* stupid.
BeddingtonBlvd,What a low bar
,Kevin will feel differently when George single-handedly calls for a vote to oust Kevin as speaker.
DiploJ,Santos is a saint in Republican circles.
Mel_Melu,Where is his district? Are they collecting signatures or something for a recall? I need to see this blow up harder for the GOP.
StealyEyedSecMan,A criminal investigation?! I thought that was the price of entry.
MisterPiggins,"""But he voted for me, so how can he be bad?  Also, he sold me a very important bridge at a deep deep discount."""
carlboykin,Funny how it’s so different to them when a democrat gets accused of anything. Amazing how people can’t see the hypocrisy. What’s good for the goose is never good for the gander.
Business_Network_703,I guess that lying and being deceitful is OK. Nothing to see here!
lifeat24fps,God both of them are such little weanies. It’s incredible how members of this party see themselves as some kind of amazing specimens of American masculinity.
Samurai_gaijin,"Jealous that there is actual criminal shit that can be found about people on your side, asshole?"
fountain19,I'm just the speaker of the house. Stop telling me facts I don't want to hear. Im too busy effing shit up for America. Fake news.
TheseLipsSinkShips,"Beyond looking the other way… now the republicans make excuses for undeniable criminal behavior.  Ken Paxton, Trump… all further down the indictment line than Santos.  We’ll be lucky to be rid of him after 2024."
Killco_Joe,"GOP: ok, he says he has broken the law, but where is the evidence?"
TheMightyPrince,"I wonder if gutting the ethics committee was the deal McCarthy had to agree to get the votes he needed for speaker?

The thing is, Santos lied but the Trump lied all the time and no one from the Republican party seemed to care."
flyingtiger188,Republican politicians and potentially Republicans in general have no concept of differentiating between morally wrong and legally wrong. Perhaps that is part of the basis for trying to make Christian law US law.
Main-Muscle-2114,Is that conservative ethics?
BacktoTralfamadore,Al Franken PRETENDED to grope boobs.
BrianMcMor1,"Actually, there are no criminal indictments filed against George Santos that I can find.  And what are these investigations, for what laws broken?  If you have them, please share them.  Otherwise, this is just more disinformation.  It is easy to see that Santos is a liar, but then so are 90% of politicians.  Nothing new here"
Ok-Faithlessness1679,Republicans are such great role models.
orundi,my biggest concern with all this horseshit isn't that he's a liar or a fraud. it is the fact that the FBI vetted this bozo for a top secret clearance. everyone seems to be forgetting this point. fed. sens and reps need to be vetted for eligibility and national security.
Feisty_Factor_2694,"Fraud, waste, abuse AND incompetence? Those are some resume points, right there."
VergerCT,I think both men are scum but something we all should remember If you’re running or are in political office it’s okay to lie.
Consistent_Sport_296,Kevin is a dirtbag. He needs Santos vote so he does not care about his character or if he is a criminal as long as he votes with McCarthy. Pathetic republicans. Win at any cost if he is a liar and a criminal that fits just fine with the Republicians.
sonofabutch,"Kevin McCarthy today: ""Well, is there a charge against him?""

Kevin McCarthy tomorrow: ""OK, there's a charge against him, but has he been convicted?""

Kevin McCarthy in six months: ""OK, he was convicted, but has his appeal been heard?""

Kevin McCarthy in two years: ""George who?"""
765123boy,What a fknPOS thing to ask.
Jtskiwtr,George Santos is exactly what the GOP embodies now.  Lies upon lies...and none of them care because they keep getting away with it.
Espritsoul,"Some people ignore the elephant in the room, this guy rides it and gaslights that there isn’t one"
Broadpath1081,Kevin McCarthy will certainly go down in history… like waaay down…. into the anal of history.
mythofinadequecy,"How about the charges against your turd emperor, kev?"
valuedminority,Ethics don’t matter to them. Only what they can be held responsible for.
wooferberg,It’s also hilarious about he went on about respecting the VOTERS decision after happily participating in Trump’s attempt to void the voters’ decision.
SockFullOfNickles,"What’s even more hilarious is that McConnell and McCarthy are both part of the same GOP sub sect. So much of the arguing that’s seen is just pure political theater. When the time comes to slash taxes for their donors and shit on the average American, they will come together like butt cheeks. They all have the same donors, after all."
Dgodfrey78,This is the end of MCCarthys political career and he knows it. He’ll make any deal to try and not go down as one of the worst house speakers in US history. I mean just imagine knowing you’ll be mocked throughout history.
Equivalent-Excuse-80,McCarthy has no political choice but to keep him until they have a GOP candidate that is guaranteed to win that district in a special election. And the voters of that swing district are probably a little upset with the GOP.
Knighth77,Criminality is subjective to Republicans.
PlusResponsibility89,This is exactly the problem with the GOP!
Nords1981,Are there any GOP members that aren't criminals right now? What do they care as long as the morons keep voting for them.
quesadilla79,"Ken Paxton of Texas has been under criminal indictment for over 6 years,  I'm shure santos will be held to some sort of standard."
Pazluz,Of course he would say that. He's peer lied all over his resume. Not surprised coming from someone who passed a bill so quickly to help his other peers to escape tax accountability.
NeadNathair,It's great having a Speaker of the House that's so stupid that he has no idea what's going on concerning criminal investigations of his own party House members.
Virtual-Mirror-5262,IDIOTS! God help us all!
Budmanes,Under three other investigations?  He’ll fit right in
MongooseOne,"Our government is a joke. 

We need a purge and just get rid of everyone over 60 and start fresh."
EaglesPDX,"McCarthy meant a criminal charge and no there is not a charge in the US.

But there is a charge of fraud, which Santos admits, and it is raised by the GOP itself.  While the local NY GOP sees Santos as damaging to the GOP in winning elections, McCarthy does not.  Considering it was NY GOP the delivered the House to the GOP in 2022 due to Democrats political corruption issues, you would think McCarthy would help them and himself out for 2024 by showing that the GOP might be white supremacist, Christian anti-democratic party but that ""deceit, lies and fabrication"" were beyond even the GOP.

[""George Santos' campaign last year was a campaign of deceit, lies and fabrication,"" said Nassau Republican chairman Joseph Cairo. ""His lies were not mere fibs. He disgraced the House of Representatives.""](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nassau-county-gop-set-to-speak-out-against-congressman-george-santos/)

[Cairo and dozens of top party leaders are hoping to thwart potential damage on Long Island to the Republican brand.](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nassau-county-gop-set-to-speak-out-against-congressman-george-santos/)

trixtah,These reporters need to start asking hardball follow up questions.
MisterBackShots69,"We have been doing this for, what six years, will he be convicted? And will it be a lengthy sentence (I mean look at Trump’s CFO, five months?)? Otherwise, who gives a shit? We can keep get riled up but nobody is actually being held accountable, it’s fucked!"
Alternative-Flan2869,"Doesn’t matter - santos is a kevin vote and clearly is unafraid of lying about anything, anytime, anywhere, to anyone for any reason - or no reason. So gqp."
c_girl_108,“Innocent until proven guilty” lol does that count if you flee a country to prevent the criminal proceedings from commencing
xproofx,"Yeah, but he meant other than that charge."
,"The GOP has goalposts on wheels for criminality in their party. First it's ""well have any charges been brought""? Then ""Well has there been a prosecution?"" Then ""Well was he found guilty?"" then ""well he served his time"" or ""we're not electing a pope!"""
trombone646,Those concessions tho…
StandupJetskier,"Interesting to see that tonights' news showed his local Nassau republicans unified in wanting him out.  He must have burned some huge bridges there.....of course, he has escaped local Nassau Repubs, who are somewhat reality based, into cloud-coo-koo criminal fantasy land...."
