KhaosElement,"What's this?! An indie game advertisement on reddit that just talks about the game and NOT how you spent your life savings in a shitty pity ploy? 

I'll buy it just for that alone."
liqfan,First self promo I actually like. Looks awesome!
raven726,looks very Ori-esque.  Definitely looks cool with the swap mechanic.
subtleeffect,I normally wouldn't play this type of game but this actually looks really fun
ziyadah042,"It looks great, but you're going to want to do something to make the character more visible when it crosses dark background areas.  Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't in the video, and you're going to get endless complaints about losing track of the character's exact position in the places where you don't.  That's fine with a lot of games, but with a precision platformer it doesn't work well."
generally_amazing,Looks great! Which Engine was used to make this?
antunezn0n0,i know it's just a promo but maybe change some of the playable characters model to be more visible. the game seems to be fast paced and it's kinda  hard to follow through on some of the instance. look how limbo inside and meatboy have the playable character be quite distinct from the backgrounds so it's easy to track because it took me to the second viewing to notice there was a person and not a speck of light
Jury_Of_Your_Fears,"I hate that people use this sub to advertise...

_usually._"
dropkickninja,This looks awesome
PhoneAcc2,Backgrounds look really nice. Different art style and faster gameplay but still reminds me a bit of 'The Swapper' from 2013.
SKPrime6,Wow. Those visuals are insane
ToastedHunter,Not my style of game but looks very neat and interesting. Wishing you success
MR_DERP_YT,"The design reminds me of Badlands (the game with those black flying bird thing) ngl... where to play this game

Edit: just checked their twitter page, and then their website... it seems the company/person for the graphics design of this is the one who designed Badlands 1 and 2. Pretty cool!"
ThighBiter1993,"As others have said, the one critique I have is the visibility of the character. Make em just a biiiiit more visible. Other than that, looks awesome"
Scorpion0606,I'm a little bit into the demo and this game is BEAUTIFUL!! The movement feels really good and the environments are soo cool keep up the amazing work. I would seriously pay good money for this game! Also will probably tell some friends about it!
Xzaar,I’ve strong Ori vibes here. And that’s a good thing.
ThunderSnowDuck,"If this feels as good to play as it looks like it does, count me in"
Evilmaze,Will it be a continuous game like Limbo or is it just challenging levels like Super Meat Boy?
KnifeFightAcademy,Dude this looks like the little guy I imagine running along side my car when I'm a passenger on road trips.
bobotheboinger,Game looks really cool! Are you considering releasing on GoG? I normally try to buy there to support DRM free games.

nerv200015,Where I can whishlist the game?
Harizzium,I’m very interested in the how mechanics are gonna play out

weristjonsnow,Heavy ori vibes.. Very cool
Austins_positivism,Ha! That’s cool!
kittenzombiecake,Played the demo and gave some feedback. Very fun so far
punto2019, Seems very good! Name and release date?
Plusran,"Hey dude, just finished playing through your demo. there was a TONNN of stuff in there! I hope I haven't just played through most of the game. You left a lot for me and my kid to play when the game releases, right?

Anyway, It's good, and I've wishlisted it.

I'll put this feedback behind a spoiler, because spoilers

>!Personally, I had a hard time with the microgravity sun. It was fun when I just ran and jumped and flew around the thing. That was cool, but the controls felt .... wrong. and it's just not fun to struggle with a puzzle in game simply because the controls don't let you move the way you expect to. In the rest of the game, the controls are absolute. up always means up. But here, the controls switch to relative. Now 'up' suddenly means something else. Cognitively, this is confusing, but not in a fun way.!< 

>!i LOVED falling down the bounce room. That was silly fun. I hope you put a couple more of those in the game, and maybe just randomly in places, chucking the character up into the air, ragdoll pinwheeling through the sky. surprise! !< 

so anyway, thanks for the fun, and good luck."
eddio69,It seems like a bit to much
fenikz13,"downloading the demo, looks good!"
DinckelMan,"Shoot us a Steam link when it is available to wishlist. I'd buy this in a heartbeat, for a reasonable price"
DrBrainzz9,I actually legitimately can't tell where the PC is for most of these shots.

lucidportia,"A game where you can use Sasukes rinnegan swap, looks fun!"
SpasticGoldenToys,Were you inspired by the old browser based game called Fault Line by any chance?
epicboogster2988,Does it happen to be an allegory for depression? If so count me in!
FauxGw2,Dude amazing! Keep us updated please.
Live_Builder_4076,"I’ve played the demo, CANT WAIT! Omfg this game plays well, the environments are well designed and MENACING! Nothing to put you in your place like a pipe the size of a house. Look forward to it <3"
Magnetheadx,"Looks pretty cool

I wish the character wasn't 16 pixels high"
gnipz,The style looks great!
ArchDucky,This looks really great.  Congrats.  Will say I super don't like platformers that change the size of the main character.  I know it looks really cool but it makes playing the game harder.
VolkspanzerIsME,That looks beautiful. Good job.
have_some_apricot,Kinda reminds me of badlands a bit. A plus for me ngl
amd_c0mplex,"that game is a huge W, would buy it instantly fr"

SuperLemonHaze_,Looks pretty good. I played Ori and it was pretty good.
zulan,5e 2ahUKEwi51_vm8_r1AhUQHTQIHaYSBu0QFnoECBAQAQ&usg p
I_Go_By_Q,"Really cool! I feel like it may be hard to play, with how small the player-character is, but wow that leads to some breathtaking visuals (my favorite is the one with the giant hand)

The swap mechanic is really cool too!"

ERREIP96,When and where can buy this ?
taintedchops,"Out of all the posts about indie games and the devs groveling for people here to buy it with some sob story, this is the first one that actually made me say “I’d buy that”. This game looks great, and bonus points for not attaching a self deprecating story to get pity sales. This game seems awesome"
Gundares,Looks awesome. If well priced and it works well on the steam deck you've convinced me!
Revn_vox,"Normally i'm not into platform games but this looks awesome.

I'll deftly put on my list to try it out."
TactlessTortoise,"Yoooo, I can recognize Noita's game engine anywhere. Wishlisted."

MarkSundgot,"just got a paycheck, where can I buy it? like NOW

TheRandom6000,"I need glasses, or it's all really tiny."
systemfrown,"Definite ""***Lode Runner***"" vibes...

Please tell me I'm not the only one who remembers Lode Runner, or I'm just going to go out and buy a walker and hearing aid right now."
Cornflake0305,Kinda reminds me of gunpoint
noobi-wan-kenobi2069,"I'd play it, if the character was just a tiny dot on the screen. With so much effort put into the background and other graphics, it would have been nice to actually be able to see that playing character."
muzitron69,"Reminds me of that of monsters and mens music video for ""little talks"".  Art style is amazing."
Newestfield,Space ori!
Verciau,GIME IT
Shavethatmonkey,"WOW.  I'm impressed, that looks pretty cool.  Not even a genre I'm into but I'd get it."
Acoustic420,"I remember seeing the first vid, looks really cool man"
The-Coolest-Of-Cats,"Am I crazy, or did you post like a year or so ago about the game too? Surprised I haven't seen any comments mentioning that. Looks to be shaping up nicely, not really my kind of game personally, but I'd image for the people that it is they will have a blast!"
Warlornn,Wow. That looks really good. I'm genuinely impressed and interested.
Bear_Lonely,I can barely see the character. I wonder if that's going to translate into more difficult and frustrating gameplay.
Idealistic_Crusader,"Wow,  now that is something.

Caught my attention and held it.

I'll be looking forward to this."
Littlebigman2292,This artstyle reminds me alot of BADLAND that old app game with the little flying circle dudes.
xXD3F4LTX,Well you've done good job you make me want to build my ideas even more
camsiff,Where I do I send all of my money ?
Elegant_Spot_3486,Looks cool. Just wishlisted it to keep a watch on.
RedCaravanSwan,"How long did this take to make, and how much money are you expecting to gain? I'm thinking of making a game as a side hustle, but there are mixed opinions (mostly negative) if it is worth it.

I think I have the skills. I've been a professional software dev for over 10 years, and I'm good at writing quality code that allows me to finish a project."
alisaraven,That looks really amazing
tjlightbulb,This looks GREAT.
s4t0sh1n4k4m0t0,"**Wishlisted**, man can't wait to stream this"

silvalen,"OP, really nice game! I downloaded the demo and played thorough the first level on my Steam Deck. Plays perfectly on it! Really looking forward to the release of the completed game."
Lambskin1,This looks really cool. Make sure it works well on Steam deck and in all over it.
DruciferRedBeard,Saw this yesterday as promoted by the Steam Store and wishlisted it. It reminds me of The Swapper but with the interesting object swap puzzle mechanic. Looking forward to playing this.
SleeplessGrimm,Honestly looks like a very cool platformer
sometimes-i-say-stuf,Wow a genuinely new game mechanic
Ok-Nature-3991,Looks good man!

StarChaser_Tyger,Looks nifty. Will download the demo when I get home.
ZoeyKaisar,"That swap mechanic- Trickster, is that you?"
williwaggs,This looks great
KittenLina,"I literally go out of my way to not buy these “I’ve been wanting to do this my whole life” or “I quit my job to work on this the last x years” bullshit games.

I don’t go on r/gaming for advertising from bots, this is ridiculous."
ball_fondlers,"Played the demo - it’s pretty solid! Definitely would like to echo what others have said in this thread, though - more contrast between the PC and the background would be good. Also, your checkpoint distribution is generally pretty solid, but it got a bit annoying towards the end of the demo - that downward slide+jump into missiles killed me more times than the rest of the demo. Still, it’s worth a wishlist - looking forward to the full release!"
tobito604,It looks cool to be honest
YoMoejoe,"Please make a Youtube Playlist for the soundtrack, so that all can enjoy it."
OmegaStageThr33,This looks amazing. Any plans to bring it to console?

GGingerbeardman,Ori and the Noita Limbo
Ianilla1,This looks challenging and fucking awesome. Excellent!
Jaszuni,Great art direction
goldrat1,"Out of interest, was the swap mechanic at all inspired by the similar mechanic in *Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective*?"
Coitsu,Already on my Steam wishlist
x4it3n,Looks really fun and cool! Congratulations 👏🎉 I might buy it on Steam to support you 😁
SaltSomewhere2662,Dude it’s literally masterpiece I definitely play this game but please make this on apple or ps5
DerpySlerper,Jack septiceye would love this

Cleverkid62,"Ori with less feeling? I'm into it, honestly. Take my money."
DayVCrockett,Looks like an improved spin on Limbo.
DogBerry99,This looks fucking amazing it kinda reminds me of unraveled but it looks WAAAY more advanced than that I would buy this game for sure
Late-Wedding6277,Is that Tinker Bell jumping around?
Ok_Anteater_1865,looks awsome
RadioactiveSalt,The visual style reminds me of Badland. Cool game.
SagittarWolf,Has OP played GRIS perhaps…?
MyPasswordStartsWith,I love the art style and the gameplay looks fun
stayh1gh361,Sick Vision. Thank you for pushin it in the gaming section.
TunaPablito,"There already is a game called The Swapper with ""unique"" swap mechanic. Besides that this game looks much different."
shootbob79,I downloaded the demo and it's really an excellent experience. Both my son and I have had a lot of laughs trial and erroring bounce lasers and explosives! A definite buy from me. Thanks.
Fedor1,"Just finished the demo and really enjoyed it. One small request would be to change the color of the lasers, or add a color blind mode. I couldn’t tell the difference between the bouncy lasers and the burny lasers without trial and error lol."
LeoLeomxs,"I like these kind of environment

But not the gameplay with all calculations and jumps."
BoorishCampaign293,Looks really good! Date of release and name?
Particular_Let9429,i've allways wanted to make a game like assassins creed mixed with  the arkhem games but you play as different symbiote with clayface being a collab

I'm not much into puzzles but definitely gonna be buying this out when it comes out."

Even-End-3065,!remind me 2 hours
Supdalat,You already have my wishlist... ill try the demo after work
Bearfase,Incredible work!!!!
YaxYaxx,"While this FREE ADVERTISEMENT for this game is not nearly as bad as some I've seen, I fucking hate these posts on regular subreddits, and whenever I see these it pretty well ensures I will never pay money for that game, but I realize that's probably a minority opinion. There's already a way to advertise on Reddit and I hate when advertisers try to invade spaces not meant for that, such as ordinary subreddits."
jeusee,This will be doodle jump in 2013
Filandalt,Night elf paladin since one already exists in the lore
captain-capwn,Sci-fi Noita
Grogosh,Amazing look to it
Lexisseuh,"Is it on ps4? I wanna play it because it looks cool, but my pc sucks."

EstupidoPololo,Right to the whislist!
Cheebzsta,"This looks like a Super Mario Bros sequel where Tinkerbell gets a malfunctioning portal gun...

... while on acid.

I dig it!"
