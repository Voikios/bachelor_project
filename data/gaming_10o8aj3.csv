shush03,Man: Game of the Year Edition was truly an inspiring game.
TheButteredBiscuit,"Hey you. Look behind you.

I said, **look behind you**."
Psychological-Run-40,shame you can‚Äôt download it anymore
precursorlegacy,"P.T. Is rare I guess.

Released for the PlayStation 4 on August 12, 2014 as a free download on the PlayStation Network, P.T. served as an interactive teaser for the game Silent Hills, an installment in the Silent Hill series. After the cancellation of Silent Hills, Konami removed P.T. from the PlayStation Store and made it impossible to reinstall. The decision prompted criticism, fan efforts to allow P.T. to be re-downloaded,and fan remakes."
ecosystems,‚ÄúOh look a nice game about a Forest‚Äù
SirTheadore,Yeah it‚Äôs in my account too but you can‚Äôt download it. You can only play it if it‚Äôs already installed.
Goofym0f0420,Did you find the fetus in the sink? Lol that game was weird
Mikimao,"Honestly, one of the creepiest experiences I ever played, and it's only a demo, lol."
MichaelFuery,Now you do realise how much that PS4 is worth now that you have evidence as proof cha-ching
JBCronic,The one that got away. P.T. had so much potential.

budyll66,"You can't download it anymore anyway. I have it in my library like that as well. When you try to download it, it gives you some kind of an error."
superbear19,One of the only games I have left still on my ps4 I never deleted it and never uninstaled it
rightphoenix,Actual treasure
zombax,That PlayStation just became worth $200 more
Artistic-Community92,"As the Congressional Debate over gun control flares up yet again, we regret to report the murder of the wife and her two children by their husband and father. The father purchased the rifle used in the crime at his local gunstore two days earlier. This brutal killing took place while the family was gathered at home on a Sunday afternoon. The day of the crime, the father went to the trunk of his car, retrieved the rifle, and shot his wife as she was cleaning up the kitchen after lunch. When his ten-year-old son came to investigate the commotion, the father shot him, too. His six-year-old daughter had the good sense to hide in the bathroom, but reports suggest he lured her out by telling her it was just a game. The girl was found shot once in the chest from point-blank range. The mother, who he shot in the stomach, was pregnant at the time. Police arriving on-scene after neighbors called 911 found the father in his car, listening to the radio. Several days before the murders, neighbors say they heard the father repeating a sequence of numbers in a loud voice. They said it was like he was chanting some strange spell. There was another family shot to death in the same state last month, and in December last year, a man used a rifle and meat cleaver to murder his entire family. In each case, the perpretrators were fathers. State police say the string of domestic homicides appears unrelated, though it could be part of a larger trend, such as employment, childcare, and other social issues facing the average family."
Independent_Plum2166,"‚ÄúWait you do know what this is‚Ä¶right?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yes, Kojima‚Äôs masterpiece that will never be, damn Konami, they‚Äôll only take this off the PS4 if they pry it from my cold dead hands!!!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I meant Mass Effect: Andromeda, but you do you auntie.‚Äù"
Dragonwarden30,I see  she likes my favorite superhero MAN.
LordYoshi,PT has been dumped online. It's readily available. I don't understand why anyone would pay for it.
hatypotamous,PENIS TOUCHER
XxMr_Pink_PupxX,"Shame it‚Äôs not downloaded, a ps4 with pt still installed on it can sell for a lot of money"
Ardibanan,How is Sims on controller.

Im_high_toto,"Omg i hella forgot about PT, I remember consoles were being sold for an insane amount if they had that demo still on it‚Ä¶."

ComfortableAmount993,It's not installed though and it never will be.
KittenLina,"Unless it's already installed, you can't just reinstall it."
Kindred_03,"Hey your aunt is preserving gaming history, she is doing gods work honestly."

Ender__dominus,someone explain pls
RoyalGarbage,"Wait, you guys were talking about PT? I thought this was about The Order 1886."
Gl1tchyVirus,Did she have it installed on the other ps4 or is it just deleted because im pretty sure that once you deleted it it was gone
Ray_Mang,My PS4 still has PT downloaded. Is it actually rare and/or worth anything?
420StarWars,That ps4 is worth a lot now
SirGallyo,Pretty sure there is some remake by a YouTuber with 30k subs. It‚Äôs on IOS and Android aswell
CDL_Main,Has to be already downloaded on the system or it isn't usable. Was completely delisted and Konami has prevented any further downloads of the Playable Trailer because they're twats.
DarkSoldier856,"I‚Äôm assuming this is silent hill pt? 

Never played any of the silent hill games, but seen gameplay of pt in vr‚Ä¶. Prolly some of the most creepiest üí© I‚Äôve seen."
MobOnAHighHorse,Arent people paying a lot for console with it in it?

HBizzle24,_Don‚Äôt trust that dial now we‚Äôre just getting started_
Your_Average-Ginger,Gotta love Physical Therapy: the Game
ibreakforturtlez,"My friend group would go to a family farm out in Quebec for a new years bender while we were in high school & after (4 years in a row).

We'd bring all sort of things to keep us occupied over the three days, one being single player or split screen games. PT was played every year, usually by someone who had never done it (core friends could invite a plus 1) while everyone else watched.

Booze + people who don't usually game + lights out = an unforgettable time, every time.

This game holds a lot of good memories!!"
ProbablyBen12,NEVER SELL THAT PS4 ITS WORTH THOUSANDS
Professional-Paper75,And? I have it as well?

koalaroo_,I have it in my library too but it doesn't let me download it
minari99,Apparently PS4's that have P.T. installed are wanted by gamers because you can't get it anymore from Playstasion Network. So you're basically sitting on gold here.
