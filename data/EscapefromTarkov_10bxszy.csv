hrax13,"Don't forget sherpa status comes with free ~~weekly~~ gear delivery every 2-3 months, because they assume you gonna loose some while sherpaing others.

EDIT: I was made aware that my weekly estimate is not correct."
Mightypeon-1Tapss,we had Gear Fear now we have Account Fear lmao
schnaps991,"I remember killing him onstream in labs couple of wipes ago, then tune into his stream to say gg only to have him shittalk me for ferrari peeking him and calling me a peekers advantage abuser. I mean it's funny how fragile his ego is, i don't know how someone could even consider him being a sherpa lol"
Hildedank,Does he even help new people out? Why is he even a sherpa to begin with...?
Barcode_88,"Reng should definitely lose Sherpa and BSG should apologize.

u/william21south did you get your account back?"
ilmacribile,"he doesn't need to get his sherpa removed because he got the guy banned. He needs to get it removed because he doesn't deserve it and bsg can't let someone like him represent the EFT community. 

This guy is a shame."
Iron_Snow0,Best Sherpa is glorious E him and d0rse are the most positive EFT streamers
mrfudface,"Rengawr that type of guy that says that ""if you go in Labs with a Kedr-B you literally have gear fear"" [Here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eDpOvYvgNs)"
Lang9219,"I support this. IF not taking it away maybe BSG has a look on the case...

&#x200B;

but NOTHING will be a very wrong sign"
RC_0041,I was under the impression sherpas take new players into raid and help them learn the game. If Rengawr isn't doing this at least half the time he is live he should have lost it a long time ago. Sherpas are in high demand and if he isn't doing what he signed up to do he isn't a sherpa.
CyborgPangolin,Dude is a fuckin chud.
xLobotomizer,He should be banned. Abusing streamer status to put false bans on people just for kill him.
SeansBeard,"Its BSG's fault. They should never rely on player or streamers ""opinion"" when dealing bans. Any ban should be justified . If they hand out bans without justification, it shows how bad they are at managing... well anything."
Highmichaelphelp,He won’t lol
SlowLml,His whole attitude reminds of the kids show character Caillou.
devon223,This is just a great first hand example of these steamers having too much sway in game development. They are like the top 0.5% of players. This shit happens with a lot of games.
Forrell92,"+1 , what a fucking joke that this can be a thing."
TwoTuxedosFPS,He most certainly should. His in game name is literally “Cheetmegetban” . He is a egotistical small pp rat who lives at a computer & thinks he is gods gift to Tarkov. BSG needs to have a staff make over as well.
Dyils,"And this happened not too long after we heard about 2 blue named players (admins) banning the guy who killed them in dorms.

That wasn't even that long ago... you'd think BSG would learn something or change something after that incident, but no."
BeenDrowned,Getting to a point where we’re going to have to destroy the space on our drivers to record the entire raid for proof we aren’t cheating if this is how BSG and Sherpas react to getting dumped on. Tired of all these fragile egos of streamers thinking they just shouldn’t ever die unless it’s to another big name streamer.
misterchubz,"100% agree, the entitlement in his voice when he said he was going to get him banned is evidence enough"
,This post deserves a gold star for the title alone. Fuck Rengawr
BigManofWA,"Don't really care what happens to him; the fact that Streamers have priority on getting ACCUSED players banned is the real issue.  Everyone loves him, but for example Pestily having a direct line to not just the dev team but Nikita himself, sure it's nice when he can directly report to them about a bugged area on a new map or a bug with a new task or whatever, but when he can just hop on discord and report a hacker directly to them and the person likely gets banned nearly instantly just like this situation...  Does BSG do literally any sort of investigation or do they glance at the accused account, see it's 'only' a very low level compared to the streamer, and assume 'yeah probably a stream sniping hackerman, banned'?"
misterholmez,"We all agree, clear abuse"
NewbieInvestorCDN,"The guys is immature. Constantly talking about manual ""bans"". I'd like to see him lose his account for making innocent people lose their account because he thinks hes invincible. Everytime he dies it's due to a ""cheater"". Someone needs to deflate him. Typical League of Legends Player."
ThinkFastRunFast200,Rengar makes Tyler 1 look 6'5.
SnipinSnit,Isn't this the same guy who cried about not being first to kappa last wipe because someone got it while he was stuck on a task?
TheGoddess0fWar,And a formal public apology. What a shit head.
LiLGhettoSmurf,"Dude is a insufferable douche, even changed his twitch chat to sub only so he could bathe in his follower circle jerk rather than see some criticism."
UnrivaledSupaHottie,"people trying hard to shift all the blame to BSG, but everyone knows them especially streamer.

if i tell my violent and protective friend who i know likes to beat people up about this guy that i feel like he is mobbing me and i want him to receive a lesson i know for sure he will beat the person up at least. so me telling him about these things directly is just as much about me and abusing it...

is bsg shitty af especially in this context? yes totally!

does the guy abuse and use it to his advantage making him a shitty asshole too? yes it does.

while both should be punished we all know we cant do shit to bsg, but at least we could hope that his guy losing his privilege to abuse these things because of his own insecurities. thats still a win for the community overall"
Bob10576,I feel like a solid percentage of sherpas just do it for the green name and then AFK in customs lobby to attract people to their twitch channel.
BoogMan1980,Shiet all I’ve been hearing is that he’s a piece of work. I don’t think someone with that reputation alone should have the power to manual ban or be a sherpa
willy--wanka,"It's absolutely wild how he has sherpa status.  I mean I get it, he plays 24/7 and is a streamer so he helps in that way.  But man, imagine walking through a raid with that guy.  Or asking him several questions."
nighteeeeey,100% should lose sherpa. and get banned for 30 days for abuse of power. change my mind
Tentag10,"If you’re like me and can’t kill anyone there’s no risk of getting banned.  Problem solved.  Seriously though, this is messed up.  I used to hate falsely being accused of cheating in pubg and worry about false bans.  Several years of only pubg and I got halfway decent so there were people calling cheats.  I’ll never have to worry about that in Tarkov but good players or even lucky players shouldn’t have to worry about it either."
Dapper_Beginning3591,"I think he is a scam himself. Came across his stream the other day and he had 2,2K viewers. How?? That’s half of Pestily’s viewers on a normal day. Is he using a view bot?

This guy isn’t even interesting to watch because all he and his community does his bitch on players who might be cheating without any solid proof. He’s always bitching about cheaters when he dies. And his followers are all toxic and flaming on anybody who says something different.

I can name 5 streamers who are more interesting to watch and far more friendly and helpful then this try hard sweatlord."
Kblizzleizzle,Omg I love this. Rengawr succcccckkkkssss and is literally a child. His ego is as thin as his cock.
halo-st,Rengawr should lose his virginity LUL
Callen151,"I was watching JesseKazam when he killed him. They were on Customs, Jesse ran into him at the garages in front of RUAF and after a short play dropped him. Jesse immediately said that dysnc won that fight and when he went to Rengawr's stream he was shit-talking him and had called him a cheater before he saw it was Jesse and before he spoke up in his chat and posted a clip some had made from his perspective. Any respect I had for Rengawr went out the window at that point."
AlcoholicSkeleton,Has BSG even commented on this at all?
omgwtfsmhlol,You should need a certain number hours of sleep to be allowed to make a cheater report.
izack_is_here,Nah they need to rename the beta secure container to the rengawr container
StarBoi421,Tigz lost it for WAY less. He should have his stripped without question
akward_situation,Removing Sherpa status doesn't change a thing. Looks like BSG needs a manual review for manual bans. W key steamers getting tarkoved and instantly claiming cheating is the problem.
CarheartTheMan,I used to watch him noticed I killed him once.went to his chat to say gg got called a stream sniper then banned great times.
Lucien899,"I mean I watched his latest youtube apology video of him adressing this issue and honestly he ddin't even address what everyone is angry about .      


He goes on to say that everyone has the same ability to report a  suspected cheater via the launcher which you are allowed to do 1 report a day but he doesn't do that he says he ""Circumvents the system "" and sends a report to a dev directly .    This is why people are upset because he is not held to the same standard as everyone else and it shows that streamers have too much power and that is exactly what it is .    


Their is a lot go digest in his video and I feel he just doesn't get it and honestly he is trying to put out the fire he started and knows he di the "" I fked up "" so I need to save face and fix this ASAP .  


I don't care what happens to him I just him to be held to the same standard as everyone else and get no special treatment or special access that allows him to go directly over the system in place that everyone else has to do .  


The other issue that needs to be addressed by BSG is getting rid of Battle eye because of the simple fact once you are banned from Battle eye it is literally impossible to get unbanned unless you are  huge streamer with a following or have direct access to Nikita or a dev that can contact Battle eye . Even if you are able to get battle eye to un bann you its takes weeks or months for them to even reply to your ticket and if you are truly false banned to get unbanned and that is even if they even do it .  The experinced I have had with battle eye has always been horrible experince and 99% they will not unbann you even if you are innocent"
ogxmajik,"What a fragile little bitch. He should get a ""shitter"" tag"
prodigalbiker,Dude looks like his personality 100%
PM_ME_BUNZ,Shouldn't Rengawr just get banned? That would be much more hilarious.
Lethal_Alpaca_,Rengawr is a turd with an inflated ego. Almost every time he dies he claims a cheater killed him or something was wrong. His chat is even worse... I'd spit in his face if I met him.
_baundiesel_,"Obviously. Not sure why any ""big"" streamers are Sherpas anyways."
mmpa78,And his Twitcher partnership tbh. Fk that guy
dgibred,He and KLEAN are biggest tools in the community
Skoosti,"Onepeg got booted from the Sherpa program for some minor shit and he in my opinion, helps the community way more than Rengawr, so yes."
RandomedXY,This post will definitely not get deleted lol.
Khryn_Tzu-TTV,Hi DrLupo
HoneyFuk,Rengawr really needs to understand how much sway he actually has. Really horrible people who’ve paid money for the game have been banned because he said so.
Cat0nium,This streamer is just a weak boy.
aaronsisco,"I literally had someone wipe my group with a mosin, then he hopped into my stream and said he completed tarkov shooter 8 and we all celebrated with him. 

 The worst part of this game is the people who think they should never die, and when they do they throw a tantrum."
Separate-Advance-453,"If he is actually Sherpa teaching people then he should keep it, if not hand it back
I’ve seen around 3 streamers actually doing Sherpa teaching on stream and in the discord about 5 - it could be way more but it looks like the majority aren’t teaching anything at all but using it as a badge of honour. 

As for the emissary positions what are they actually doing? Two I’ve seen asking for data on bugs, issues etc  the rest seem to just flex that also for their twitch views 

As in life it’s not what you do it’s who you know"
Wyntier,None of these problems or drama exist if you don't visit this subreddit lol
ILikeToDisagreeDude,Dropped by his stream yesterday just to see who and what this dude was all about… he was talking about something not having to worry about being banned from YouTube or something because he knew a guy and could just unban himself? Something like that… sounded like a douche and ignored his channel…
admin123454321,rengawr has forever been the whiny bitch of tarkov. he just shouldn’t have viewers let alone anything else.
oejeh1,Don’t forgot to smash that dislike to his YouTube videos!
ttsbsglrsRDT,"BSG is literally the worst I've ever seen when it comes to managing a game and it's community. They do not give a single fuck. The only people who matter to them are streamers who advertise their game and give them money so that they can buy themselves some nice new cars. I enjoy the game for what it is, but I will never buy EOD. I'd feel like a complete sucker if I gave them another broken cent. I feel like if I had my gamertag under this post my account would also be gone within 10 minutes. Thank fuck my aim is shit otherwise I could have also accidentally killed a streamer that's full of himself who could have not been killed by anyone but a cheater thus I lose my account. And good luck trying to contact support. What a fucking joke."
Stolen_FBI_Van,"There isn't a reason he should be a Sherpa in the first place tbh. Sherpas ferry new players through quests, and he's just a streamer.

When it comes to content creators, it should probably be limited  to people like Pestily and people making actual guide content."
,[removed]
weaveryo,The fan boys are here defending him.
Event82Horizon,"You wanna watch an awesome and wholesome streamer plus he is a beast at the game. He's a sherpa and he fully deserves it. Go watch SheefGG and thank me later. 

I usually don't do that kinda stuff but he deserves it and when I think about this whole shitshow clown fiesta, SheefGG is literally the opposite of all this."
FatBoyFear,Also reported him to twitch this behavior should not be encouraged. What a fucking cunt.
loongod5,"He should 100% lose that title, he should be banned altogether on that account for some period of time if not permanently. This should be a lesson to all streamers, especially those with direct communication to developers, if you’re gonna pull shit like this you should be punished.

On that note Tarkov devs need to get their shit together and fix the audio, the desync, and the issue of cheaters/hackers.

What kind of game are you building, past wipes were never THIS bad."
bittytoy,Agreed 100%
Dayyyman,Agreed
Harley441,What is a Sherpa?
FishStoriesToldHere,http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1ss7mbq PepeLaugh
Apprehensive-Area814,They only give Sherpa to streamers in the hope that cheaters will target them less!
murrkpls,"Yeah that dude fucked up big and should definitely face some consequences. I get being salty with this game and people that killed you, that's something that the vast majority of the playerbase will be familiar with, but as a Sherpa you got to be smarter than this. If you're not 100% sure you should fuck off with your direct line and just use the regular report function.

If he's consistently this toxic he should be fucked off from Twitch altogether imo."
Mona_Impact,"Watching some VODs and he seems incredibly up his own ass, how could people actually enjoy watching him I'll never understand. He's not good and uses his equipment as a crutch."
Collguydev,ofc should lose it after banning innocent guy when its skill issue
Cheiff117,"Guy should defo be unbanned , b streamers need to not be able to do petty shit like this as it will ruin the game . BSG also need to get a grip imho"
KillerOfLight,"Tbh, its kinda wild to me that a gaming outlet hasnt done a story on this yet"
OpportunityNo1318,"Fuck that. BSG should ban themselves for just blindly banning a poor guy even with poor stats and legit play. If they don’t take any time to investigate then seriously something is wrong with them. 
But man, after playing Tarkov 1 year now. This BSG is something special. A special kind of stupid. 
With all my brain power I’m trying to understand how they operate and function but I truly can’t. The decisions and poor transparency they have really gets on my nerves. 
I brought me to a point that I will try whatever it takes to convince people not buying it. Not because of the game, that’s good, even with bad audio and desync issues. But just merely about BSG and their attitude and self esteem. I tried to see the best in it, but there isn’t anything."
4507862401892,Rengawr is fucking clown
IamCrash,"Well this situation is giving this streamer free publicity, that’s for sure. I didn’t even know who he was until this happened. BSG is just as much, if not more, to blame. If they in fact actually banned with no evidence is absolutely insane - hard to believe, really. I think BSG should address this situation, and this streamer needs to publicly apologize to this guy - and I don’t mean that ego induced video he already uploaded, that was not an apology."
Blacklist3d,Rengawr played victim.  He also tried to shift blame.  Such a pathetic response. All he had to do was apologize and see if he could message someone.  Simple.  But he shifted blame and tried to play victim.
nsfwITGUY19,All he’s doing now is crying about it and playing the victim card. Dude is a fucking child.
MOR187,cocky streamer fear.. damn this game always surprises me in a new way
MOR187,wasn't he the guy teaching us about the bunny hop sideways exploit and how to use it? what a sherpa he is.. I hope you guys are trolling his stream
jsayer7,"He’s always been cringe. Shit personality, shit mentality. If it wasn’t for tarkov that greasy slime ball would probably be selling used cars for a living."
SpeedsterGuy,He should have his account wiped like the dude he reported.
litaoyuan,"And why does Sherpa, streamers and devs have a special icon? Why do we even need to know that? BSG want to build an upper class in game?"
F_Dingo,I watched his YouTube response. What a pathetic little worm.
Maniackilla02,"INB4 mods lock post, hello mods!"
Fluffyhitman022,I don’t watch him but regardless of a streamer saying someone is cheating or is doing something worth a ban is still BSG’s job to investigate and make sure it’s a legit ban
bobbybamf12,"Im not defending the guy but half the blame does fall on BSG for not investigating the situation before hand.  Matter of fact its worse.  You pay upwards of $150 for a game that some random dude you kill has been given the power to perma ban you?  That is absolutely fucking stupid!

Rengawr still needs to make it right.  Step #1 should be buying the guy hegot ban another copy of EOD."
BullHorn7,"Devil’s advocate: I don’t think his intent was malicious, he was genuinely trying to get cheaters banned. 

The responsibility is on BSG to double and triple check such reports, the same way they should if a random person reported a cheater.

A video clip is not enough proof because desync and lag make things look suspicious."
Brave_Strawberry_238,He should be fucking banned and his twitch account deleted
,[removed]
Akuro-,He’s a good player don’t get me wrong and I do watch some of his videos but sometimes how monotone he is makes me bored very quickly
TsTyCZ,"I mean... probably not his fault to abuse power he shouldn't have ever gotten in the first place really.  


It is pretty sad normal players have absolutely no way of proper reports outside of the ""cheating"" on death screen (which I highly doubt does anything).  


Just sad to see things like this happen and some random poor emissary having to fix those things. Imagine if the banned guy never said a word in here... Do you think BSG support would reply to his ticket? Highly doubt it :D   


Somehow all this incompetency is still accepted in 2023 140USD game"
Insso,"seems to be alot of shade towards rengawr, would the situation be different if it was pestily? genuinely curious now"
,[deleted]
Certain-Mulberry9893,"This is bullshit. Yeah, Rengawr is responsible for keeping himself… calm? If you’d like to frame it that way. But he also basically just acted the same way 90% of this subreddit would; he raged, reported, then ran it back. The only reason he’s getting so much heat is cause he did it on stream. 

Bsg should be the one who’s blamed for just saying “oh, he killed Rengawr, he got reported, let’s ban without any checks”. Did Rengawr rage report? Yes, and he shouldn’t do it, just like all the other players in this game. Does he rage report from time to time? Yes, as do ALL THE OTHER PLAYERS IN THIS GAME. He also “states” that he did the same type of report as everyone else. 

BSG should still go through the same process for banning people no matter who reports, it shouldn’t be the fault of a salty gamer if someone gets banned by the game’s trash anticheat/employees.

Edit: My bad, he did have a direct report, so I’m wrong on that. But even still, BSG shouldn’t ban someone on the basis of “just trust me bro”, even coming from a streamer."
ConanThedes,https://youtu.be/gGJYU3yEhiE - his side
ModsAreSoftAF,"Lmao, this shit is so ridiculous. I don’t even like Rengar, don’t even follow the guy. However, he isn’t the one that issued the ban, BSG is. His report was perfectly reasonable from his POV, and the guy claiming to be falsely banned didn’t get banned purely on the word of one single streamer. He was reported and based on that, and for all we know there could have been many other times, and BSG issued a ban. The guy that got banned had no evidence to prove otherwise and y’all are just believing some complete random on the internet at his word. 😂🤣 
Is Rengar a crybaby tool-bag? Yes. But, BSG is to blame if there’s any blame to be issued out at all. Stop the witch-hunting bullshit and grow the fuck up. Look at the situation objectively instead of “I don’t like this guy so fuck him.”"
Countcristo42,"What the hell is this insane take - he reported something that from his perspective looked like cheating (entirely fair) and then BSG responded horribly (because of course they did)

Reporting suspected cheating is the right thing to do? Obviously?  


Edit - To elaborate on this a bit - here's how I see the series of events:  


Rangawar sees what looks like cheating (watch the clip, it does) - it wasn't cheating - he reports it directly to BSG through a backchannel - BSG fucks up, does some kind of crap review or no review at all and bans the player  
Clearly the fuckup here is on BSG

Further to that - it's actually good IMO for streamers (probably sherpas too) to have a ""priority report"" function, one that is looked at first - because these are (usually) trusted community members who are less likely to abuse that function than your average account. But OBVIOUSLY BSG needs to actually review the reports, not just act on them"
usprocksv2,"if you die in a suspicious way whatsoever would you report the person killing you ? yes or no, thats as basic of a question i can ask"
SourceNo2702,"I don’t think he’s actually done anything wrong here. He didn’t use any kind of “direct line” to ban a player, he just hit the report button. Which BSG then used in the background to ban the guy with little review. Rengawr had no way of knowing that this would happen, and any reasonable person would make the assumption that BSG would take the steps necessary to not ban a legitimate player.

Like, the fuck is he supposed to do? Not report people?"
Phaazed,This sub needs a no witch-hunting rule. We don't need 5 threads on this garbage. Like really who cares about the streamer. Ban decisions are entirely on BSG. Them talking to streamers isn't the problem here.
Mediocre-kiwi-6368,Yall acting like he banned him. Quit being braindead. He sent the evidence to BSG and they banned the player. Its on BSG not Rengawr in the slightest. If we lived in a world all you morons that are blaming Rengawr - cops would be throwing people in jail for life cause we asked them to arrest someone.
Bazeface,He should lose Sherpa because the guy killed him through a wall from his screen? You’re lying to yourself if you don’t think you’d report it. Besides BSG are the ones with the ban button and he asked them to look into the account. They don’t always listen to reports as I’ve seen Rengar report people before and the same guy kept killing him for weeks with obvious hacks
TheGentileGiant,Did he do anything wrong beside reporting someone he merely suspected?
,[deleted]
linkindispute,"Why should he lose his Sherpa? I report sus people as well, its not the problem with the person, the system is stupid."
BlitzfireX,"I’d be willing to argue that his stream does more to help new players than most sherpas. His “abuse of power” is likely more related to streaming not his Sherpa status. 

Also, if I was getting some suspicious shots on me, id probably do the same thing to try to clean up the game. He’s probably made a few mistakes but I doubt the dude is trying to ban innocent people on purpose. I for one am happy that at least a few streamers are helping get rid of the cheaters. 

The fact that BSG doesn’t investigate better is on BSG, not on rengawr. I think y’all are mad at the wrong person/group."
artosispylon,"il be honest i feel like rengawr is getting way more hate than he deserves for this, yes he might be a cocky asshat streamer but it really did look like the guy was cheating from his PoV and it s BSG who provided these dogshit servers and then banned based on a clip that happend due to the dogshit servers, rengwar just forwarded a clip of something that 100% did look like a cheater from his end, bsg should have done a better job confirming it.

i would have reported the guy myself if that happend to me"
Kswan2012,People are just going to hard on the guy. Missing the total point of the Reddit post. Bsg should take 2 seconds to look at account to see if it’s suspicious. That’s it. You ratting in a bush and shooting a gigachad in the legs will not get you banned… fucking floating around at the speed of light should though. Blame bsg not him…
wlogan0402,#ADMIN ABOOSE
Rokexe,"I saw the replay from rengawr's perspective, and i would have thought it was a hacker too.

BSG needs to get their shit toghether with hackers. 

They need to build a replay engine, where you can rewatch a game from all perspectives (similar to league of legends). That will help lower reports, because you can easily see if they are cheating or not before reporting. And of course, help the ones in charge of banning make a better call.

This should have been added years ago. I guess its really hard at this stage, but they really need to take a wipe-long period to fix issues (operation health type of deal).

Rengawr is clearly responsible for this, but BSG is to blame, for the insta ban and not providing staff and players with adequate tools, manpower and procedures.

If they dont give him his account back, I guess rengawr should gift him an eod copy as compensation for taking away his account.

Just my two cents."
FullMetalAlex,A streamer actively making a game worse? Shocked pikachu face
selelee,"man who gave the ""power"" to him was BSG. the problem is with them not rengwar. they just have to review their policies, public relations, bug dealing, customer service."
Nice_Lingonberry_764,"That guy Rengawr is just an asshole not someone I watch because of his negative attitude and we can add the little shit HyperRatTV, that little boy bans me for sharing my opinion in his chat because he was shitting all over Rengawr on his twitch channel and I shared a different opinion. Snowflake liberals I swear. Oh well not my loss…. #unfollowHyperRatTV"
Turtvaiz,Brother it's BSG/BE that ultimately banned the guy. BSG taking Sherpa away after they fucked up would be even worse
Twigwithglasses,First hour of post and [removed]
ExoticPerception6,"The anger towards BSG can not be contained, we must crucify the streamer now."
Seanydelight,Eh he’s trying to get cheaters banned and the clip looked sus af ik ur mad at him but you just are mad at all streamers

SuperRektT,Why should he lose his sherpa because using the same feature as you called REPORT with the only difference that they manual ban him because of p0tat0 knows.
somenoefromcanada38,"This whole situation just bothers me today I brought a mosin to streets at night killed 1 out of a 2 man and got called a cheater. Imagine if that was a streamer, I'd be banned right now. Makes me not want to play the game since the better you get at it the more likely a chance you kill the wrong person and get banned lol"
Fgw_wolf,A dude that bad at the game is a Sherpa!?
Bigwaynekerr,Just stop viewing him. Might not have as much sway on 5 viewers…
DuckInCup,"Streamers who have a ""main"" game are usually pretty brain dead aside from a few obvious exceptions."
blindhollander,"Idk who  rengawr is, never seen him. And well now I never will"
malapropter,I personally don't care and will not be affected by any of this in any way.
BL_RogueExplorer,"I agree with you that there was an abuse of power. 

However, your question of, “…why play?” Doesn’t really make sense. If you get banned by a random dude with some power then you can’t play, but if you stop now then you play even less. I get what you were trying to say but these situations are few and far between. Quitting the game because you are afraid you might get a bs ban is ridiculous. 

That like saying why go to work if I might be fired for some bs reason."
Overcast206,This subreddit is a joke.
Fgxynz,Watch the vid he made. For all we know he could be cheating and got banned rightfully. Stop trusting random guys on Reddit it will only lead to bad things
stevencri,"Never knew who Rengawr was, but I've been following the drama.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, he reported a guy that he thought was cheating. If you saw his POV, it looked like cheating. The guy was on a left-hand peak and absolutely should've been seen by Rengawr. There's not even foot steps for the guy pushing.

He reported the guy cause he thought he was cheating. Whatever route he used, whatever, he **reported him to BSG.** He didn't press the ban button. He wasn't the one to review the raid logs. BSG did whatever their process is, and they banned him. Maybe he was given injustice during the process, we don't know, because BSG does the banning, not Rengawr. Its not Rengawr's responsibility to review his reports, just like how its not our responsibility if we report somebody. If BSG is just trusting Rengawr's word without reviewing the actual game logs, that's BSG's fault and not Rengawr's.

**Not to mention that there is literally 0 proof that this guy wasn't hacking. He made a reddit post, and news flash, people will lie if they lose a $100+ account. I'm not accusing him of a cheater, in fact I believe he probably wasn't because he sounds genuine, but sounding genuine is not proof that hes innocent.**

Hold BSG responsible, not this man. This guy doesn't deserve hundreds of negative comments and death threats for something that BSG did."
