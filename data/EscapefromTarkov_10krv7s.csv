ShadowSlayer210,"Dear Sam , it hurts my heart to know you are no longer with us you were a great friend , you always knew how to make us laugh , I will never forget the long nights and early mornings we spent talking and gaming.  I know everyone has To go sometime , but God damn why do the coolest people have to go first. I miss you Sammy , Fly high brother."
Radioplay,"Firstly, I'm sincerely sorry for your loss. 

Secondly, you are an excellent writer and are great at expressing yourself. 

I used to read posts like these all the time and felt sympathy for sure but would continue scrolling as ""that's just life."" 

I also used to ride and was in a motorcycle accident that I shouldn't have survived, but somehow I'm still here. And I've been dealing with some pretty overwhelming mental weight ever since.

 So posts like these resonate with me now, and I burst into tears reading them. 

Your friend is lucky to have someone who cares so much about them, and I thank you for sharing this with the community. I hope you take care of yourself and cherish those memories."
BonkCat,I wasn't ready to feel these emotions

slirpo,"I'm sorry for your loss, friend. I'm probably not anywhere near as much of a chad as your late buddy, but if you're ever looking for someone new to raid with, feel free to send me a pm. Hang in there. Your friend is in a better place now, likely playing a heavenly version of Tarkov better than we could ever dream of. My thoughts and prayers go out to you."
Vodspod,seeing an important and detailed message like this makes me sad that I have such a poor attention span.

DzelzisZnL,"Sorry for your loss, and I hope, that writing this made you feel a bit better.
As for your friend, he will be dearly missed, and, hopefully, kept in memories forever.

He finally escaped Tarkov and now is counting loot in Heavens hideout,where all raids end happily, desync and cheaters is not a problem and PS ammo can be freely bought.

Rest in Power, raider!"

May he head eyes everything wherever he is now."

I will try and get as many kills as i can today and all will be in his name. Rip."
140rats,"Beautifully written post op. I feel like each and everyone of us can relate to having that chad friend, those of us who know others that play the game. This isn’t just a loss for you but the entire tarkov community. RIP"
qdubbya,"I’m not crying, you’re crying! 

“I play every raid like I’m already dead…” Great mindset that I’ll have to adopt. 

Last wipe I had multiple slicks and Meta weapons I never touched. Just collected dust. Later I’ll hop on and load up my best gear and see if I can Chad out in honor of him."
mikeyboy1681,"Sorry to hear about the loss brother. Video games as a medium extend far beyond what's on the screen. Some of the best friends I've ever made in my life have been through video games. They are my family and I would do anything for them, I can only imagine how hurtful this must be to you."

drastik,"My condolences go out to you, sir.

I lost my mom Christmas morning. You were spot on when you said the grief and denial that sets in is hard to deal with, even for us that have always accepted death for what it was.

Your friend sounds like a great human and gamer... and you also are an amazing person for taking the time to share your thoughts and stories about the matter. It takes courage, but more than that strength. Stay strong for yourself, because that's what your friend would want for you. Remember not only the good times, but the bad as well that brought you closer together. Every time a scav kills you in game, think of it as your friend jabbing at you.

Again, my condolences sir.. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to reach out. I'm always willing to be an open ear for anyone.

ASelfie,"May he rest in peace, we sometimes rage and insult each other on a game until we realise there are very good people behind the screens that are just here for banters, i would've love to met him the way you described him"

boopunex,Sorry  for your loss...He sounded like a real CHAD!
fortnitebum,Sam the cruel irony of this world presents itself at various times. I remember you and I talking about riding our motorcycles to daytona and I sincerely regret that I put it off and now we could never do it. Although our time together was brief I will always remember you and you will always be a part of our team we put together. I did not think it would end like this but none of us ever do.
PvDWarden,Damn this story made me realize we all have dear online friends. Friends we met online that we can pour our hearts to. Friends we will probably never meet but friends that become family.
