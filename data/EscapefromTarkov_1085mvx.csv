ThatGamingMoment,"And just like that, they're addicted"
DrFloppyTitties,Dude has played for 5 hours tops and has a melee kill. I've been playing for thousands of hours and I got my first one at the end of last wipe during the event.
noob-teammate,"""and went straight to the extract after killing 1 scav and boy was that a rush.""

i miss this!"
EstablishmentCool197,"Like Pestily said in his latest vid, as a new player, your primary objective should be getting from spawn to extraction and that’s it. Great if you take some loot along the way, otherwise it’s alright."
justChris4u,"Yes such interactions are quite rewarding - you are totaly right. My biggest game changer was, when i used the hole time on the map. Means: Just be calm and play slow. Don‘t run so much and be patient. Listening is the key and if you have no good weapon just don‘t attack the other player. At least you should now how you weapon is opperating and you should use the good ammos if you get hands on it. For eduction you should look vids about budget loadouts. Hope you find something helpfull"
Vjekov88,"The first wipe is always the most tedious experience, keep doing what you're doing. You'll end up finding out what works out for you. Next wipe you'll do the same things 10 times faster because of the game knowledge."
MortVader,"Nice job with the stabbing :D I can imagine that must have been a rush!  


So did you get back and get Jaegers note, and extract, later?"
MyOtherDogsMyWife,"Can I give you some unsolicited advice?

I played this game for years. While I never had the time to get past the mid 40s in any wipe, I've well cleared a thousand hours, just for some context.

My advice is very simple. Don't listen to anyone talking shit on this subreddit, and enjoy the game. 

Tarkov has a lot of problems. This is glaringly obvious. But the complaints you are seeing are from people with a good amount of time into the game, who want the best for it. I don't play anymore for my own reasons, but i would never say that it isn't worth trying. People over the 500-1,000 hour mark seem to forget A) what it is like to be new, wide eyed and innocent in the Tarkov world and B) that getting over 500 hours of play time out of a game is really spectacular. 

I've been thrilled with single player experiences that I've payed $40 for and gotten 20 hours out of. The value in Tarkov is phenomenal, as long as you contextualize it. There is a ton to learn, and it feels great to improve. Yes, you could call the amount of information required to feel competent intentionally obtuse to keep up player retention, but you can easily spin anything subjective into a positive or negative based off of context. 

Again, I will gladly admit that this game has it's flaws, and they are glaring enough that I don't feel the want to return to it as it sits, but don't let my opinion or the opinion of any other grouchy Tarkov vet muddy the waters for you.

Escape from the Escape from Tarkov subreddit, enjoy your time with the game while you can, and good luck out there. Tarkov is a phenomenal concept for both gameplay and the gameplay loop, and it's very easy to commit to and really tear into if you want a meaty, challenging FPS.

Also, if you choose USEC, you're on the wrong side of history."
Twofingers_,"1) You will die, ALOT, its part of getting better and its normal
2) Always try to have cover, its not COD, you need to guard your body and head as better as possible
3) Always do your scav runs on timer
4) Learn the maps and the extracts
5) Watch youtube videos for new players
6) You will experience cheaters and desyncs that will kill you, be ok with that
7) Do your quests as priority in order to level up fast and unlock better gear
8) Factory is a very good map to get good at pvp but dont hurt your money
9) Watch streamers and observe what they do and their map awareness
10) Most important rule, you need to survive, not to kill PMCs so if you can avoid fights for now, do so.

Have fun!

Edit: Always use headsets, the sound is the most important even thought currently is not the best, you will have many options and you need to find which one works best for you."
Straikkeri,"Welcome to tarkov, friend. Don't mind reddit, it's always like this. Enjoy the game. It's not even nearly as bad as reddit makes it seem."
Graematter,"It will serve you (and others) well to post about your experiences every few months, but absolutely stay away from the game's posting/social media community. There's so little value in the hate and negativity that is constantly shared by so many. Fine what you enjoy, and stick to that. Welcome to Tarkov."
blindhollander,Save your self the sanity and remove your self completely from this sub Reddit and come back in a year. This sub is a toxic cesspool that adds nothing of value it's just shit posting and a place for complaining. YouTube tarkov there's some great guides and content creators....the only useful thing here is the user generated maps. That could just be googled anyways
He-is-climbing,"This is my first real wipe after a few attempts since 2020 where friends would try to teach me that ended with ""Tarkov isn't fun"" after just a few raids, and I am having an absolute blast. Killing sniper scavs with my OP-SKS while my homie is pinned down, interacting with my fellow scavs on those runs (one dude dropped me painkillers and adrenaline after I lamented that some psychopath shot out my legs and left me to limp), and just today I took a 100k mechanic-value AK (that I looted from a PMC) into customs with my duo and killed 3 PMCs in dorms before dying simply because I went greedy, didn't bring enough clips, and ran out of ammo for the 4th guy. We had a moment where we simultaneously realized I had no more ammo and it was a funny exchange over comms. My only regret is rushing him with my knife instead of attempting negotiation lmao, but it was absolutely exhilarating. I've got like 25-30 hours in this game already in the first week of joining the wipe. 

This game scratches the shooter itch unlike any other shooter I've ever played. Despite being billed as high-stakes and high-intensity game, the community is actually pretty great and non-toxic (except on reddit, where it seems the chaff and negativity really floats to the surface.)"
refuzeUS,"Yup, I am in same exact situation, just started week ago and I am having a blast every single session I play, then I come here and see nothing but complaints and toxicity, which I guess I understand with game being quite old and a lot of players experienced multiple iterations of the game. 

But none of that matters to me, I have been gaming for about 20 years now and nothing has ever produced same kind of adrenaline rush this game gives you with danger around - I absolutely love it. So for the past week I have been eating, drinking, sleeping and shitting tarkov, its so so addicting. Good luck in your journey and happy learning, we both have a lot to do."
legalrick2,"Also a completly new player here. Whats the best map to start on? I tried shoreline but got spawncamped literally 2 minutes into the game. And ive had a couple goes on factory, but it just seemed like a money waste to throw my PMC in with 1 makarov each time and die each time."
Xiemos,Your balls are larger than mine. I have this urge to play and learn the game but feel like I need someone to hold my hand.
KevinsLunchbox,"Welcome to Tarkov. Now it's time to Escape from Tarkov.

My first raid I went to Factory because I heard it was small and I figured it would be easy. I got clapped by a gamer and he got a full Timmy loot of my M4A1, armor and helmet and headset and a bag FULL of food and drinks and water and fleece and other shit I thought I would need including an secondary mp5 iirc and a pistol. 

Man murdered a child in the crib. I was terrified."
Stanleys_Cup,I’m a newer player this is my second wipe. When learning the maps it took me way too long to realize that a lot of the maps you find online aren’t oriented with north up. Customs in particular is upside down. So if you can’t get your bearings straight with a compass that’s why
kmofosho,"We bitch and moan, but that’s cause we love the game and want it to be as good as it can be. Truth is there’s really nothing like it. Welcome to Tarkov!"
PCM_God,"Hanging around this sub as a new player is probably not a super good idea if you wanna actually have fun with the game. The sub's full of the ""loud minority"" and thus most of the posts these days are super negative."
kkuntdestroyer,"Just remember, people who are having fun are usually playing the game and not making posts on reddit. People who aren't having fun are more likely to come and make a post"
Breezzzayyy,Remember when? Pepperidge farm remembers
EvilHakik,Masochists unite!
gladbmo,"Welcome to Tarkov, you're going to have a bunch of ""fears"" you need to get over (because they are superficial at best).  
Mainly:  
-Fear of dying.  
-Gear Fear (Kind of the same as the Fear of dying but tied to losing 'good gear')  
-Survival Fear (Extracting too early because you got into a fight, but you end up leaving the raid without really looting anything or completing a task making the entire run pointless)  
  
Good luck."
Significant_Dish5445,"if youre looking to play with anyone LMK im level 14 at the moment and have like 500 hours on the game, im definetly not the best but i could at least set you on the right path"
suteac,"The reddit is pretty doomer, so don’t let everyone here scare you from the game. Tarkov definitely has problems, but let yourself decide what they are.

I personally am still enjoying the game, although I wouldnt mind some QoL changes"
puppetpenguin77,"It's always nice to have a good fight with a fellow bad player, I hate insta headshots in this game and avoid PvP for that, but oh when you both have nothing but a will to live and some crappy scav killing gun the fights can getting, especially pistol fights. Had a raid on factory where I was screaming while being chased by a player scav to extract after having a crazy fight. Literally the most pumped up I've been in a game.

Glad your enjoying your wipe despite all the negativity and bullshit"
Sideshow-Blob,"Dude, I had literally had an almost exact experience. Doing the same quest with only a pistol and on my way to extract. Cross paths with a PMC and unload an entire mags worth into them. Managed to get the kill on the final shot....go to reload, turn around and there's an even more juiced PMC aiming a Moisin at my head. Didn't end well but damn, it was exhilarating."
MattAwesome,"Enjoy it. People always talk about how to get over gear fear/get better, but I miss that rush when I started this game."
Robathor777,"Check out a video on settings - graphics and keybindings. Some stuff like PostFX can bigly change the way the game looks. I like a little PostFX to brighten up colors and sharpen everything a bit. There are some cool tricks with keybindings that can really optimize your play.

For example, when you ADS you can hold your breath with.. shift? L Alt? Not sure because I changed it a long time ago. Here's what I did - you put ADS to right mouse button PRESS and hold breath to right mouse button RELEASE. This means that when you click and release the right mouse button you will be ADS and holding breath, making for easier aiming. 

Another good one is for your meds. You need something to stop light bleeding and heavy bleeding, right? I put my heavy bleed med as hotkey 4 PRESS and my light bleed med as hotkey 4 RELEASE. So when I press and release 4 it will try to stop a heavy bleed first, and if no heavy bleed it will try to stop a light bleed. Basically putting both your meds on the same number (4) but one is used on PRESS and one is used on RELEASE. 

Watch a video for this and I'm sure it will be explained better. There are quite a few little tricks like this that will give you a tiny advantage. It's better to just start out this way, rather than having to ""unlearn"" something - like having to remember to hold your breath when aiming. 

Good luck"
Miji_666,"Tips for beginners:
1. Get a map on a 2nd screen or on your phone and learn the maps
2. Know what weapon you are playing, where are your advantages and disadvantages (long range or close quarters?)
3. ALWAYS check the firemode at the start of the raid. I died way too many times cause i forgot to turn it on full auto.
4. Check ammo stats and know what your ammo is capable of. Theres ammo that has a high penetration value, that is able to fight against armored guys, and there is ammo that has crazy high dmg but (nearly) no pen at all, like hp and rip for example. U want to shoot unarmored body parts with that. Legs are a good target. Underappreciated imo.
5. Learn the weapon sounds, so you can decide whether u can handle the fight with this opponent or whether he should be avoided
6. Left peaks put you in a disadvantage. Always try to right peak!
7. Turning on the spot is louder than turning while moving
8. Always keep ur fun while playing, and stop when u get frustrated. It will only go worse from that point. That goes pretty much for any game, but tarkov especially

Feel free to ask anything tho (even people ongame, most of them are happy to help) :)"
MrNonNon,New player here too. I just started yesterday.I’ve maybe played three pmc runs and died all three times lol. The only time I’ve extracted was on a scav run where I got a nice gun from some guys body 😭
Swampdonkeys69,"Don’t listen to all the haters, it’s a fun game and I’m glad you are having fun. People need to realize that this game is on not finished in the slightest and that what was once common place will in the future be a relic of the games development."
sneak_king18,"Don't associate your manhood with your playstyle. Make the best decision for the scenario you are in. What is the best decision? That's up to you. No wrong decisions, only the right decision"
LocusShadow,"The key to winning almost any gunfight is map knowledge and position, followed by what ammo you bring. Welcome to Tarkov, nothing else is equal to it"
Brawl_Stars_Fan123,"I am a new player too actually, I found one thing myself which is quite useful. I don't know if someone mentioned it already but there's a app on Google play store which is called just ""tarkov map"" or something very similar and it's basically a mobile version of mapgenie. It's very easy to use because you don't need to tab out and you can select so it only shows like extracts or only shows caches or shows both at the same time. It even has pictures for things such as extracts so you know 100% where you need to stand. It's really useful, heavily suggest it. I am seriously thinking about buying the ""pro"" version of the app."
WH4L3_88,"I just try and remind myself that this game is a WIP and that maybe one day it’ll be a solid game.

Think of the game as an unfinished house that has a really, really strong foundation but it’s missing the roof and it’s always raining and now there’s mold everywhere.

I always say “when Tarkov is good, it’s great! But when it’s bad it’s really, really fucking miserably bad.”

I just hit 800 hours this wipe. I guess I like abusive relationships."
Juking_is_rude,"The absolute most basic advice I can give is that your bullets matter, not your gun - check out eft-ammo.com. Your gun stats effect recoil and control, but your bullet is what determines damage and armor pen. Typically, more AP is better. A good gun with bad bullets won't kill anything, a stock gun with good bullets is very lethal. That being said, you can still use low AP ammo to drill out their legs.

Also, play with a map open on a second monitor, tablet or your phone. Map genie is a good option for most maps, but you have to pay for a few - I use the wiki for those. You need to be able to extract or playing is kinda pointless. There is an offline setting where you can explore the maps a bit and try exfil-ing before you try the map online."
GrigiBoi,"Its pain, discussed as pain and i love it"
Fit_Arm_7225,Download battle buddy app that’s the easiest ammo chart I’ve found that I use to see what ammo is actually worth using remember 99% of the time the ammo is the only thing that matters rather than the gun
Princesse_LaStar,"It's okay dude, for me the 'bad' parts of tarkov only showed up after few hundreds of hours."
MrJamesUp,"Don't worry op. Start of every wipe always fills the Reddit with hate posts. I'm not denying faults exist, they most definitely do exist. However it's hyper inflated in Reddit. 

The game is still incredibly fun and addicting. But don't expect to be good straight away or any time soon. The game probably has the highest skill gap in modern shooters"
OddSensation,"I was the same way at first! 45 minute raid? I'm taking 44. I was exacting with loot and gear but not winning fights.

I only took on fights where I could 1 tap, if I didn't get the one tap,[ then I'm ghost.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/102/822/616.jpg). I always focused quest and items then kills. 

Then I found my lord and savior the (shift + w) and youtube clips."
UnseriousSam,"Mate, do not worry about the countless posts on this subreddit trashing the game if you're new. Most people you see complaining here have more than a thousand hours on the game, of course the honeymoon phase has passed and they only see the cracks and imperfections. 

&#x200B;

Enjoy the game for what it is and play it the way you find the most fun. For me, getting the hang of it and seeing myself become better as well as feeling like i'm progressing by getting tasks done and upgrading my hideout was what i liked the most my first wipe."
Martin_RageTV,"I have played for years and years now. There has always been a vocal section of the community that is really pissed at something. There are some things I do not like about how Tarkov is now but overall it is a very much improved game that provides a unique and thrilling experience. 

&#x200B;

Only game to ever have my smart watch warn me about my heart rate."
der_m4ddin,Ur First 3 wipes are fun than the game gets Worse and boring
Confident_Bat6581,"If you are low level, you could try to run ammo that has high chance of bleeding and spray Chads in the legs. Some low level ammo won’t do anything to an Armor 4 and up. 

Play it slow, hide, listen, aim for quests as it’s the best way to level up"
Niggonatohr,The posts about the problems are made mostly by veterans who dumped a crazy amount of hours in the game. You will get your fair share of wins and progress If you are patient. I'm not a good shot at all and i play only 2 hours a day. I have a good time since the alpha
justice_Cx,may i ask you what your pc specs are?
IAMM4RTY,"Agreed! Bought this game after years of hesitation. Friends play it, I wasn't in the vibe for a game like this. 

But then I got it. And oh hell. Give me more. I started doing weird random maps until I died over 10 times. At that point I wasted most of the free gear I got at the start, and started learning the Shoreline map. Quite good, since it got many landmarks. 

So for the first couple of hours, I just went to the outskirts. Looted and became a bit more comfortable with the exits. Which ones to avoid, which ones are fine and where NOT to get shot by snipers. 

At this point, I still don't get how to get in the boat, but I did manage to bring in some wealth. And at this moment, I'm going in the more crowded areas. 

I wish I could write more, but my scav timer is done. Take care, don't die too often and enjoy the game!"
Johnny_B_Naughty,Welcome
aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,"What do you feel is your weakness in Tarkov I'll try and aim some specific tips to help you improve.

My credentials are that I've played this game way too long and conned too many friends into buying it, getting them hooked, then watching them realize what the development is going to be like.

Love to help though."
eriksprow07,"I started my self last saturday and i only did runs in tye warehouse map to get use to fighting and learn a small map....this past weekend i did alot of runs on interchange to get loot and money. This week my missions are all on customs and that is what i will be learning. Also i am going to be trying more night runs, dont get me wrong i loved downing a player and taking his silenced sks and amazing loot(for me) but i have had more deaths from not extracting in time then other players."
MrSadCord,"I hope you have better luck thank me.
I left after realizing just how much grind is in this game to unlock stuff to buy."
ploweroffaces,As a new player it's a good strategy to just try to move from spawn to extract. Maybe kill a scav or 2 and loot if its on the way. It lets you learn how to move through the map effectively. Then just set one objective at a time for each match you play.
Key_Transition_6820,"Don't worry about most of them negative neds. Most of them really don't know what they want in terms of slowing down people that play this game like a job. They don't want them to have good shit early, but to stop that they have to take away good shit from everyone. Most complain about that than the real issues eft has. They needs to just accept that sweats and streamers are a natural disaster thats just going to happen and you can't really do shit about it without hurting yourself. 

&#x200B;

Enjoy the game and its learning curve, you will get better every wipe. Know that every guide you watch if you look at the views that's how many people are doing the same shit. Its ok to be a rat, but don't stay a rat or you wont get better at the game. There are multiple people that can help you with your quest by taking you through the maps. So if you need that its there, I think they are the green names in raids. Join a discord and met some people to play in a squad with for your first wipe, you will learn a lot quicker and die less in a party."
Cortgod,As long as you’re having fun don’t mind anything you see on Reddit
Darth_Jones_,">also if you have any tips for beginners that'd be nice.

Do alot of offline raids at first. To get good at fighting you need to do it over and over again, and if you keep fighting in online raids that means dying and losing gear."
GearSpooky,"Every single game has its problems. Don’t let a vocal minority on a subreddit discourage you too much. 

Welcome to the party my friend, and happy raiding!"
Jaykahtsby,"""went straight to the extract after killing one scav and boy was that a rush.""
Man, that's beautiful. 
The best tip I can give you is enjoy learning. Don't rush to learn meta builds and playstyle. The most fun I had in this game is when I was trash and I'd kill one PMC with better gear then me and shit myself all the way to extract."
AzraelAzurite,"Wait until you're creeping around woods and you get your helmet pinged, it's a whole new level of rush"
BlakeIsaCookie,"Here's the thing...

You're going to die. A lot. As a new player, it's going to happen, as seasoned veteran it's going to happen. Dying is simply just part of the game.

You can definitely take measures to die less, like better armour, positioning, better guns and ammo, learning to pick and choose fights, etc... but you'll need to learn to get over your fear of losing what you have.

Yeah, it really sucks when you can't find any task items, and you finally catch one and then die, but when you DO get out, it's very rewarding.

If you play low risk, you'll get low rewards and end up behind most players and you'll find it much harder going against them, but extract when you know you've got enough."
Infamous-Part-3241,"That’s how it starts my man! (Or girl). Have fun and don’t bother with people crying about everything. The people that cry about stuff can change the game, no one is forcing them to play. The first steps in the game are so exciting and somewhat scary :D i’ve been playing around 300+ hours and im just starting to be confident with myself and losing ”gear fear”. So much fun! Good to hear some positivity in reddit finally. :) welcome!"
bloodybaronsdeadbaby,"I recommend getting off this subreddit. It won’t really help you in any way, and the extreme negativity will just turn you off of the game. If you need help learning try YouTube videos or discord servers. Good luck and have fun"
Sabahl,"The whole Tarkov experience right there.  Don't feel bad about booking it to the extract after a kill.  I spent the first three weeks of my Tarkov experience hiding in bushes!

Amazed nobody has said this yet but the best advice for new players is Read The Wiki and Join The Discord.  The official Discord has channels dedicated to new players and when you are off the starting blocks you can join the Sherpa discord for additional help."
Poosay_Slayer,New player as well. Oddly I've been enjoying the Inventory Mini Boss - which is a feature that doesn't seem to be advertised much on the website.
Omisco420,"You’re too new to really nitpick the game but yeah Deff in a terrible state right now. My advice is run scav runs and learn the maps that way so you have less gear fear on your pmc. Learning spawns and extracts is very important. Also sound is your friend, use it to locate enemies!"
reckless150681,"Hell yeah. Tarkov ruined shooters for me in a good way - there just isn't anything like the adrenaline rush of winning 1vX gunfights when half your limbs are blacked and - did I drop my mag back there, or not? The sound design, while messy at the moment and in need of serious rework, is at least damn realistic and intense as fuck in closed environments, and the muzzle flashes are hella blinding, and the sheer amount of fine motor control you need just to shoot your gun makes you viscerally *feel* the way a gunfight might pan out. Obviously, BSG needs to strike a balance somewhere between realism and gameplay, and to be frank, I don't think that balance is correct - but the reason I come back to this game despite its many flaws is because it provides that rush that no other game does."
renaldomoon,This is an incredible game when you first start playing. Enjoy the ride brother.
hansnicolaim,"I used to frequent this sub a bit but everyone just complains about shit now, thank you for sharing something positive and welcome to Tarkov."
areies88,"A good tip I was given when starting out was watch Pestily raid series on YT when not playing or off time. I started on customs but as people have said its more PvP focused then woods. Felt that was helpful as the main thing that gets you killed is PvP (altho scavs can be nutty) also if you have 2 monitors its a good idea to keep a map open on 2nd monitor as a guide to learning maps. For some maps that are more intense like reserve, maybe do an offline raid and get a feel for it, then scav it afew times before taking PMC in. I know thats super cautious but map knowledge is kind of king in this game."
immigrantMentalityZ,if u play a lot u will get better
KingintheSouthLA,"I went to fortress for the first time this wipe as I’ve finally gotten over gear fear and started trying to engage in PVP more.  I killed 4 scavs and a usec and almost won another fight with 2 bears.  It’s the most fun I’ve had this wipe after avoiding fights wherever.  I’ve lost a few fights which is frustrating, but it’s the most fun I’ve had in this game since I started in January of 22."
KnightsWhoNi,my number 1 advice: Get off reddit. You will find nothing but grief here about problems you don't realize are problems.
AntiSocial1313,"Like many others have said, it’s important to slow down. Tarkov being a fps game some people tend to run around like it’s call of duty and you’ll learn quickly that it’ll never work out. Focus on rotating during gun fights and slowing your pace down. It also helps to get in some discord groups and find a group to play with around the same level. Running around with someone a little more experienced willing to help you out makes the game so much more enjoyable. Finally, using your scav to learn maps is a good technique as well; having the map with the extracts up on your other monitor or phone is what i would tend to do when learning the maps. Starting out i would run my scav then while it was on timer, run my pmc to get quests done. Feel free to pm if you have any questions or wanna play sometime!"
Scavwithaslick,"Get something called the Kedr from prapor, any ammo works, aim for the legs"
Tremulant887,"I've been playing off and on for years and I still suck. I get an ego when I scav and run straight into death, then my asshole clenches so hard I pop a hemorrhoid when I PMC... Like oh man, don't wanna lose my 50k kit!

Keep on rocking that shit. It gets better. Not really but we stay positive."
JustMattLive_Twitch,Honestly bro you just got to keep playing the game and you will get better at pvp slowly its one of them things ive had this game since 2017 and im only just getting the hang off pvp knowing when to push when to retreat sometimes its better to run then just keep the fight going
AlwaysSunnyInTarkov,"Don't pay too much attention to the amount of complaints. The game has some big issues, but people are much more motivated to write up a post on reddit when they're unhappy than when they're happy, It's like reviews in the service industry. Enjoy your raids and good luck!"
Trill__,"I’m not sure if anyone has said this but I lived off of the Pestily Raid Series on YouTube when I was a new player. I still tune in every new season he puts out because early/mid wipe are my favorite aspects of tarkov.

I’m glad you’re enjoying it man. I wish I could go back a relive some of those early tarkov raids, they were the best."
OverBand4019,"Your not a pussy for leaving, it’s a tactical retreat."
CptBartender,"> after killing 1 scav and boy was that a rush.

This *rush* is exactly why we all [endure constantly being punched in the dick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzaNzJnh9l8)."
TheTrueQuarian,Terrible paid shill go away
GibFreelo,I'm a returning player after not playing for a couple of wipes. It took me an embarrassing amount of raids to start reliably killing PMCs again. After playing other FPS games it's muscle memory for me to go for headshots. I had to retrain myself to go for legs with shotguns for example.
Careless-Culture3305,"Just some advice from a veteran, I am level 42 this wipe. 

Do not take in valuable gear with you early wipe. The game runs rampant with cheaters and the second they see you have something they want you will instantly die.

Wait a month or so."
No_Interaction_4925,That experience is why I call Tarkov my “crack”
pylorih,Last time I got in a knife fight in Tarkov it was quite the rush - I got killed :(
TheBeanlettuce,"Hey brother, I just want to say it gets much much better as soon as you have map knowledge. There are apps on the play store, the one I use is ""database for tarkov"", I recommend it"
That-Albino-Kid,Use your scav to learn maps. Have a map up on your phone or a second monitor. Enjoy :) you will now be ruined for all shooters.
Saucyminator,"This game has very high ""highs"", there's no FPS game out there that can top it.

That said, I recognize the game has its issues and needs to be fixed/worked on.

Last time I played was 2 years ago and started again this wipe, I'm just a filthy casual. But so far it's been fun!"
keenhydra93,"You got the first objective, survive"
aSexyWaterScorpion,"Not to be that guy but dumping a full round of pistol ammo into a guy, missing most, is the epitome of an oxymoron lol"

fentanyl_frank,If you're new you should just leave this reddit tbh. It will ruin a lot of your enjoyment by pointing out everything that's wrong. Just be oblivious to it and have fun learning this game and all its weird quirks.
BloudinRuo,"Pestily just posted a video earlier where he talked about survival and extraction rates. 13 players per raid, 3-5 manage to extract, being one of those players even 10% of the time is doing well. 25% is amazing. I had never thought about it that way, but its true and it changed my perspective on survival rates.

Yes you've died 4 out of 5 raids. But that one raid you didn't, you were in the top 25% of that entire raid. Good job!"
StealthCatUK,"Keep going. Let's see if you say the same after 12 months when you die to stuff and understand that you probably shouldn't have (dsync, rubber banding).

And the BS quests you gotta do."
ClassicallySkeptical,This guy gets it
schlosoboso,the game is good despite the changes BSG has made over the last several years- they struck gold and no matter how much they try and bury it people keep looking for the gold.
Franklin_le_Tanklin,It’s an amazing game. Most people on here are snowflakes and don’t understand we are beta testing.
hondajvx,"Get off this subreddit as fast as you can. 

People here wax poetically about old wipes and how fantastic the game was, but in reality this subreddit was still a bunch of yammering bitches complaining about everything."
MisquoteMosquito,"Also, check out Zero Sievert!"
throwawaypoopgarbage,"This is the best game I've ever played, enjoy it my guy :)

The things people bitch about on reddit won't even cross your mind until you're nearly 1000 hours deep into the game, pay it no mind."
Aceylah,Everyone rats around to learn the game. Took me a long while to start confidently taking fights. Good luck!
LiveTheDream24,"I am envious brother. I remember that feeling and its SUCH a good feeling. 

Make good friends with map genie, Tarkov wiki, and ammo charts and reference them as often as you need (I still use tarkov wiki DAILY 2k+ hours in)

For all its faults there isnt another game out there like this one."
NoAcanthocephala5350,Yea my first I think 5-10 raids there was just an amazing rush I didn’t know who was shooting me or from where but even dying was so fun. After that honeymoon phase this game becomes horrible. It becomes even worse when you stop reacting to deaths
Lumpy_Upstairs8879,Stat away from reddit and just spend your first wipe learning. Use the wiki for quest help. And try to not get diacouraged
-S0lstice-,Biggest tip is to never let the game get to you. Tarkov has super high highs and extremely low lows. When you are in those lows just remember that you can always bounce back.
AverageMetalConsumer,"I actually love the state the games in right now, and I honestly think it's main problems are audio and cheaters. Other than that I absolutely love it."
Laittl,If you are interested watch pestilys raid series it really helped me a lot to understand the game more
CleatusCuckholdJohn,Glad you're liking it.  I reccomend grinding factory if you want to get better at pvp
Eduardo_Delgado33,This game is addicting but super punishing to new players. I still remember I almost quit the first week because I only extracted maybe 3-4 times Throughout the entire week. This is my second wipe and my survival rate is 60% which is a huge difference. It’s get a lot better once you learn all the places or good loot and maps and just overall become a better player. And welcome to Tarkov it’s gonna be a lot of rage inducing butt clenching satisfying moments.
Wisemagicalhags,i've always said that this game is the only game that gets my blood pumping anymore. after gaming for 10+ years this game never fails to give me that adrenaline spike
Alone_Manufacturer66,"There are way more complaints here than actual problems with the game. I’ve played almost since launch. It’s come a long way and is super enjoyable. 

I also had a pretty steep learning curve at the beginning this was also the first pc game I ever played. 

Helped me to play with a friend I think so we could learn together and both bounce different ideas and tactics off each other.  You’ll also find just time in game will help. Biggest tip I can give you is if you get in a fight don’t just stand there and try and shoot quicker and more accurate. Move around and keep them guessing."
rakraith,"You're not a pussy. 

start with small raids. 1 objective, then leave.

little wins go a long way. 

enjoy the fear, the immersion when you're new is a once in a life experience."
Sazbadashie,"So... don't listen to all the bickering here, use it as knowledge to understand the situation but after that go nuts have fun for the sake of having fun win or lose, don't get caught up in the rat race.

Welcome to the game"
H1GHF1VE_,"Oh man I love the rush and progression from this game. My first raid years ago and getting killed instantly. Finally extracting. Finally killing a PMC. Killing multiple pmcs and extracting their gear in one raid. Each step you get a little better. Many wipes later I’ve got like 30 pmc kills in like 60 raids, 60% sr as a solo. Never forget where you come from, Timmy."
tacticalxzebra,This is so similar to my initial experience lmao. Have fun and stick with it!
niarferf,W
janksnake,"Hey fellow first wiper, I'm also having fun in Tarkov :D

It clearly has it's issues, but I havent been playing long enough for them to become obvious or painful yet.

For now I am really just enjoying exploring the game and starting to learn the maps and all the various mechanics.

I've played a lot of games. In my experience, there are no games that do not suffer from bugs, performance problems, design decision flaws and all of that stuff. That's just how it is.

Anyway, my begginer tip from a beginner to beginners I learned from not-beginners! -

practice using your preferred loadout in offline factory raids, with scavs on horde, tagged and cursed if you want immediate action.

Up the difficulty of the scavs if you want more challenge.

It's a great way to get better at Tarkov movement and engagement and learning how to use your guns effectively.

Also, scaving a fair bit initially on maps you know you're going to spend some time on is a great way to learn those maps and pick up some tastey loot on the way. Also helps you learn where the better loot lives for when you're doing your PMC runs."
KookyCrazyCat,I definitely had a very similar starting experience when first getting into tarkov. I joined the EFT offical discord where there’s definitely more then enough players for each map and you’ll run into people who are willing to help you in-game with tasks and basic stuff.
stride630,Knowing what items you need for future quests and hideout upgrades is extremely useful and will save you a lot of time.

JJdisco21,"Lmao this guys plays for 30 mins and gets a melee kill, I’ve been trying for a few wipes now"
Little-Ad-6332,Bring in extra mags and loose your melee slot
JmJ3106,"fellow beginner with survival rate of 30-40 percent,

&#x200B;

Go into the game with the mindset that ur gonna die so fuck it anyways.

In those (potentially rare) raids where u do survive, often you will leave with a few guns or items to add to your stash.

Insure everything, keep to budget guns and start playing as much FACTORY as you can. It's the easiest and the hardest map, but if u learn spots u can pile up loot!!! but also the most fun.

ALWAYS BUY HEADPHONES AND ARMOUR!!!!!

Final tip:

Find the secret caches on shoreline they are easy to find. seek a guide or pictures of their locations. They really have spicy loot."
Wunon,"And another ""durr me have fun, no issue with game, all complainer skill issue he he"" post from a completely new player. 

Play a few wipes, then you'll see why we complain."
wnukson,"Mine was different - everything is bullshit that needs to be read on wiki. Even simple quests are bullshit. No map no clue where to go the game requires heavy metagaming or wasting time to figure it out alone. Even those useless maps from traders arent accessible at first. Why would they do that? I don't know.

After you accept this fact then the rest is very good until you start seeing desyncs, cheaters, poor performance and other stupid decisions like some quests."
Minasmins,If you don't want to see all the negatives just leave this sub and join [r/tarkovmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/TarkovMemes)
ElderSafe,"Trust me when i say: The more you play, the less you will happy to play it and still be addicted like a heroine junk in frankfurt mainstation"
AlwaysGamerQc,"Don't let those whining at everything ruin it for you. Yes, there are issues in this game but people here often exaggerates them or they just got unlucky.
Speaking from experience, I would highly suggest you to find a group of people that would take you in and teach you the ropes of Tarkov. There's so so many things that you can't know from just playing the game. You need to search the internet, watch many YouTube videos and have ton of experience. Starting to play this game by yourself is very very hard"
CheesecakeDiscoParty,"Unfortunately the fun will wear off pretty soon once you realize how many cheaters plague this game. After they use radar and xray hacks to track you down, they'll get to choose between shooting you through any surface, flying around in front of you taunting, or just kill you with a command and you just fall over dead. Sadly doesn't seem like BSG cares about addressing the cheaters"
Dartiboi,"Keep it up, this game has so much to offer if you’re already enjoying it :) as for the negative posts, just ignore them. This sub sucks honestly. BSG has made a ton of progress on development since I started playing. Tons of new mechanics, content, bosses, maps and expansions, etc."
