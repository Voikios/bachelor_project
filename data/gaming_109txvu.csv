HaikuBotStalksMe,"In reality: 

Me: 0 stars, 200 coins

Bowser's friend: 4 stars, 0 coins

Some other guy: 2 stars, 52 coins 


Bowser: ""this upcoming revolution is extremely fair"""
TheMikman97,"Sometimes he even just keeps them all, just like the real thing"

With the figure of 125 trillion in total world currency, divided by 7billion people that's an average of just under 18k.


*Understand that if all the money in the world that exists was evenly distributed we'd all get less than 20 thousand dollars.*


For there being so much money in the hands of so few it certainly spreads thin."

mortalomena,"Funny when people want this to ""eat the rich"". You would lose all your money and the kids in India would get pocket change"
polemistis82,"How would that make the world a more peaceful place? Taking someone's property against their will and giving it to someone else would, likely, create a lot of resentment from those whose property was taken and hostility towards those who were given said property. To make the world more peaceful by taking people's property and giving it to others would mean that all those people must be ok with and happy that their property was taken from them, or they willingly and happily gave their property away. That doesn't seem to be in the realm of possibilities."
DuduMaroja,"Bowser is comunist

Bowser is the bad guy

Communism bad"

DarkLordBalthazar,"Y'all think this is wild, but imagine doing this with Elon Musk and Bill Gates in the real world game...

whatisscoobydone,Bowser needs to read Marx's Critique of the Gotha Program.
president_gore,Comrad Bowser
BecomePnueman,You know guys the 20th century already tried this.  It led to all the best people not trying or being killed and the other people starved to death because it turns out you don't make as much when there is no incentive.
