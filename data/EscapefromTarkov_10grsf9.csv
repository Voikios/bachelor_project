AbsolutZer0_,"I am approving this as an EXCEPTION to the meme rule, since it directly relates to the game and came from [BSG](https://www.instagram.com/p/CnmuYW-Bs8z/?hl=en). 

It MAY still end up getting removed pending mod team discussion.

Normally this would get sent to the meme sub, and is NOT indicative of allowing meme posts going forward."
Malkalen,Omar's Coming Yo!
Istariel,"they also post these clips on their youtube shorts channel, most of them are great"
erik4848,"Say whatever you want about them, the youtube shorts guy is on point"
shukolade,Me and my mates had the pleasure to meet these dudes at customs crackhouse. Mind you we're level 5 or 6 so it didn't go too well for us :)
Otomuss,In reality they would've shot you 3 times with 1 bullet before you even knew they were there xD.
VonComet,new customs boss spawns?
DJDemyan,Their social media guy is a legend. Their TikTok is always fire
Jays1227,Must of not heard them because of the audio
Alirezahjt,Yea right. Like you can even see them before getting head eyed
aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,"A MEME, ON THIS SUBREDDIT! BOULDERDASH! HOGWASH! THE COMMUNITY WILL FALL APART! THE MODS ARE ON THE WAY!"
matis666,Bosses start spawning now?
StandardScience1200,Posts memes using copyrighted material yet gets butthurt and bans all discussion of a mod because “copyright”. Curious
b1inx,"i bumped into knight the other day, it didnt go well...[https://twitter.com/blinkFPS\_/status/1615387265441710080?s=20&t=QHAnikaTtysKwOfV\_RKFBA](https://twitter.com/blinkFPS_/status/1615387265441710080?s=20&t=QHAnikaTtysKwOfV_RKFBA)"

Ivandragosgopnikson,You know this game is in trouble when this is the top voted post.
Pringle24,"Cool, must have gotten all of the important stuff done!"
TheBurkhardt,That camera turn was actually incredible. Good work
jd52995,"Instagram sucks. But so does Twitter so idk which social site is good these days.

Edit: it's YouTube shorts. Don't post Instagram links and give money to mark lizardburg."
artosispylon,too bad bosses dont spawn
TrueNateDogg,Yeah this would be funny if they weren't absolute dogshit to fight at any range. Love being gated from content by literal aimbots.
Rezhyn,"Ran into them twice in a row on Customs yesterday. First time they blacked my chest but didn't chase at all, second time I killed Birdeye and thought he was a dumbass scav walking in the open and instant died to Knight. 

I really wish they carried a megaphone and talked shit into it to give people more of a heads up they are there. They are too rare to be careful about."
eXiDeviiL,I'd change Pipe Trio for a de-synced scav with shitty gear
kyle-wall-puncher,Would be a cool clip if I’d actually ever seen the goons in raid after 2 wipes and 400+ raids
wills1109,They post edits like this on there youtube all the time lol.

edit: people seems to not be in accord to this LOL"
Novarum,New boss confirmed?
Overall_Molasses4097,LOL
Monkeybreath85,"Oh no a meme on this sub, sound the alarm or else people might enjoy themselves"
WhyGuy0102,Maybe if they weren’t broken AI and actually fun to fight this would be funny
_baundiesel_,Their new map basically doesn't work but they've got memes. lol
Sublimity_Ult,Pure gold
Trick_College2491,"The trick with bird eye is you don’t see him, he sees you"
Pay-Green,It really is like the game couldn’t hear none of them coming cause the audio is trash
Select-Twist143,Me and my buddy ran into goons the other night and they layed down so much fire that I was hiding at ruins just listening to the sound of bullets hitting concrete in a constant fire
anythingfortacos,Ok so after getting smoked from 200 meters on woods (had no idea they were there) now they are on Customs too?
Kboehm,"Haha I saw that and thought man, they must have stolen that from some awesome meme creator. If they did that themselves then bravo. I love this game and haters can suck an egg."
Omena123,Okay? They post lots of memes
craftsparrow,Except these dudes would have headshot you being the back from 1000m out through 3 windows while not even rendered in...
Klientje123,"Cultists would've been a good one too, those creepy fuckers don't shoot on sight"
MiguelCC1,Yup ran into them yesterday at crack
starlot_,"Bsg aside, The social media guy has some good editing skills"
wendtcod,They should have posted this one [https://www.tiktok.com/@wannabe\_king1113/video/7184148921755815214](https://www.tiktok.com/@wannabe_king1113/video/7184148921755815214)
woodsy2323,Man now i know what to do for upvotes. Just repost BSG social content. Copy cat.
QQninja,"Side note, highly suggest watching the new Puss in Boots movie. It's actually really good."
madmann122,Fix your game...
