CSh0ck,"I took screenshots of a guy streaming cheats in my discord. I captured his player name, them being used in game and what cheats he was using. I then sent in a ticket to BSG with them attached. This was 4 months ago… he is still playing with them."
Blintszky,"A friendly reminder, the guy who has aimbotted entire lobbies whilst flying around the map and shooting through everything is still not banned this wipe. Currently level 47.

Another hacker who is similar hasn't been banned for 4 wipes and hasn't changed his name either. Good shit BSG."
ShadowZpeak,"""we banned over 800 RMT buyers""

Nice, how about banning the sellers as well?"
ReadingDits,"I saw a dude flying around on reserve night yesterday. Friendly got one tapped, guy with a massive backpack flies over and loots him. Other two of us unload into the guy and he makes all the noises like he was shot. He then flies away without shooting us so we can't report him. 

Guess he really wanted whatever my buddy had. 

We run to extract to reset and gtfo, zero damage dealt."
Previous-Vehicle-230,"This one bites my ass the most. It’s so blatant, so obvious, literally everyone knows it’s not possible to have that rep at this point in the wipe, yet they remain unbanned.

“BattleEye is working perfectly fine.” Yeah, sure."
Enthused_Llama,"Don't worry, there are still tons of comments about ""he was probably RMTing or something"" to justify the ban"
Jackal_Oddie,There was a lvl 15 on flee a few days ago who was selling 17 ledx and has the name like cccys
ZC205,"I think this is the underlying sentiment with the recent Rengawr situation. A random joe can report obvious cheating all the live long day with no results/feedback but if a prominent EFT streamer wants it done it happens even if cheating didn’t actually happen. Meanwhile accounts have flea market posts that could only have happened thru cheating every single wipe.

The way BSG manages this game and it’s community is trash. And it wouldn’t even be much of a thing if the game was shit. But it’s amazing. Or rather should be much more amazing than BSG is letting it be"
xxxZEDxxx,Someone once said they believe BSG staff is part of the RMT cheating going on and I'm more and more inclined to think he was on to something.
Hummazing,This game and BSG are the RMT cheaters making money on top of money
Minimum-Impression63,It takes 2 seconds to check the flea market for suspicious accounts. One person at BSG could do this. It would be ridiculously easy.
REDLINE70689,"I don’t get why they don’t use the flea as an easy method to investigate cheaters. I’d love to know the reasoning honestly. 

Someone 2 days into wipe selling an absurd amount of high value shit, like 20 ledx, should be an easy flag for a further look. It’s definitely suspicious at the least. 

They can play their own mini game and make money at the same time if the idiots buy new accounts. Eventually and hopefully they’ll get tired of having to buy new accounts and give up. Or at the very least it’s another obstruction in their path since there’s never going to be end game solution for them without recoding the game from the ground up."
AltNickCSGO,"That’s why I’m taking a break from the game, love the concept but implementation causes me too much frustration. Hope others have fun this wipe tho"
Cain-x,"Streamers brings money to BSG

Cheaters brings money to BSG

Legit players brings money to BSG ONCE.

Hmm I wonder what category of players is more profitable for them ? /s

We have tons of proofs over the years guys ...


It seems so hard to understand for most people, this is a real life business at the end of the day, they don't fucking care about the playerbase until it's really really hurting them and their profit.

WAKE THE F UP PEOPLE."
Ill_Story_4867,"I've been thinking of buying Tarkov finally, but, you know, maybe not yet..."
Scarity,"You know what fucking sucks most about this

>I'm a factory main, I just love it, don't hate me for it

>So I'm killing alot of 1-10 players, which I don't particulary enjoy, in ways that I think, wew, that must suck

>I'm getting reported often, pretty sure

Every time I open my pc and I see the 'you need to log in to bsg launcher, for some mysterious reason'
I think; am I banned? Did I kill the wrong guy?"
cth777,"You cannot convince me that the BSG staff is not a big part of the RMT scene. It’s the only explanation for the blatant cheating being allowed. And it goes along with the corrupt image of their country, sorry to say. 

No logic otherwise on how these guys mentioned in the OP and then the well known high level flying cheaters stay unbanned."
CanadianBear67,Here me out..... they are all working together cause they know this dumpster fire is about to blow and end. Squeezing every last dollar from us.
NotARealDeveloper,At this point it's safe to assume that they **don't want to** ban them. Now you can speculate why this is the case.
platinums99,Saw another fella with 20 intelligence for sale last night too.
Faesarn,20 flear rep ? There are people already over 80 !
PrototypeMk-1,"I personally reported someone who I used to play when we found out he cheated, I sent various video to BSG to get him banned, their answer? ""Please use the in game button to report after death""
This was 3 wipes ago, this guy still plays.
Fuck bsg"
killking72,"I'm going to probably start posting this on every thread like this. 

Stop playing, stop watching streams, and stop watching YouTube videos. 

This is so incredibly common in the industry. Want the game to get fixed? It needs to start to die."
Teftthebridgeman,So yall realize BSG is probably the ones doing it right?
Beneficial-Room5129,"It's almost like they turn a blind eye to it for some reason...nikitas pockets go deeper than just game sales, silly westerner"
iiijjiii,Yall gotta realize cheaters pay their bills
iAteTheWeatherMan,What do you think the chances these developers are in on the cheating? I say almost 100%. They are either first hand involved in profiting with rmt and taking a cut. Or they love the cheaters because they ban and the cheaters will buy a new account. They might tag some cheaters but not the ways they profit in game.
Bl1ndVe,Only the cheaters are buying new keys
easyclappers,"I had a blatant cheater, uploaded the entire 5 min encounter with pure video proof he was cheating. i got lucky cause of alytn absorbing 30 shots to the head. to this day the guy is still playing, i follow his name still. still cheating too."
LegendOfLimp,"a buddy of mine killed a sherpa last wipe and got a ban. the appeals dont even get investigated, fkn joke really but bsg is gettin sales from it so they don't really give too much of a fk"
,BSG has the weirdest relationship with streamers out of any game I've played.
Koehlo,"I'm starting to notice how shitty bsg really is, how old am I in game?"
m_agus,"My own Conspiracy:   


Cheaters and or RMT are all Devs or Dev Friends/Family Members and for them it's a steady source of income and a way to earn some Money on the side.   


This is why everything get nerfed into the Ground, so people buy stuff from those RMTs and Cheaters.   


/s"
glippi,"Nikita had a great idea, but in the end he is just a dumb fat bastard. The other issue is a large part of the community supporting him for no good reason and anything BSG related showing the lack of standards and logic, look at the BSG, the mods, the community leaders..... they are all dumb as fuck for defending anything about the game currently. The idea of the game is great and had a good run for over 5k hours, but at this point..... it is just all shit and I am not going to be one of those pathetic shits lying to itself and others for no good reason."
Kplatz,"A level 6 with 20+ ledx on the flea at that. Chinese name, of course."
SuperRektT,"So true BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUt....

&#x200B;

BSG cAnT dO AnYThInG bRo

:\]"
R0Y-BATTY,Just shows they have no anticheat other than listening to douches like Regnar.
strongest_nerd,That's because streamers aren't reporting them.
YoungFishGaming,Without a doubt BSG I’d in on the RMT rings. Can you imagine how much money they make if they take say 30% of the cheaters profit?
YacubianDevil,"I hope that fucking dingus the other day un-ironically trying to say that BSG quarantines their cheaters in specific lobbies until mass bans see this.

They don’t do shit about cheaters until *nobody* in this dumbass community can deny its a problem, ban a wave of them, then a good half of you idiots go back to the ol’ tried and true “I’ve been playing for half of my adult life and have maybe died to a cheater once” denialism.

If they want you gone, then you’re gone, if you’re not a streamer then they could give less of a shit about your experience because you’re not bringing more suckers in.

Wild how they can get someone a streamer is salty at banned literally immediately but basically tell every single person that contacts their customer support to get bent unless they come here and make a stink that everyone gets behind.

The fact that this dude was a Sherpa, you know, a community guide for noobs, and was doing shit like this literally sums up this entire game."
Verniir,"I swear at this point I'm more leaning towards if BSG are active developers of the cheats. Cause judging by the work that's been done to the game towards cheating, it's maybe profitable for them to sell cheats like a side hustle rather than making a functioning report system (Ofc I hope that's not the case and I actually do not think so)"
SpiritCrusher421,Fuck bsg and this game
GunkyDabs,Yeah horrible look tbh
aviwashere,"Wow eft really IS realistic. The big boys doing all sorts of fuckery get by the system, but your average guy gets the short end of the stick."
kUdtiHaEX,I am surprised that people just now figured out what are BSGs priorities :D
halusinati,Plot twist: Nikita is getting kickbacks from the cheat developers!
KursedBeyond,"With all the cheating and IF BSG stated they cannot stop it. How do you know the game isn’t carrying spyware in it’s code base?

I agree with others that BSG is profiting off both sides."
JWinger13,"Has anyone been killed by a guy 6RIM? Spawned as a scav on streets and saw a guy with a couch backpack about 100 meters away, I was a scav so I just pushed him I mean why not? Before I get out of the pharmacy I spawned in I died, granted he killed me in the thorax. BUT my buddy who does have an ssd (smh) spawned in later than me and spawned on the other side of the map instantly died to the same guy (head eyes) my buddy said he was flying"
MatrixBunny,"I feel BSG is in on the whole RMT selling, perhaps for certain people/groups rather than your average user deciding to get into it as well.

There are plenty of websites that literally makes tens of thousands of $'s that has ''renowned'' users that basically function as a company.

They can literally ban them as easily as I can approach them, but they won't.

Their official Discord page literally has cheaters/boosters from those websites (plus average cheaters/boosters) that still sit there since the past 3 years or so."
lonigus,Cheaters buy accounts in mass and imo multiple times more then actual new and legit players comming to tarkov. Cheaters are a massive income for BSG and noone will ever convince me otherwise.
No-Carry-7886,"I tried to post a screenshot of this exact thing of a fucker with like 42 teapots and 30 rep but apparently pictured are banned.

Yea I mean it's 100% a cheater, like physically impossible and yet BSG does jack shit."
HeardsTheWord,"Streamers bring in big money. They want to keep their streamers happy, so they did whatever he wanted to keep him in the game and streaming."
squitsquat,"A significant portion of BSGs income must come from cheaters. The only real explanation as to why they do nothing. Who knows, maybe they help develop the cheats too"
SlySanity,"A friendly reminder that BSG makes profit off of cheaters, so it is a balance to not piss them off too much in order for cheaters to use RMT and Crypto to purchase new accounts and items. It is sad but it is the truth that many Script creators for this game states constantly.   


My org has repetitively reported cheaters, two of which are streaming this wipe because they KNOW they wont get banned.   
o\_blockblizzy litterally admitted on video to using Radar for 5 wipes.  
rotsupremee admitted to using cheats during a tournament to win and ultimatum profit with with winnings."
V_Energy,Orcs being orcs
umpekakana,"I'm going to probably start posting this on every thread like this.  
  
Stop playing, stop watching streams, and stop watching YouTube videos.  
  
This is so incredibly common in the industry. Want the game to get fixed? It needs to start to die."
BustingYoBalls,"This has been happening for quite a few wipes now. Isn’t it obvious it’s just BSG flea market bots that are made specifically to keep the flea market running with high tier loot? 

Why are you guys so sure these are all cheaters? Wouldn’t it be the easiest ban if they actually were cheating?"
zDankity35,Fuck this game and their developers!
justice_Cx,I highly recommend you gather evidence of those guys and post that with your reddit post. That would've been sick.
InterlopedLooper,There must be some sort of location-issue related to hacking. I've been playing exclusively on US-West Coast servers and I've seen one thing this wipe that made me think it must've been a cheater. Definitely have not seen a single person flying or teleporting or anything like that this wipe.
LargeSticker,"I really think the game is a blatant scheme. The way they keep it in “beta” and the fact that it’s 140 for a little more room in the stash. It’s all just a fucking scheme. I bet BSG works out deals with the RMT people. They make a shitton of money off this game. If they can keep it alive enough to constantly bring new players in, then the machine continues to make consistent money for them. They just happen to be making a cool video game in the process."
XtroDoubleDrop,I'm so happy I never took the plunge on this game
RDAM_Whiskers,They already got my money but I tell everybody else don't spend there's
Volomon,"You know why right?  They probably are backed by the devs and they probably make a huge profit online selling those items.

The company might not know but these guys are living in Russia and Russia except for the elite are mostly poor.  The ability to generate not just thousands but possibly hundreds of thousands would be hard for every single dev to overlook.  So someone is in on it without a doubt."
grollypriest,Ok but how is pigkita gonna show off his new 500k car (while his 18 yr old countrymen are dying in a war and hes sipping a mimosa)  if cheaters dont give him 140$ usd a pop.
i_need_salvia,Why are people still playing this game
WayneZer0,at this point i belive the conspire theory that bsg in not only making the game but also making the cheats. would be the first time something like that happend. see for expmelm cod mobil. but cheats and game are made by daugther companys of tencent
BAShelley,"The problem is nobody reports those flea offers. To report suspicious offers like that, Right Click on the Offer ID and Click Report."
shitty_ink_doodle,"I hack in this game all the time, it’s very easy. BSG’s anti cheat and support is a joke. 

I’m surprised y’all play this Russian garbageware."
MZFN,20 rep is possible if you farm it. Over 100 is probably not
TheBadBandit1,I hope it would at least set the account for manual review. I'm sure there's an average rubel per run that devs could see and compare.
IsniBoy,"I have 13 points lf rep playing reasonably and not to make rubles, 40 would be impossible tho"
dismised_resident,They keep their marketing department happy.
wlogan0402,"I love it when someone gets unrightfully banned and there's a week long conversation about it, and then it'll be forgotten until it happens again"
Illanar,"I lost an eod account back in 2021 to a manual ban, no email or anything.  Go to login one day and get the 229.  Open up a ticket and they give me the canned “Contact BE”.  All these posts lately of false bans is not surprising at all."
DatboiBazzle,Same opening title as my post but switched up. This should be a new template for bag not fixing shit within a set amount of time. Agree 100%
Mainiak_,Can we start banning extract campers lmao
TheGuthar,if you don't kill anyone they can't ban you for hacking. big brain 1000 IQ shit right there....
WashingtonPunk,"It's not *can't*, it's *won't*. You see the same items, in the same amounts, every wipe. I can speculate all day on what I think it is, but it is obviously, 100% provable by history, not going away."
Tankeverket,"They don't actually care about cheaters.

That player wasn't banned because they think he's cheating"
TheUnd3ad13,BSG are the hackers RMTing to support there future projects. It's pure genius.
en1mal,They need to give the RMTers some time to build their stock so it doesnt dry out the reselling of the keys.
t40r,BuT gUyS wE hAvE bEsT dEtEcTiOn SyStEm *applies clown make up* -BSG
Chadgiggs,Bsg makes too much money off cheater accounts.
AxTROUSRxMISSLE,I am honestly really glad BSG is finally getting a lot of flak again
ItasteMYownPRECkUM,A dude killed me and my buddy in factory we were about 30 meters apart he shot and didn't stop shooting his mp5 and 1 tapped both of us. Kill screen said rgd5 for both of us
rbstewart7263,"Just curious yall, did we get confirmation that they were innocent? It wasn't clear to me from the video that was provided on the original post.(from the streamers perspective)"
Aidensman,Took about three hours for a guy wiping lobbies while streaming his rage cheats with the Cheat UI visible to get banned.
Travilcopter,I spawned as a scav and died with in seconds to a pmc.. the part I'm mad about is I spawned with a Ledx.. pmc knew to come right after me. Assuming he was cheating.
Longjumping_Water_74,so is there a good way to get rid of most of them or no?
ElHuntar,Just got into the game looks like at an awful time sadly with cheating bums ruining everything
Safe_Lengthiness7768,I'm tired of people that have no business playing tarkov using cheats and rmting to convince their pathetic egos that they can compete. I don't care what their excuse is they are trash players.
Mad-All-Day,Cheaters should have their fingers taken away irl. Fuckin losers.
Adeyotol,They aren’t going to do anything about the cheaters. Doing so would cut several revenue stream for BSG. They don’t care about the legit players at all. I’ve stopped playing simply because I’m not willing to risk my account by killing the wrong person. Also the cheaters are just running wild. It’s not worth it.
Pickle_Slinger,"After playing over a year I got banned without an answer on the last wipe. Tried contacting support multiple times and got nothing. Haven’t been able to play since then, but it looks like I didn’t miss much with all the complaints coming out of this update."
Religionbedumb,Game is a joke honestly.
Alloutpeachy,"Had a regular non EOD account insta kill me headshot on Reserve as soon as I spawned. In the post game, his name was RIPBATTLEYE. The disrespect makes it even more fun(depressing) I got my money's worth out of this game through a few wipe cycles, but Imagine spending $100+ now for a new player. It hasn't changed and probably never will."
Procol_Being,Rengawr exposed how bad BSG actually is
Sworn_to_Ganondorf,Hackers will forever cap my enjoyment with this game. Always around maybe level 25-32
UbFunks,DouYin with 35 flea market rep listing 50 ledx for sale is very legit what do you mean?
alostbutton,There has to be a tally system for reports on accounts right?
Lukaroast,"Cant, or wont?

You know the answer"
BLUEballdNINJA,"Hackers can see when you report them and have been rage hacking since alpha lol. Y’all don’t remember osmosisjones? This will never get better and Nikita has said he can’t do anything about it, better get comfy"
FullMetalAlex,A whole region of servers were down yesterday and not a peep
IMJohnWayne,Boom... would be the easiest manual ban job ever
No-Concentrate641,"I just upgraded my cpu to a 13900k and GPU to a 4090 yesterday , played a few raids yesterday, logged in today and 60 day banned.. Totally unreal"
Certain-Mulberry9893,"Yes, but what happens later in wipe? Is there some good way to detect rmt sellers later on after the first couple of months?"
specwolf82,"This wipe is by far the worst when it comes to cheaters, I'm done with this game for a little while."
StaticClingManXD,"Well to be fair we don't know if that person is innocent... Whether the clip itself showed cheats or not... That person could still cheat... We can't know this...

&#x200B;

So maybe when the manual look up was triggered they ACTUALLY found something sus that wasn't in relation to the clip itself but it turned out maybe the dude was a cheater...

&#x200B;

But they would have otherwise missed it... Doesn't take much to critically think, does it?

&#x200B;

Again we can't know this. Stop over-reacting to things you don't have all the information to.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day we'll never know exactly how BSG/BE handle these situations and if that person is telling the truth that they don't cheat... Regardless of the streamer/clip in question"
DependentSwimming234,"I was banned for 60 days and I don’t have a clue why, never cheated, may have abused the right hand peek (like everyone else, or the ads FOV glitch) could I have been banned for dropping kits to my homies in raid? (For example I team killed a buddy then dropped him 2 gear sets, 1 set the next raid but we both died so I brought him another kit the raid following) but I’ve never purchased items with real currency so I’m confused why I was banned, have over 1k hours, guess I’ll just play Pickleball untill March… sent BSG a support email but not holding my breath lmao"
ManKilledToDeath,I guess I'll just stick with playing the single player mod with horde and scav war enabled. Free entertainment
