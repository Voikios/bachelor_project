penguinoid,"i still remember when republicans had full control of Congress under trump and had the biggest shutdown of all time. it showed that they can't even negotiate amongst themselves (which we continue to see), and they're willing to let the whole thing crash and burn.

the wildest part was their base genuinely blamed democrats for the whole thing."
Critical_Aspect,"That was Sen Brian Schatz, Hawai‘i's senior US Senator."
Eric_in_America,"Republicans want to hold the American economy hostage so they can demand a ransom. This kind of ultimatum does not have the best interests of most Americans in mind, unfortunately, most Republican voters won't see it that way."
Saxamaphooone,"Good. Now they need to really start the messaging surrounding [the Two Santas Strategy and how these threats from the GOP are part of the playbook they’ve been using to manipulate voters for decades.](https://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/thom-hartmann/two-santas-strategy-gop-used-economic-scam-manipulate-americans-40-years/)

**“The only thing wrong with the U.S. economy is the failure of the Republican Party to play Santa Claus.” – Jude Wanniski, March 6, 1976**

“The stock market is falling, in part a reaction to GOP threats to shut down the government: it’s all part of their plan.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last week warned us that the GOP is about to use Jude Wanniski’s “Two Santa Clauses” fraud again to damage Biden’s economy and our standing in the world. And, sure enough, Mitch McConnell verified it when he said last week there would be “zero” Republican votes to raise the debt ceiling.

Yellen responded yesterday by telling The Wall Street Journal that if the Republicans force a shutdown of the U.S. government like they did to Obama in 2011, “We would emerge from this crisis a permanently weaker nation.” But the GOP is adamant: they have their strategy and they’re sticking to it.

Here’s how it works, laid it out in simple summary:

First, the Two Santas strategy dictates, when Republicans control the White House they must spend money like a drunken Santa and cut taxes to run up the U.S. debt as far and as fast as possible.

This produces three results: it stimulates the economy thus making people think that the GOP can produce a good economy; it raises the debt dramatically; and it makes people think that Republicans are the “tax-cut Santa Clauses.”

Second, when a Democrat is in the White House, Republicans must scream about the national debt as loudly and frantically as possible, freaking out about how “our children will have to pay for it!” and “we have to cut spending to solve the crisis!” Shut down the government, crash the stock market, and damage US credibility around the world if necessary to stop Democrats from spending money.

This will force the Democrats in power to cut their own social safety net programs and even Social Security, thus shooting their welfare-of-the-American-people Santa Claus right in the face.

And, sure enough, here we are now with a Democrat in the White House. Following their Two Santas strategy, Republicans are again squealing about the national debt and refusing to raise the debt ceiling, imperiling Biden’s economic recovery as well as his Build Back Better plans.

And, once again, the media is covering it as a “Biden Crisis!” rather than what it really is: a cynical political and media strategy devised by Republicans in the 1970s, fine-tuned in the 1980s and 1990s, and rolled out every time a Democrat is in the White House.”

This was written in 2021, but it could’ve been written now. Or at any point since the 70s dems have taken over. It happens every time."
Papazigzags,"In exchange for not crashing the United States economy, you get nothing,” Schatz said in an interview with The Daily Beast. “You don’t get a cookie. ... You’re just a person doing the bare minimum of not intentionally screwing over your constituents for insane reasons.”

Asked about GOP calls that Democrats join Republicans at the negotiating table, the Hawaiian senator added, “We have to tell them there is no table.edit. No fucking tables"
Charm_City_Jangles,"Stock market drops 20%, GOP gets an earful from their billionaire overlords, and debt ceiling issue resolved. 

Let it play out."
sedatedlife,The debt ceiling is not new spending its financial obligations that both parties in the past have already passed and signed off on. If they waned to cut spending they should have not voted for past legislation in the first place.Not raising the debt ceiling is like refusing to pay youre mortgage.
throwaway_ghast,Somehow the media will spin this as Democrats' fault when shit inevitably hits the fan.
thepotplant,I see news about this exact thing happening about every year or two. Has the US ever considered adopting a method of running its accounts that isn't completely disfunctional?
NutralMcNutralGuy,We don’t negotiate with terrorists
That_Girl_Cray,You get nothing! You lose! Good day sir!
Bizarre_Protuberance,"Good.  The GOP has become accustomed to bullying people.  Someone needs to say ""enough""."
EthelMaePotterMertz,">What Republicans are doing is manufacturing a hostage crisis, effectively telling Democrats that the GOP is prepared to harm Americans on purpose unless their demands are met. For all intents and purposes, it is a Republican extortion scheme.

>If the new House majority wants to try to pass a bill through the American legislative process, pursuing cuts to public investments, it’s welcome to try to do so. But **declaring that they’ll crash the economy deliberately unless Democrats meet their demands is an indefensible tactic that cannot be tolerated.**

Damn right."
Flimsy-Lie-1471,Good.  We do not negotiate with terrorists.
TheRealTinfoil666,"So Trump and gang do huge tax breaks for the rich  

So this leads to bigger deficit and therefore rising national debt. 

NOW, the GQP wants to cut all of the ‘poor people programs’ because there is now too much debt. !??!??"
kenlasalle,That is the correct response.
Epistatious,"Ideally dems would say, ""Tell ya what we will work with you to reduce the deficit by getting rid of the 2017 tax cuts.  Since you are worried about financial responsibility""."
Murrumbeenian,"Is it that time of year already?

And why was this never a thing when Trump happily added trillions to the US debt?"
1Eternallylost,"So what do I get for not blowing up the bank?

nothing.  Not blowing up the bank is the standard.

But I could blow up the bank.

I suppose, but why would you blow up the bank?

Because I can get something out of not blowing it up.

That makes no sense.

It's how I feel.  It doesn't have to make sense.  I want to get something out of not blowing up the bank.

That's called extortion.

No, no.  Extortion is if I threaten you.  I'm not threatening anything.  I just want a reward for not blowing up the bank.

How about the feeling you get when you don't do horrible things?

You're not getting this."
therinwhitten,"If they take a government credit system hostage, does that mean the House is a domestic terrorist cell?"
kingdazy,Good. The debt ceiling threat is a gun that Dems know the GOP can't actually use.
seensham,I don't know what changed but I'm glad the Dems are finally pushing back properly.
AirIcy3918,Stay strong Dems.  Don’t give in to terrorists.
SamuraiJackBauer,"Good. Don’t normalize it. 

Treat them like the children they are."
_SpaceTimeContinuum,Republicans are a bunch of fucking terrorists who are going to hold the entire nation hostage in order to pass their incredibly unpopular and incredibly insane policies.  I fucking hate them so much.  Republicans are our enemies.
RDO_Desmond,This is about paying for what has already been spent. Why do republicans keep acting like it is new spending when they know darn well it is not?!
Alt-One-More,How come Republicans Representative seem to hate the US so much.
rafingo,Don't negotiate with terrorists
Mynameisinuse,So Republican's are threatning to not do their jobs and to screw over the American people again unless the Democrat's give them more power.  Seems about right.
Least_Paramedic6268,"republicans always lose the debt ceiling fight.  they money was appropriated by congress.  don’t like it?  fight against the spending, not the debt incurred by the spending"
yukoncowbear47,Yes.  Do this more and often.  Broadcast to the world that it's the GOP crashing everything and pound it into people's heads until they think they never thought otherwise.
stewartm0205,"If a hostage taker gets a reward, all he will do is take more hostages."
briendoesitallbad,"In some cases, ""we don't negotiate with terrorists"" needs to be true."
crankery,"This will be treated exactly the same way as the McCarthy speaker vote. The Dems will vote sensibly, all of the republicans will be obstructionists and try to grandstand all day long then blame the Democrats for not negotiating with them despite the fact that they hold a majority. 

And eventually after the dust settles Donald Trump will declare victory was delivered from his enormous brain. MTG and Boo-boo will Roshambo to decide who’s the heel and who’s the face for this round. Gaetz’s head will get even larger and stupider looking. Gym will fit 300 words into the space where 50 would comfortably fit while saying nothing whatsoever in relation to what the hell is going on."
DustBunnyZoo,"Weird how there wasn’t a single discussion about debt during the four years of Trump, but once a Democrat is elected it is suddenly an issue.  Strange.

[Republicans only care about debt when there’s a Democrat in the White House](https://www.newstatesman.com/business/economics/2018/02/republicans-only-care-about-debt-when-there-s-democrat-white-house)"

Chrisbap,"This is the way.  Tell the Republicans that you will vote for a clean debt ceiling increase.  If they want to add a bunch of stuff to it, they can do it without Democratic votes."
sugarlessdeathbear,Mint the trillion dollar coin and tell the GOP to pound sand. Take one of their big sticks away so they can't hit you with it.
Nwcray,"I propose that every dollar reduced has to be offset by a dollar in revenue. Start with the Trump tax cuts. Then do the Bush tax cuts. 

Conversely - the answer is no."
CouchHam,Lol this already? I hate republicans for this shit they play every time. They’ll do anything but be genuine or work toward good things for Americans.
Fulllyy,"That’s the proper answer: “NO”. 

At some point the Dems have to stop letting these dish throwers “negotiate over whether they’re going to throw dishes at the wall”.

Fuck that. If they want to wreck the place, make sure they suffer the consequences FIRST, ever and always."
bcrabill,I'm so sick of Republicans holding the country hostage.
4wordSOUL,"Jesus christ if the GOP ever get the White House, Senate and House again they will sell us down the river for a dollar. Hopefully the Trump Judiciary won't completely destroy global Democracy before they all leave office in 35 years."
KingDorkFTC,Dems better hold to this or 2024 is not going to look good.
theoldgreenwalrus,"*No ice cream for you, Jack*"

wastingvaluelesstime,this is the way
termsofengaygement,I like this energy. I hope they keep it up!
Internet_Jerk_,Someone finally called it what it is - extortion.
joshdoereddit,"""President Joe Biden, McCarthy said, should begin the process now of negotiating with GOP leaders and making them happy so as to avoid a default.""

Ah, so, fuck the American people. It's about making you guys happy. Weasel McCarthy and the GOP are such assholes.

I don't know if it's best done now or later, but Dems need to get cracking on messaging here. It needs to be made crystal clear that this is a manufactured crisis and any negative impact on our economy rests squarely on the GQP, and more importantly McCarthy's shoulders.

I'd love to see him lose the gavel in '24. Not only would that mean he lost, we'd also get to see Democrats choose a Speaker in one vote."
mark-haus,It’s good to finally see the democrats have a backbone. It’s been sorely needed for a long time now
Zebra971,"Simple answer to any republican extortion, we don’t negotiate with insurrectionists and terrorists."
Jazeraine-S,"Who even has time for these children? America has real crises (multiple) to deal with. From trans genocide, the resurgence of anti-semitism, the new surge of anti-Asian hatred, existing systemic racism and sexism, assaults on LBGTQ+ people as a whole, the mass shooting epidemic, the twin health care affordability and accessibility crises, the many problems private equity firms are continuing to cause, the impossible housing system, inflation, global warming, three airborne simultaneous pandemics, the continuing airline meltdown, domestic terrorists shooting up America’s power substations, disaster relief for wherever the crazy weather is today, the class warfare, and the red states that want to go back to leaded paint, asbestos insulation, and segregation.

Deal with REAL problems and stop wasting America’s time, you moochers. We need to defund professional obstructionists!"
SaintOlgasSunflowers,">What makes the debt ceiling qualitatively different is that this isn’t a policy dispute. What Republicans are doing is manufacturing a hostage crisis, effectively telling Democrats that the GOP is prepared to harm Americans on purpose unless their demands are met. For all intents and purposes, it is a Republican extortion scheme.

This sums it up nicely."
M142Man,Republicans aren't reading the room.
Key-Bell8173,Someone needs to tell McCarthy and the House Freedom Caucus that the United States government doesn’t negotiate with terrorists.
ShakesbeerMe,"Let them shut it down again- the polls always destroy the GOP when they pull this stunt. 

Stop negotiating with wholly-owned-by Russian terrorists."
DirectorMysterious64,I am hoping that the dems post everything that the gop request. Let their true self exude from their greedy little bodies! I would like to see how many more right offs the gop request for the rich. Shameless SOB's!!
EmotionalRedditMod,Politicians making 6 figures once again doing the bare minimum funding the gov. before the deadline.  Amazing how these clowns get paid so much money for doing literally fuck all to benefit ordinary working people.
Maleficent-Blood8070,What's ironic is the red states have high numbers of people on food stamps and struggling. Yet they vote Republican.  Could it be because they still marry cousins in some of those Southern states.
Wolverine-75009,It appears some people are confused about some basic concepts. Debt ceiling consists of money already spent and owed. https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/deficits-debt-and-interest
DMDaddi-oh,Isn't it American policy not to negotiate with terrorists?
BNLboy,Guess the GOP can start putting up the facade of financial responsibility now that Trump isn't the one digging the hole anymore.

Nenor,"""We have to tell them there is no table."" 
Democrats finally found their balls."
Snarfbuckle,About fucking time the Democratic party plays hardball with the GOP. The GOP simply cannot be trusted to work for Americans.
Matrix17,"Good. Call their bluff. Let it be known that the GOP are at fault for crashing the economy

Keep in mind, crashing the economy would have a significant impact on all the shady investments GOP members have, and also the corporations they answer to. They have a lot more to lose than they'd ever let on"
Illustrious-Night-99,Notice that in the past 15 years that the only time the government is at risk of shutdown or default is when the Republicans are in charge of the House.  What does that tell you? 🤔
metal0060,"Republicans put themselves in a lose/lose here. Let the country default, they look like the assholes, and lose votes in the next election. Don’t let the country default and they alienate the MAGA morons who really have no clue what a default does. 

Either way they blink and extend the ceiling."
Wine_Women_Song,Well done!  Negotiations must be in good faith. There is nothing to negotiate here.
Alternative-Flan2869,Everything is seen as an opportunity for a scam and a grift with this gqp cult.
Nomad47,Lol that should be our new national policy with the republican party no cookies for domestic terrorists and insurrectionist so tired of their bs.
Brilliant_Grape87,Im pretty sure that’s the intention of Republicans so they can fool their supporters that it’s the Biden’s administration fault they are in this position.
lookatthemonkeys,This isn't even about spending. It's about paying the bills for the spending that was already agreed to!
KevinCarbonara,I'm so glad to be past the age of Pelosi. I don't miss the days of Democrats loudly promising compromise as soon as they take office
XpertDestroyer,We don’t deal with terrorists foreign or domestic.

CankerLord,"If they wanted to save money and stop deficit spending they should have done it when they had control of congress. Instead they cut taxes, which is the exact opposite.

Evening_Chemist_2367,Good.
Flimsy-Attention-722,"Just an FYI, contrary to what some think, raising the debt ceiling had nothing to do with adding to the debt. It is to pay for prior obligations.
""Default on financial obligations

If the debt ceiling is not raised and extraordinary measures are exhausted, the U.S. government is legally unable to borrow money to pay its financial obligations. At that point, it must cease making payments unless the treasury has cash on hand to cover them.""
And most of the debt is held by us.
""Some 70% of the national debt is owned by domestic government, institutions investors and the Federal Reserve. A shade under 30% is owned by foreign entities, according to the latest information from the U.S. Treasury."""

JoeBuckstrap,"There was never doubt that the Repugnants would get the poltroon McCarthy in as Speaker before Jan 13th.  Otherwise, they would not be paid.  They don't care what damage they do - especially to Social Security and Medicare, because it doesn't fit into their agenda: taxcuts and handouts for billionaires, megamillionaires and polluters paid for by working people - as long as they get a paycheck (and donor kickbacks)."
