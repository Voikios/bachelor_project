nanotree,"Um, Kerbal Space Program 2?

It's going to be in early access but still excited for what it could become"
bayssa,Is Diablo 4 not a thing or what?
Specialist_Rush_6634,"2023 is going to be a LEGENDARY year in game development if all the games with 2023 release dates don't get delayed to 2024. Legitimately, this is going to rival some of the all time great years of game releases.

ESPECIALLY if Starfield turns out to be Bethesda's return to making cutting edge, industry leading RPG's. For me it has the most potential in both directions. It could blow my expectations out of the water or leave me bitterly disappointed."
balwick,"I know I'm going to put 1000's of hours into Starfield. I have about 5000 between Fallout 4 and Skyrim.

I had some concerns about Starfield, but they've really fallen away as I get more excited, and more details have been revealed. 

E.g.; There are lots of planets, and they were initially procedurally generated, but Artists are working away at polishing them. Also, the Random Encounter system has seen such an improvement that entire structures/dungeons etc. can be spawned, rather than just NPCs as in the days of yore.

Character creation and skill levelling combines the best elements from the catalogue of Bethesda RPG titles; You choose a background which affects starting perks and traits, you can choose extra traits in character creation, skills level through use to unlock new perks. There's also \*unconfirmed\* rumours that your start will have options ala Alternate Start, or I guess Cyberpunk 2077.

Hypedump over.

Also Armored Core making a return? Inject it into my veins pls."

hails8n,"SILK SONG!!!





ðŸ¤¡"
dugthefreshest,"Good ol BOTW.

Hopefully the Master Sword doesn't need to recharge for 10 real time minutes in this game.

Hopefully weapons, including boss rewards, don't break after 2-3 fights without a option to repair.

I hope the game has a narrative, and not just walking around completing the shrines.

I hope the ""combat challenges"" aren't the same single enemy over and over and over again."
TimOrbitalStar,can't wait to buy skyrim for my smartwatch

Negrodamuswuzhere,"One of my biggest pet peeves about this sub is when people post pictures without labelling things. Like wtf is that? Ok I can see that it's spiderman2, some game with link and then a spaceship in the desert. It really is frustrating to have to come to the comments to see what games are involved, it feels like people are supposed to know every single game all the time."
