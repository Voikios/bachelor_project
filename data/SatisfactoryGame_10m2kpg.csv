TankerSider,"So, I'm not scared of spiders or anything similar to them. But the way these guys chase me, the sounds they make, the fact that they can chase me all the way back to my base makes me always turn on arachnophobia mode in a new session. It's not like they would be scary in a game like Outlast but since this is Satisfactory and it is a chill game I have a different mindset so in this case, they do scare me very much..."
OmegaSevenX,Nooooooope!

Ult1mateN00B,Only reason I play dyson sphere program instead of satisfactory is these things and no slapping a cat.jpg on top of it does not make it less repulsive.
