FearTheOldBlood1,"Only 20 Jiggies? You gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers."
Cannonhammer93,"Not many games that I 100%, but Banjo Kazooie is just too perfect."
Frank_Trespass,"Go to Freezeezy peak, NOW!"
Zaknokimi,A self-tip I learnt as a kid was to go right down to the fans in Rusty Bucket Bay to get the notes so that I don't die from falling off later.
SendMe_SmallBoobs,I can hear this picture
ranger_dood,"Go to work for a public school district. The pay isn't the greatest, but for a few months out of the year there's a chance of snow days again!

Source: grown-ass adult currently enjoying the second snow day of the week."
Koops8,Masterpiece
Bananna_Hamock0,"This game is meant for kids and I have no fucking clue how a child is supposed to beat the game in its entirety. Fighting the witch at the end is just confusing af.

Yes. Skill issue."
ChaosSigil,"Holy shit!!! Thank you for representing one of the best games of all time! 

Banjo Kazooie was my favorite game in my early days. But just the first one. I never got around to playing the sequels. 

They are also my favorite (and main) character(s) in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. 

I don't see a lot of love for this game, so thank you. If I ever have kids, this will be among the first games they will ever play."
defusted,A part of me envies you
Crazy_Canuck78,Oh man.... the jolly / cozy vibes are off the charts with this.

It never stops, but it sure as heck slows down"

Your last five notes are either in one of the huts on stilts or by the pink egg."
ArbitraryChaos13,Every day is a snow day if you don't work remotely.
DoesLogicHurtYou,Where are the dorittos and coke?  If your game controller isn't a grease fire hazard you're not properly reliving your youth.
Nyderthe1stEmperor,This is just beautiful
EroticEmpress,THAT IS MY FAVORITE N64 GAME!!
Feisty-Location-5708,Banjo Kazooie is probably my all time favorite game

Lucky you!"

westbee,"College professor checking in. 

God damn I loved snow days like these when they close the whole campus. It's like a free paid day for me. 

One year it was so bad, we missed three classes (every Wednesday 6-9:40 pm).  It was awesome. 

""Okay. No homework, see you next week!"" 

Never even left my house."
Crayshack,It doesn't have to be your last snow day ever.  Get a job in education and keep getting snow days for the rest of your life (or until global warming cooks the planet).

billclintonsbunghole,Lucky! The college I teach at switches to virtual classrooms when classes are cancelled for snow. 🥲

BrutusGregori,"I got snow days in the United States Air Force.

Best days ever. Pizza, day beers and playing video games."
Slow-Neighborhood-51,I'm sorry for mine don't have this game
busychild424,"I went back to college to finish my degree when I was 34 years old. Was a single parent of a kindergartner. There was nothing I loved more than hearing that he had a snow day, and then that I had one. I could stay up late playing Halo and sleep late in the morning and take him sledding. Some really great days."
joscun86,No price is right? That was my snow/sick day wake up show
TupacsGh0st,I'm replaying this with my older brother right now. I'm 32 and having a blast all over again. Solid 3d platformer all these years later
TheLuiginator,***Guh-huh!***
Tuiror,Bubblegloop Swamp is when I realized a love for video game soundtracks... I don't love that level itself though; a certain crocodile saw to that.
stolid_agnostic,Work for a university. You’ll get them again.
n00bz,It's probably one of the last snow days for everyone.  Now a lot of the schools have switched to virtual learning days instead of snow days.
RETARD_STOMPER,HAHAHA NOSTALGIA POST EVERYBOSY UPVOTESWEEEE
Uik44,Still in college at 31? What are you studying?

tidytibs,Hell yeah! Git sum!
lockdots,I wish I could Heart react this post.
ScruffMixHaha,"On the first snow day I remember I was playing Mario Party 1 by myself for some reason...

Not sure why, but Im sure I had a blast"
Wasabicannon,Fuck that. If the roads are in a bad condition you call out of work. Don't risk your life for a job that will not give 2 shits if you die.
craigwhyte,GAH GAH GUH GUH GA GUH GUH GAH
Vladomirtheinhaler,I spent my snow days riding my dune buggie in the yard and sliding everywhere doing donuts. My dad loved it cause I destroyed all the grass he worked so hard to grow and maintain lol. Kids are bastards.
rmprice222,"I dunno man depends on where you're at, my work is planning a snow day tomorrow because of weather."

blue_effect,I loved this game but it has so many currencies/things to collect. 😆

jeremyweiss5,You're gonna remember this day when you get older. Fondest of memories.
slipmagt,What time does Jerry Springer come on?
TPrice1616,"Love it. Reminds me of my junior year in college when we had a lot of snow. A friend brought his N64 to our hangout, pulled out Conkers Bad Fur Day, and said “let’s kill some brain cells boys.” Good times."
Dirtytarget,I took this as OP was never going to see snow again because they were dying 💀

makemeking706,"Congrats on the electricity, too."
OldSerialNo,"I don't want to ruin the magic of your day, but depending on your job you may still have snow days in your future."
CoitusCaptain,Yuh-huh
SeanConneryShlapsh,If you really wanted to do it up like you did back in elementary school. You’d of gone back to your parents house and sat Indian style in front of the television.
FIAFormula,"I work for a construction company, thought I was going to have a quiet day at home. I had 48 phone calls today and worked 10 hours. A normal day is closer to 100 calls and 12 hours, so I guess it was an improvement. Enjoy college while you still can. It's all an up hill climb to the cemetery after that (for me at least)."
thebachelorbowl,This is the best game. Hands down.
ButTheMeow,All days are snow days when you're unemployed.
ikedag808,"Just move somewhere like Portland or Seattle where we don't get much snow so our infrastructure isn't set up for it but it can dump snow or ice for a few days in the winter and then a lot of businesses close and the city kinda shuts down.  I had an ice day this past December, it was awesome especially being a salary worker."
kahunamoe,I got to call into work cause my kids home for a snow day! We play shredders revenge
JohnBarleyCorn2,I have dreams about being back in school as an adult and going to class. Its strange.
HalfSoul30,"Man, i have both games, but can't play them right now because my n64 randomly resets after about 10 minutes to the intro song. Probably and easy fix or cheaply replaceable, but i'm lazy."
Thebodytalk,Is that on switch?!
BirdjaminFranklin,"Maybe the last snow storm, but depending on where you live, you could potentially enjoy future flood, hurricane, forest fire, tornado, riot days.

The collapse of global climate and capitalism might have it's perks :P"

musicman835,I’ve had snow days working for the county where I lived. It’s possible.
ktdotnova,Damn... should I... or should I not buy a gaming system lol? YOLO I guess...
alsatian01,I graduated college at 31. The thing that sux the most is seeing guys the same age as I am that are already set up with a retirement strategy that has them all set by their late 50s. The other downside is being on the wrong side of 45 with youngish children. I don't get to stay home when it snows but we don't work in the snow or the rain. I get paid $50 an hour to watch shows on streamers and scroll Reddit for the day.
colindean,"I thought the same the last time I had a snow day in college. Then, a few years later, I was working as a subcontractor for a government agency when there was a really awful snow storm in DC. I was on site already, chilling at my hotel the night before when I got a message from my contact at the department that the federal government was going to be closed the next day because of the anticipated weather. I asked what I should do and my contact advised me to take a day off because if I showed up there would be nobody there to let me in. Snow day, in a hotel, by myself, in DC. I think I just slept and I think I installed Starcraft on my work laptop."
notable4,Enjoy that
reed17purdue,"Upset they didn't remake this. The Spyro trilogy remake was great, my son is learning it now."
TheSpacedGhost,I live vicariously through you
gingeracha,"So wild, I just replayed it a few days ago. It really is a perfect game. Great music and effects, humor, and gorgeous worlds that feel big but aren't big enough to get lost in."
JamieAstraRain,Dugaloo what are you doing. Go back to bed and pretend you have a fever before Leah finds you. Then after you can get sympathy card.
epi_glowworm,Fuck ya
ElDuderino_92,Probably one of the best soundtracks in a game ever.
Inxed,I couldn't be more proud of you
Bostonterrierpug,"Protip: become a teacher or professor. you still get snow days. 

Actually, don’t try to become a professor cause tenure jobs are really hard to come by. More so  don’t get a job in Florida cause we get zero snow days."
clovers2345,God I love that game!
Diddler_kid,"I've been balling for 4 hours, cherish it!"

smacgillivray,Wait till you have kids. You get their snow days too if you're crafty
bunnyman14,"Campus closed at 3pm here! Unfortunately, that means the schedule is screwed up."
oWallis,Would be Runescape all day for me. Nothing was better than waking up to no school and hopping on with the boys to chop willows in Draynor all day.
SayerofNothing,"You're sitting too close to the TV, you'll go blind like that."
MetroidAddict64,Toronto brother over here?
LunaLynnTheCellist,"Never had a snow day, but they seem AMAZING"

hanzandfranz,Gotta watch The Price is Right.
Tim_Allosaurus,I worked from home and my office closed for snow. I assure you there will be possible snow days in the working world.
NW7l2335,Why do you think the age of 31 will be your last snow day? What if it snows so much you can’t go anywhere?
Kelevracado4287,"Well, depending on what field you get into you might get another snow day. Is this Kazooie or Tooie?"

Thin-Performance-637,Hahah best feeling to play after work or on a windy or snowy day
Idivkemqoxurceke,"White collar corporate jobs have snow days, just sayin."
beepboopbeeepboop0,I’m 39 and spent the day playing nhl 94 on snes. Lol
cabbagesforsale,"Yeah once you start work, there's this thing called remote work now. Nullifies the ""I can't get to the office to work"" argument."
Intensional,"I lived in the DC area for 5 years and got two snow weeks (!?!) when I was working for the federal government. This was way before Covid so they may have figured out how to actually do remote work right so this may not be a thing anymore, but it was nice since my kids were little and we got to play in the snow all day on a random Tuesday."
Ok-Internet-1740,"Nah you get snow days for work. Just say there's 8 inches coming down today and you aren't driving it. Easy, done."
munchiemike,Gotta pause for some price is right around lunchtime.

neuromorph,Last until you have kids
harlojones,"I work at a college and we usually get two snow days a year, I absolutely spend them like this"
Oberyn_TheRed_Viper,No such thing as snow days here. We got hot days. Where if it was over 40*C 3 days in a row we could stay home in the AC if you were fortunate enough to have it.
HELPMEIMBOODLING,"Shit I didn't even think of it like that, and instead used the snow day to go in to the college to do work on my 1 day off. Ah well, I'll just say it's practice for adult life."
TheWholeFuckinShow,"Favourite N64 game of all time.

Banjo Kazooie needs a proper 3rd installment, or at least a proper HD remaster. The Xbox live arcade version was not what was needed."

irjapdhbotszqaxute,"Upvote for Banjo Kazooie, nothing wrong with emulating via switch (which is what I think you're doing?), but I'd recommend the X360 version. It's a major improvement rendering at 1080p natively"
UncleBenji,"Awww yeaahhhh

I still remember that strange out of place picture in the tree house that had a bit of up skirt."
Aphi-,Do y’all’s jobs not call off for snow? Plenty of snow days ahead :)
lazychef822,Back in my day we watched the price is right.

ColeProtoco1,"Man, N64 had so many great games. BK, Goldeneye, LoZ OoT, SW Shadows of the Empire, SW Rogue Squadron, SW Ep I Podracer, Super Smash Bros, Super Mario 64. Miss those days."
Voittaa,"I literally just started playing this on Switch *today*. Nice to have the wireless 64 controller to boot. 

When we were kids, my cousin deleted my save when I was on Gruntilda and I never forgave him, nor did I finish the game. Doing younger me a solid and 100%ing this bitch."
Mr_Careworn,My local army base has snow days.  We're in north Alabama so our 2 snow plows ain't solving anything

olov244,"as a kid when it snowed, I'd make a snowball and put it in the freezer, then I'd throw it on my birthday(not at a person, my dad would have whooped me)"

I live in Chicago and there was a truly [epic blizzard in 2011](https://abc7chicago.com/chicago-blizzard-2011-snowmageddon-biggest-snowstorms-winter-storm/10139546/) and it was a snow-day for pretty much the whole city the next day."

*megamind face*"
jcamp088,"Thank you for posting this.

Clock_Management,No price is right?
