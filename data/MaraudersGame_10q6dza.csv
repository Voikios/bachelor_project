SkyWizarding,"I don't know why you'd spend your time waiting around the gate to MAYBE get gear off a player when you can just, ya know, raid one of the levels. I guess you could be trying to get marauder kills but that doesn't seem efficient either. I don't even bother with space battles unless someone else starts up with me"
Durash,Theyâ€™re statpadding marauder kills. The game bugs and counts pod kills as two marauder kills. They couldâ€™ve also joined late or just left one of the raids aswell.
FrodoTheDodo,The Rat code is against killing in vain like that
XivTillIDie,"Sorry mate, but space is a dangerous placeâ€¦ especially with me n the boys taking the capital ship out with 2 missile turrets."
Tuffarms,It's the Spussy bro
thearks,I do this when I get the kill 1 marauder contract. It's an easy kill-- much easier than doing it in the raid.
SenorPancake,"I've done this before with a friend. The goal was ambush someone on the way out, and have him board just in time to shoot them while they were getting in the pod. When we weren't successful, I shot down the pod.

It's fun to be a pirate and it's fun to kill people. All the more reason you need to remember the game isn't over until you are out the gate. Players expect to be able to beeline it direct to the gate with no conflict after leaving a map."
some_random_nonsense,I will admit to boosting my marauders kills a bit by blasting pods. Its helpful to quickly farm kills when you need them for ZtH or skins.
___Dan___,"Iâ€™d guess itâ€™s most likely a 40 year old virgin whoâ€™s trying to farm player kills. Itâ€™s happened to me and I found it infuriating. Iâ€™ve also been breached immediately after exiting the raid area in my ship. It was a TTV player, fully geared to who ran straight to the cockpit and murdered me. Extremely frustrating"

SilentDragaur,Could have also been an NPC ship.
No_Click_1748,That may have been me to be honest. ðŸ˜‚
CreativityAtLast,"Iâ€™ve been the reverse, where I was the scout frigate with rockets coming out of a POI. When I see another rust bucket I shoot. When I see the pod come out and try to leave I also shoot. If I hit I hit, if he gets out I probably made the raid needlessly less stressful for him. This is how I make my fun in todays world. I am sorry if I have blown up your loot, I was probably too full to care about collecting it anyway."
McTuffyv2,Iâ€™ve seen one dude who just flies around in the scout ship and the rocket arty which is probably exactly what killed you and thatâ€™s all those losers do. Sit at the extraction and shoot their 40 missiles at people
HelmutIV,They probably had the raid or zero to hero quest till kill marauders and you were an ez clap.
TheRealGenki,Ppl have time to do shit like this? gawd damn dude I'm sorry u had to go thru that
Michaelscot8,"I don't like killing pods, especially on exfil, but understood rules are, if you get disabled and don't breach, you die. It desentivises running away, that's the point. If I disable you and you try to breach I won't kill you, if I disable you and you run, you better be damn good at it."
