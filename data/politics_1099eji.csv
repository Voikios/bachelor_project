TintedApostle,"Its all fine.  The GOP is going to have a ""Sit down"" with Santos.  That should fix it.

LMAO"
kandoras,"Nassau GOP: ""You should resign.""

Santos: ""No.""

Nassau GOP: ""Welp, we did all we can do.  Guess we'll have to live with him, and so will all the rest of you.""

>I was elected to serve the people of #NY03 not the party & politicians

No, Jewish guy descended from Holocaust survivors, whose mother died on 9/11, with a college degree, with a job history, who was gay, and who supported gay rights - that guy was elected.

You ain't him."
ColonelBonk,He won’t “resign” instead he’ll “re-sign” ….
allaboutthismoment,"This is so fucking funny! George Santos is bad but Trump, Boebert, Gaetz, Greene...they're all truth-telling, good citizens and deserve their positions in government? May they *all* drown in the toilet they've created."
MydniteSon,"He'll resign...next week...yeah, that's the ticket! He just has to consult his wife...Morgan Fairchild!"
connjose,"The amount of disrespect Americans have for thier politicians is staggering. That man took two bullets to the chest on Omaha beach, it's a testament to his strength of character that NASA accepted him on  the astronaut training program."
BlotchComics,"The GOP has been enabling blatant liars for so long that they created this guy as the new prototypical republican.

And now some of them want to look like they're doing the right thing, but it's way too late for that."
gnomebludgeon,"Rep George Santos - ""Screw y'all, I got mine""."
GrouchoManSavage,"Santos: ""Nyet."""
petgreg,Santos: I've already resigned.
RicksterA2,"This should be pretty straight forward:  is he legally a US Citizen and meets the House Representative requirements?

I'll bet he doesn't meet either."
Mythosaurus,">	“Obviously, he’s addressed some of the concerns that we’ve had. In New York, they’re having a lot of internal conversations too. But at the end of the day, you know, he was seated, nobody objected to him being seated,” House Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told CNBC on Wednesday morning after being asked whether Santos will serve his full two-year term.

That’s what happens when pure power is all that matters. Santos emulates Trump in abandoning norms and morals to seize rulership, and has no legal reason to give up that authority.

The correct response is to create a legal process where the House can work with a state to strip a representative of their position via a transparent and good faith process. 

The trick is making that process as immune to partisan abuse as possible, and allows voter representation for picking a replacement."
hifumiyo1,And he’s gleefully witnessing the ethics committee be hamstrung
evanvivevanviveiros,"A Republican?

Resign?

For something they did?

Hahahah"
mvanigan,">Top Republicans in Nassau County, New York, called on GOP Rep. George Santos to immediately resign Wednesday for fabricating major details of his resume.

>“He’s disgraced the House of Representatives and we do not consider him one of our congresspeople,” Nassau County Republican Party Chairman Joseph Cairo said of Santos at a press conference."
theClumsy1,">Santos has apologized to anyone “disappointed by resume embellishments,” but he vehemently denies committing any crimes.

That's part of the fucking problem. There is no law against lying on your resume, so lying to win is a low cost risk."
Trance354,"> I was elected to serve the people of #NY03 

The *fuck* you were!  A Jewish businessman with a successful business acumen and a stunning education was elected.  This businessman was beset by tragedy when his mother died in the attack on NY, 9-11-01.  His family had earlier grief when they had to flee Europe ahead of the Nazi menace.  From Ukraine.

Wait.  Jews didn't flee the USSR until the Purge started, or just before if they could read the writing on the wall.

There's something wrong with this fictional person I've created in my mind! And I'm fine with that because he's still infinitely better of a human being than the lying sack of purple potatoes that is George Santos.

/the purple potatoes are from Peru, yes, I know."
CreepyWhistle,"""*Did he vote for McCarthy and the rules yet? Yes? Okay now we can tell him to resign*"""
Balogne,Former King of England George Santos will get right on resigning.
abraksis747,Doesn't McCarthy lose his majority if he leaves?
ThickerSalmon14,"They called on him to resign.  He said no.  The GOP leadership concerned about their small majority have said that they will take no action.

So, the Democrats need to hang George around the neck of every republican politician."
Wand_Cloak_Stone,"As a Nassau County resident, I’m kind of surprised Republican officials here even give enough of a crap to play theater like this. But maybe I shouldn’t be, as after all, his district *was* a D+2 district in the last election, and people here of all political affiliations are pissed as hell.

Disregarding political theater though, I wrote this comment on another thread about protests organized by many of the same people who voted for him, and I think it deserves repeating here because there’s been a lot of misrepresentation about the real, non-politician people in his district going on:

>There are a bunch of protests planned in his district. A lot of people voted for him based off of factors he lied about, therefore they feel as if they voted for a different candidate altogether since it was all based off of false pretenses.

>A major factor of that is that there is a very sizable Jewish community on Long Island, including in his district. A lot of them are hearing people like Kanye, like the khaki pants paraders, like the people trying to blow up synagogues in Jersey, etc., and are afraid. The increase in antisemitism in this country is palpable. And so when a candidate tells them they also had ancestors who died in the holocaust and so on, they feel like they are voting in someone who sees them and will help protect them.

>But Santos lied about that. And he’s clearly a Proud Boy supporter to boot. He’s the exact opposite of what they wanted when they voted for him. And almost nobody on Long Island has heard of or reads the “North Shore Leader,” which is the only publication that published his opponent’s opposition research. The New York Times denied a request to publish it prior to the election.  **[Edit: And let’s please dispel the accusation that his opponent didn’t do any opposition research. He did, and he brought it to several publications including the New York Times. Nobody would publish it. He decided not to use it in his own campaign messages because, without anyone backing him up, it would make *him* look like the liar launching a smear campaign against a supposedly Jewish gay man. But the New York Times, who said they don’t cover local stories when they declined, sure seem to love covering this topic now that it’s great clickbait for them.]**

>My point is that his constituents are out there making an effort. I live in the district directly south of Santos’s, and I wrote to my own rep (also Republican) asking him to denounce Santos and his lies, his criminal history, and his behavior since being elected. I did not vote for him, but at least I can say my rep was an NYPD detective, so he has actually personally been affected by 9/11 **[Edit: Referring to Santos’s false claim that 9/11 took his mother’s life]**, or at least knows a lot of people who were. I imagine he’s not too impressed by Santos, and the people of Nassau County deserve to hear that he is against antisemitism, white supremacy, and the rest of Santos’s bullshit."
p001b0y,"“Who?”

  —George Santos (or whomever he is)"
treebarkcharlie,Full disclosure I'm a registered Democrat on Long Island. That said there's no chance in hell this dude resigns. He's a fucking psychopath who is eating this shit up
Skatchbro,Remember when Al Franken resigned because he was in an inappropriate picture? I certainly do.
KTRyan30,What if he just promises never to do it again?
Niftyone578,"GOP pretending they were ""caught off guard"" by Santos lies.  Yet they love and embrace Trump's lies.  The definition of a Republican is that of being a liar.  The Republican Party is saying they will not use Santos to help constituents with problems, they will instead contact their Senators.  So they know that Santos will remain in his US House position for his entire term.  They embrace their grifters."
Creepy_Helicopter223,I like how they waited for after he voted for McCarthy to go for this
pottman,"That was fast, I wonder what he did for them turn on him so fast. It can't be lies. They're used to that."
,"Sorry but you have to have shame and character for this.  When someone tells you who they are believe them.  Some newspaper/reporter lost out on a Pulitzer for local reporting, too bad for us and them."
LazeLinez,"Lol, can we stop pretending that calls to resign mean anything? Our government is a shitty stage act at this point."
kilobitch,"Honestly I thought that given the tight R control of the House, they’d let him sit and just shut him out of any committee assignments, in order to keep the seat. But it really does look like momentum is building to expel him band his district leans D, so there’s a good change to make the R majority even slimmer."
nenulenu,This is all just for show. They know he is not resigning. They love grifters like this guy. Republican party is full of them.
,"GOP knew he lied. There was a report as early as September 2022 saying he lied about it all. GOP decided It was better to play along because by that time they would have forfeited the election. 
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/show/small-local-paper-uncovered-and-reported-george-santos-scandal-before-november-election"
unique_passive,Maybe they should impeach him if they think he’s unsuitable for office. They could get the supermajority needed to have him permanently barred from holding office too. Unless the GOP cares more about holding power than about giving power to people who shouldn’t have it
swipichone,Someone needs to start a recall petition
Vladimer_Trump,I don't see why he should resign - he is the epitome of the party - a sneak a liar a cheat and a crook - just par for the course.
2_dam_hi,"Don't fall for the belief that they're doing it out of any sense of decency or patriotism. They need to replace him with someone safer, or they'll lose the seat in two years."
clunkenmcculkin,Hang on. I thought this was straight out the Republican playbook. From what I've seen this is just another day in Republican land. This bullshitting prick is just like all the others. Surely if ge goes they all go.
Shanknuts,From Super Bowl winning QB to this. What a year it’s been for George Santos.
mik33tion,"Next, any Rep who helped promote the big lie should also resign."
_SpaceTimeContinuum,By that standard every Republican should resign because they're all a bunch of fucking liars.
1mJustALurk3r,"Next up, he will be subpoenaed in a demand to get to the bottom of these lies.

He will ignore it.

Nothing will happen."
Ivorcomment,No way Santos will resign - he is just another turd perfectly at home amongst the excrement he is associated with.
althill,"Good on the Nassau GOP for doing the right thing and not circling the wagons. If only the GOP could have done this in 2016, we might have all been spared."
FUMFVR,"Unless they give him something for it, he's not going to resign. The guy is a career con man and pathological liar. There is no internal mechanism in his consciousness that will tell him that he needs to do what it right."
DDancy,"Campaign lies! 

He’s lied about every single aspect of his life. 

Who the fuck even is this guy? 

He’s lied about his parents and his childhood all the way up to schooling and educational qualifications and then his professional life and experience. 

He’s a plant. He’s been put in a position of power with millions of dollars at his disposal. If he isn’t a spy then what is he? 

He looks gormless and lime a complete idiot, but there’s a reason he has a lot of money and influence and has somehow made his way into a position of political power. 

The Manchurian Candidate springs to mind. It’s a bit sad that recognising such an obvious traitor in the midst is so difficult these days when they’re blinding everyone by throwing money everywhere."
RoninDelta1970,"The GOP continues to embarrass itself, the “press” continues to be virtually non existent when it comes to investigative reporting and vetting candidates. He should have never been sworn into office but the repubs wanted his vote for the speakership."
PartyWithSlurmz,"They don't care that he lied, they care that he got caught.

As if the GOP doesn't have the resources to check up this BS. They are not victims, they are a party to it."
DemiMini,He's just a small part of the freak show. he is completely representative of the values of Conservative Americans. He's pretty much a model citizen in that regard.
CountrySax,"But of course McCarthy supports this fraud just like he supports Traitor Trump 
Having Republicons in charge of the House is equivalent to an arsonist running the fire department"
Trix_Are_4_90Kids,Santos made a straight fool out of Nassau County GOP.
imsowhiteandnerdy,"Remember a time when disgraced politicians would resign when they had a scandal?

Pepperidge Farms, etc..."
Kamp_stardust,"[He's a ""usefully idiot"" financed by Russia, injecting chaos into an already tumultuous situation.](https://demcastusa.com/2022/12/30/follow-the-rubles-behind-george-santos/)"
TPconnoisseur,That any American is fine with this guy is bad.
beuhring,Since when did the GOP care about lies?
mazzicc,"Why would he ever do that? What about his history would make anyone think he would make a moral or ethical choice?

Oh right, they know he won’t, but this allows them to say “we totally told him to resign, it’s not our fault he didn’t and we continued to benefit from his representation of our fascist ideals”"
Lhamo55,"If he’s not the person he claimed to be, and it seems he lied and misrepresented so many different aspects of life, then he needs to be treated as an imposter and unseated while his real identity, intent, and sources of financial support are thoroughly investigated. This person should not have been sworn in when it’s clear we have no idea who he actually is. People voted for a figment of his imagination, an fictional character,  and now those voters and the rest of the nation all deserve to know his true identity and what has motivated him to create this persona. Is this a manifestation of uncontrolled mental illness  or is he an embarrassedly sloppily managed asset of a nefarious entity?"
ThePicassoGiraffe,And what’s that group gonna do when he follows the party example and says “LOL no”??
RDO_Desmond,He certainly defrauded those who voted for him as none of his representations were true.
SLS-Dagger,"Its has been beyond hilarious to watch the ""drain the swamp"" crew hanging out with this guy as pals."
Js_On_My_Yeet,I hope he says no. Let the GOP implode on its own and experience the results of their hateful rhetoric.
not-a_fed,"It's fun to see the GOP implode.  That will be trumps legacy, the destruction of the GOP."
Infidel8,"It's all for show. 

Local GOP officials make public statements, secure in the knowledge that (a) Santos won't step down and (b) McCarthy doesn't care.

These are nothing more than PR moves... Ethical Republicans have gone extinct like woolly mammoths."
Hogwarts_Earth2,How long g before GOP assures us that he learned his lesson.
Not-a-Kitten,Suzanne Collins is disappointed.
12358,George Santos and his defenders say that he should serve his term in office because the voters of his district elected him. The truth is that they voted for a fabricated person; they did not intend their vote to go to a compulsive liar. So he should resign.
mbelf,"I know he's a liar, by why would the GOP care about that? Is it a homophobic thing?"
irascible_Clown,What gets me is all these people were ok with Trumps lies.
6ory299e8,Spoiler alert:  he wont.
philosofossil13,"Why is there not an immediate and legitimate process for removing people like this? If you lie on a job resume to the point where you didn’t disclose fraudulent activities and literal countries investigations, you would be fired immediately and without hesitation and most likely turned over to the authorities"
ragingclaw,">Calling GOP Rep. George Santos a joke, a disgrace, abnormal and a pathological liar, local Republican officials in New York state on Wednesday said the newly elected congressman needed to immediately resign, accusing him of running a campaign of “deceit and lies.”

... Checks notes... So, a normal GOP campaign. Gotcha."
taxbeotch,How the actual fuck did none of this come out during the campaign??
JesusWuta40oz,Psst he won't.
sonoma4life,i'm laughing because i just remembered Kate Hill resigned for a workplace ethics violation between two adults but this guy will stick around.
OccultWitchHunt,Yes there should be a new election. And this should set the precedent for background checks in future elections.
PM_Me_Your_Sidepods,Charge him with fraud.
ConsciousLiterature,"They can't do anything about it, he will stay put.

They might vote him out in the next election but who knows with the short attention span."
IPInYourNetwork,Resign? He’ll probably get re-elected. SMH.
fuzzytradr,This human garbage needs to resign. What an absolute disgrace. GOP leadership is morally bankrupt for allowing him to stay.
Negative_Gravitas,"Meaningless, performative nonsense."
doublehaulrollcast,He won't because he's a pussy.
Character_Heart_9196,Liars lie .
RLoge85,So there are standards after all.... Where the fuck was this years ago
surfinwhileworkin,"I have a feeling something huge is about to come out about the four-time Super Bowl MVP George Santos. It takes a lot for the GOP to turn on one of their own, even a decorated war hero with multiple Medals of Honor."
Goldenboy451,An underrated reason to hate on Santos is how unbelievably lame he appears to be.
wolfinpdx77,My money is on the head of lettuce.
bozeke,“Nah” ~George Santos
GKM72,The only way he can get a guaranteed job for two years. A real employer would’ve terminated him.
FreakyPickles,"Call me crazy, but t think the fact that he said he's not going to resign means he definitely will."
the-becky,What if he doesn't resign? What are they going to do about it?
JeannetteHardnett,Am I wrong in thinking this would be a perfect class action lawsuit? I mean he completely misrepresented himself.
YamInternational_Yam,"Wow, just in time! Great job screening your candidates."
TUGrad,To bad the GOP members of the House haven't come to the same conclusion.
8Jennyx,Didn’t he take out Bin Laden?
Itchybootyholes,"Cool cool cool, so we can all ‘embellish’ our resumes now and still keep an elected seat.

DJBreadwinner,"Who do they think he is, Al Franken? He doesn't have enough shame to resign."
meeplewirp,"Why should he resign in context to the rest of the GOP? It’s literally the party of celebrating revenge porn and being anti abortion rights, they NO right to ask him to resign. Absolutely none"
jelloshooter1027,They might want to reinstate the ethics committee
bitwarrior80,"Well, maybe the voter's in this swing district will consider who they are really voting for the next time they see an (R) next to the name?"
go_comatose_for_me,They voted for (R) and they got an (R). I don't know what the GOP officials' problem is.
My_Favourite_Pen,"Every time I see photos of him, his comb over gets progressively worse. Man even faked his hairline."
AdviceNotAskedFor,Remember when a democratic senator got ousted for fake touching boobs.
castle_grapeskull,After the full throated support by the GOP for Herschel Walker no one be surprised. All they care about is another reliable R vote. They would run a convicted unapologetic child molester and say he’s Christian and has been redeemed.
belliJGerent,Pro tip: don’t hold your breath.
ubzrvnT,This will be the first GOP nut job called out by his peers. That means THIS guy is *just* below their standards!
SkipLikeAStone,They’ve had a month to call for this. Why did they wait till he was sworn in?
foofarice,Odd this push for his resignation is only happening after the fraud against wealthy donors is being revealed. Regular lying and taking advantage of normal people is just fine apparently.
Etherius,"I’m willing to bet $20 right fucking now that he runs for, and wins, re-election in 2024

Whether or not he *should* doesn’t enter into it.

If given the choice between a Democrat and this guy, the GOP will choose him again"
Blackbyrn,"As far as I can tell he is the new standard bearer for the party. All he needs is 3 baby mommas, a slew of bankruptcies, and a racist mouthpiece."
Lobanium,He's a Republican and therefore has no shame. No way he resigns willingly.
ACAB_FOR_CUTIE_,How could an esteemed volleyball star and war hero like George Santos lie? He could've gone pro if he hadn't lost his shins in 'Nam
krchnr,"They must know something, probably relating to campaign finance. Otherwise I doubt they would give a f***"
Straight_Ad9840,"""immediately"" has passed"
RestlessPoly,"They didn't care, until they found out that he took their money from their rich donors. 

GOP:

Lie to the American people = silence

Lie to your constituents = silence

Steal from the elderly = silence

Flee from criminal prosecution = silence

Take money from their donors = ""you need to resign""

Not even suprising that they are getting rid of the ethics office"

DanteRex,"What about his massive future lies? If he resigns, no one will care anymore when he claims to have accompanied Neil Armstrong on landing on a flat moon."
DaveOfTheDead3,But he won't and the GOP will do nothing ...after all they are the ones that elected him.
Sir_Clicks_a_Lot,The vast majority of the GOP have spent the past 6+ years worshiping an inveterate liar. Why would they expect honesty from someone like Santos?
tonyt0906,A bridge too far eh?! The GOP is so full of 💩
ballisticturtle,This guy looks like a pedo.
fistingcouches,What a system that you can just outright lie on your resume/credentials and when the entire population finds out - our collective responsive is to just shrug and be like “welp! Not sure what to do here.”
HeLooks2Muuuch,"INDICT👏HIM👏FOR👏HIS👏CRIMES👏

Why do they continue to give politicians and executives impunity for their ~~~white collar~~~ crimes? It’s absolutely disgusting.  Charge this miscreant yesterday."

Schiffy94,"The GOP has no right to be so mad at Santos. They've been putting up with this same shit for years.

IlikeYuengling,"I think it’s good precedent.  I’m currently rewriting my LinkedIn and indeed. I responded to the interview question about overcoming challenges with…Well, I was hunted once.

BattleChickenQ,"This is like getting mugged, then yelling ""HEY, COULD YOU PLEASE COME BACK MAYBE?"""
gadafgadaf,It's insane that there is no way to recall senators or house members from a voters perspective. It's up to concurrence of two-thirds of the House to expel him. Strange thing is with how morally bankrupt Republicans are now I dunno if Republicans are going to go for it.
8trackroadtrip,"If it’s really mental health and he’s a compulsive liar, wow does it say everything about how much the GOP wants power, at any cost with and bed fellows. It’s one thing to lie to the opposition but to lie to your own party, that’s the line?"
BrushOnFour," Hey if Trump can last four years with all his lies, why not Santos?  Both of them are major assholes, but Trump was still the most anti-war president in memory.  Santos is a major liar, but is that at all unusual in Congress?  I kind of like that so far he's saying, ""Fuck You.""  I give him the ""Prince Harry Award."" 

Trump said ""Fuck You"" and became President.  Santos lied and lied and became Congressman.  Now he's saying, ""Fuck You.""  Who knows how far that will take him?"
Starks,"Upon being told this, Santos is still saying he won't resign."
ChrisNYC70,If only

Ok-disaster2022,"He doesn't have to resign though. They can kick him out of the party and not support his reelection bid. Not sure of state laws for recalls or whatever.

Fast-Ideal5698,Why did it take take a full hayfield to find a straw to break the camel’s back?
Onwisconsin42,Nassau County Republicans might have some sense of shame. That isn't the case for the National Party. They are leaving Santos in Congress because they want power. Power is way way way way more important than any other thing to Republicans.
Glitch_Ghoul,About fucking time.
newfor_2023,nah. the Nassau County GOP should have taken more due diligence and vet out their candidates better before electing him. The National GOP in congress should also take action now and oust him before he makes a bigger fool out of the party when he continues to be a fraud in office.
reactor4,"Might as well ""wish"" him away."

2025 headlines will read ""Republican leaders shocked Santos sold national secrets to US enemies""."
OlynykDidntFoulLove,To be clear the seat would be vacant until the 2024 election; the House doesn’t do appointments or special elections.
3Heathens_Mom,"So per McCarthy while Santos shouldn’t be on any top committees he will apparently be assigned to at least one. 

Interesting in that for at least companies if you actually just embellish your resume you can be terminated. 

With the Republican Congressional Party in DC apparently as long as you are a warm body and vote for Kevin McCarthy doesn’t matter that the amount of true information on your resume is considerably less than all the lies."
Redipus_Ex,"Given what *everybody* knows about the GOP, and their conscientious lack of scruples, conman-santos has nothing to lose and everything to gain by digging in. After-all, it is his lying, cheating, and outright fraud that has opened the door to this wonderful new opportunity, aka *congress*. He's not going anywhere. He's only following trump's example. He's going to commit more *acts of congress* right there on the congress-floor. What would he get out of resigning?"
Fondacey,I hope he never resigns and is a daily reminder that the GOP knew all this and let him be sworn in.
