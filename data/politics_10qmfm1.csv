Champagne_of_piss,"And a whole bunch of conservative *meaniehead jerks* are trying to get Canada doing the same shit. By intentionally fucking up our public Healthcare.

Fuck ""starve the beast"" libertarianism"
VanceKelley,">Compared with other high-income peers, the US has the shortest life expectancy at birth, the highest rate of avoidable deaths, the highest rate of newborn deaths, the highest rate of maternal deaths, the highest rate of adults with multiple chronic conditions, and the highest rate of obesity, the new analysis found.

All while the US spends almost twice as much % of GDP on health services and fails to provide any health care coverage to tens of millions of its citizens.

The US has the most inequitable and least efficient health care system in the world, by far.

Why? What aspect of its history lead the USA to become so exceptional?"

Fun_Salamander8520,Yea it's legit crazy. I remember when the USA tried to do universal health care and I thought holy crap this is a step in the right direction. To this day am still completely baffled by anyone who is against universal healthcare and access to all through it. Like people are so dumb they are against something that can help everyone. I have no words at this point.

No gouging

Just go to the doctor and leave—we’ve got you covered.

usernamefromhell,"I'd argue that this is the biggest issue facing the US right now. I actively avoid any form of Healthcare unless I feel like I might be dying. It's absolutely soul crushing to see a bill for more money than you make in a year after a life threatening episode. Even with good insurance, you're still left with tens of thousands in out of pocket costs, that they will send to collections the moment you can't pay, like that helps."

Who knew? /s

All of the money is being sucked out of healthcare and the workers, facilities, and patients suffer without any effort to reinvest or improve. Just more late stage capitalism propping up the privileged and frankly incompetent corporate class."
xena_lawless,"See, the high prices actually guarantee the shitty system.  

Imagine paying a mafia for ""protection"" from tragic health consequences that might otherwise befall you without that protection.  

Now imagine that the mafia had gotten so powerful, that your employer is also required to pay the mafia directly for your protection...or else, some terrible health tragedy might befall you and put you into bankruptcy.

This is the system of health insurance in the US. 

Health insurance companies use a fraction of the premiums we pay them to lobby against universal healthcare that would save us tens to hundreds of thousands of lives and half a trillion dollars every year.

https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(19)33019-3/fulltext

Likewise, when you give your retirement money to Wall Street, they use some fraction of it to rob, enslave, gaslight, and socially murder the public and working classes, including you.

Essentially, we're being enslaved and socially murdered with our own labor and resources, like cattle building their own slaughterhouses.

It's an abomination of a system.

Yes, we should have universal healthcare.  

And it should also be easier to opt out of the American health insurance system and receive the employer health insurance subsidy as a direct cash payment instead.  

First, because it is an abomination to force people to subsidize the companies [socially murdering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_murder) Americans on a mass scale without recourse.  

Second, because it is often significantly cheaper to just travel and get healthcare abroad.  The competition could lower prices on the margins.

Third, reducing the funding that the health insurance companies have to lobby against universal healthcare could help in the long run, not that the cat isn't completely out of the bag in terms of the American public being robbed, enslaved, gaslit, and socially murdered without recourse by our abusive, financially diversified ruling kleptocrat class."
thevel,"I don't even care about the cost anymore (I've accepted the craziness)...it's the delays that have me fuming anymore.  3 months to see my primary.  Then he refers me to a specialist, which is another three month wait.  Then they refer me to their associate who can't see me for two months.  When I get done with them, they tell me it's not what they thought, and I'll have to see my primary to determine the next course of action.  This happened to my mom as well, they didn't catch her cancer in time, now she is stage 4 with few treatment options, palliative for something that should have been curable."
trembleandtrample,"I argue with people on reddit all the time about this, and the quality of life in the US.

Quality of life is dogshit, imo. Mass shootings, murderous police, out of control cost of living, artificially low wages, shitty expensive Healthcare that traps you in a job, shitty early education and insanely expensive later education, no worker rights, no real maternal and paternal leave, a broken political system, the list is huge. 

We are a failing country, and one political party is trying to accelerate this downfall as much as possible, while they convince their idiotic followers that they are the only thing standing between the country and ""communism""

Not to be a doomer, but I have given up on the US. It will take us decade to fix what is broken, and institute reforms that countries have already had on their books for decades already.

I'm figuring out how I can immigrate to another country in about 5 years or so, preferably western europe. It's just sad how undeveloped and barbaric our country is, when it could literally be the best country in the world, but corporate and oligarchic propaganda has convinced the rubes that we are already the best, and imo it is very much like north Korea style brain washing"
bored-now,"At the beginning of every year, I have to get in a battle with my insurance company to get them to pay for my migraine medications.  

Every.  F*cking.  Year.

I request a refill on my prescription, insurance denies it and says ""Hey, we'll do XYZ meds instead.""  I get my doctor to submit a prescription for XYZ, insurance comes back and says ""Hey, that's shit is expensive, have you tried ABC meds?""  I go back to my doctor to have them fill out a prior authorization form that walks through every damn medication I've tried, they submit it to the insurance company, who comes back and says ""Well yeah... you tried all those, but have you tried DEF meds????"" and I end up having to call them and be That Person on the other end of the line who yells at the Tier 1 level phone monkey until I can get someone with some authority to just approve my goddamn medication.

NYArtFan1,"The health ""care"" system in the United States is a fucking abomination. It's an inhumane, barbaric, extortionist system - literally, your money or your life- designed solely to extract as much money from you and deny you the ability to treat or cure your conditions. Health insurance companies are fucking parasites, which serve no legitimate function and only exist to act as a roadblock between you and your physician. The pharmaceutical industry is insatiably greedy, often using publicly funded research and then privatizing the medication. This entire system is indefensible on every level. That anyone in what's called ""the richest nation on earth"" should have to worry about going bankrupt, or suffering needlessly - or fucking *dying*- because they can't afford care or are being roadblocked by an abominable industry is not the mark of a great nation but of a deeply diseased and failing country."
Mitoni,"I got a new job that was a $30k raise over my previous, which was awesome.  Then, I found out that my $205/bimonthly check health insurance plan was now going to cost me $667/check, so an additional $924 a month, meaning that $11,000.00 of my raise was going to be eaten up by health insurance.

And it's not even that good a plan, it's an HMO with a 10K family deductible, meaning in most cases, they'll never pay a dime of my health costs throughout the year.

It was a real let down to see that."
danncyrax,I just found out my health insurance only allows me to see my primary doctor and specialists 3 times max a year before they stop coverage. That’s combined visits not separate. Having Covid and a follow up used 2/3 appointments and I have three specialist appointments in March… so… thank god I have insurance??? It’s fucking feb 1st and I hit my limit.

Do we have to? No. We're pretty good at helping others but sadly not so good to each other. The sad truth is that most of our decisions, as a nation, are driven by money. They pretty much have you over a barrel and are all out of that wonderful medical grade lube...unless you can show us the 💰 🤑 💸 honey. Sad for the most powerful nation that ever existed.

Granted, my insurance knocked it down by a bit, I still have to pay a bit over $1400 for them to look at me and tell me I'm fine.

GarysCrispLettuce,"I once had strep come on in the afternoon and by the evening I was super sick so called Bellevue emergency room to ask them whether it would be cheaper to get a penicillin shot from the emergency room or a local doctor chain that had late opening locations. Was told ""oh come here, it'll cost you far less."" I sat sick in their filthy waiting room full of druggies and alco's fighting each other for 5 hours, and then when eventually a doctor saw me, it was 5 minutes max as he did a quick test and then injected me with a simple penicillin shot. Got the bill a few weeks later - $1500 of which approx $1000 was an ""emergency room surcharge."" I just laughed at it and threw it in the trash and forgot about it. They sent me one follow up demand which I also ignored, and that was over 10 years ago and I've never heard anything more about it since. It's almost as if they don't bother pursuing people because deep down, they know they're in the wrong, lol. The irony is, if they had just made a reasonable ER surcharge of say, $100, and charged me $500 for the shot, I would have happily paid it (even though the shot is still severely overpriced). Their clearly ridiculous greed made sure they wouldn't get a fucking penny."

Disastrous-Golf7216,"Had to take my son to the ER. He was doubled over with stomach pains. Waited in the ER for two hours (there were 3 others in there) while he suffered. The look at him curled up in a ball on the bed and literally the first question I was asked is what insurance do I have.  I told them they said that we will be back. 45 minutes later they came back and said take him home and put a heating pad on his stomach. We are not sure what is happening. 3 days later I get a bill for over 3000. They did nothing, and this was supposed to be one of the better hospitals. Ended up taking him to see his regular doctor and they actually ran tests to make sure it was not appendicitis. He was shocked they did not at least try an ultrasound. 

So yea our healthcare in America is horrible. I pay almost 1000 a month after my employer contribution and get nothing for it."

timecrash2001,"The stats don’t lie. But I would argue that these values have less to do with the quality of the healthcare than the fact that the state is not motivated to prevent illness.

Only a few MONTHS ago that US state-run Medicare was allowed to throw its size around and get lower prices on drugs and care. So very specific drugs and treatments had to be paid at the price the private market set. Naturally, these prices were created not by competition but by cartels of providers. Government always pays the price, which means taxpayers and patients pay more than what is necessary.

As Medicare is a “provider of last resort”, it’s harder for the state to consider pushing preventative medical measures. The costs of health campaigns are borne by the taxpayer but the savings are captured by the private medical industry. 

The day single-payer exists in America is the first day that politicians begins to think about how they can reduce the cost of preventable, chronic diseases. The amount of savings on treating AIDS from a needle exchange was so clear that even the Conservative Party (aka the Liberal Party weirdly) in Vancouver Canada implemented it. It helped justify tax cuts. 

The profit motive sucks at providing inexpensive, quality healthcare. Period. The evidence is so thin that you need to nuke a public healthcare system to convince voters that there are better ways. This is the scenario in the UK and Ontario, Canada, where many years of Conservative rule plus COVID allowed them to blow up the structure to introduce private measures that will never ever replicate publicly funded healthcare systems."

Chiliconkarma,"US healthcare has a mafia-like nature. It's a beast that would be criminal in nations where good faith politicians had a conversation about it and could decide to choose the most beneficial form of healthcare. 

It's taking the healthcare that US personel, tech and organization is able to provide and selling it at highly elevated prices, in ways that seem comparable to prohibition. Where law vs. need vs alcohol culture shaped a market that made the price of drinks skyrocket and work against the hopes of anti-alcohol people.   
US could technically choose tomorrow to simply cut out a very large chunk of the price of healthcare, with no negative consequences after the process was safely completed.   
The mafia part of the US system doesn't add any benefit, it's simply a tumor on society. 

The reasons behind it not happening is the difficulty of it and for people that aren't afraid of the work, the bribes and scheming keeping the golden goose laying eggs."
Knightwing1047,"It's seen as a luxury in the US. Basic healthcare being given out is automatically ""socialist"" and evil because god forbid someone gets something without having to sell their soul and 1/3 of their life while only getting the bare minimum. This is also ignoring how backwards it is to fine someone who can't afford healthcare, thus making it even harder for them to do so. 

We like to claim that business is what makes America great but in reality it's what makes America one of the most corrupt and heartless places to live. We make a business off of the basics for survival. 

* We upcharge 1000% for life saving medication
* We price gouge to make a quick buck when it comes to giving people a decent place to live
* We price gouge food costs so people who can't afford it end up resorting to stealing or peddling lest they starve to death.

selkiesidhe,My doctor recommends a procedure. Insurance can deny it. That is a fookin' racket. The first question out of anyone's mouth is what's your insurance--- the money is more important than your health here. It is disgusting!
e_spider,Because the US has the “free market” myth for healthcare. There’s no real competition when the alternative is dieing. Maybe try comparison shopping for kidney failure.
YNot1989,"That's what happens when you design a healthcare system around insurance lawyers, executives, and doctors who became doctors because they wanted to get rich.  


A for profit healthcare system is always going to more expensive than a national health service."
Clandedos,"Damn. This is crazy timing. Started a new job, full coverage for me was $95. To extend the same coverage to my wife? $451 per month. 

At a $60k base salary. 

Fuck.

Edit: It frustrates me even more to think about it longer than 2-Minutes. We are two productive members of society, pay our taxes, are healthy - one of us is going to be a lawyer - yet 1/4 of our income is dedicated to basic life insurance. 

I truly do not understand why our elected officials would not want us to stay healthy & receive treatments we might need. Don’t you need us to pump out babies for the next generation of wage-slaves? 

This is one of the reasons we decided to not have kids. Rent, Car, Insurance (Health & Vehicle), Inflation on commodities; there is no way my generation (Millennial) is going to thrive. 

We are so fucked. So incredibly fucked."

DudeItsCake,"I live in the US. There was a time where I was between jobs and only had one vial of insulin left. 

Didn’t have any insurance because Cobra is really expensive. 

Thought I was gonna just run out and eventually be hospitalized because of it. 

I was 25 and was able to hop back on my dads insurance and get more insulin. (You can’t be on your parents insurance plan once you turn 26)"

So they sent her home since there was ""nothing else they could do"" - why don't you admit her and get it figured out?! Healthcare in the US doesn't cure anymore, it treats and keeps you in the system as long as it can so they can milk every penny you have out of you. I hate it. I'm legitimately worried about my wife's health and if she's going to get worse because they essentially did nothing. I almost lost her once to death. I don't want her to die"

CanadianRose81,"NO ONE should be surprised by this. This is why the people in the US NEED to demand that the US adopts socialized medicine like a majority of the world already has. People should not be spending thousands and thousands of dollars for tests and tens of thousands of dollars for surgeries. That's should ALL be covered. HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT!!! People should NOT have to choose whether they pay their bills/mortgage/rent or medical bills. EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE 100% COVERED!!!
If the GOP actually cared about the people (like they claim to), then they would be in support of giving them healthcare that would be COMPLETELY COVERED!!"
Icy_Background8771,"For profit healthcare is a crime against humanity. It goes against the universal right to life as well as the Hippocratic oath.
Profiting from the suffering of your fellow man is vile, in the same fashion as profiting from war. Most of the world's countries, spanning the spectrum of development, have nationalised healthcare systems.
None are perfect, but by God, most prevent the side effects that for profit generate. Getting sick is the leading cause of bankruptcy in the US. But lobbyists guarantee that it won't change very soon.
You have to start thinking about healthcare as an universal human right. The simple fact that the uninsured amongst the US populace end up receiving their healthcare in emergency wards contributes to the greater cost per capita of the system.
And when the emergency room is your first call for help, outcomes are negatively affected.
Thus lowering national life expectancies.
The system is penny wise, pound foolish !"
Rogueplayer4,Yes
BostonSamurai,Working as intended unfortunately
SwordHiltOP,"US also has the highest quality of care, and access to tons of doctors. The reason its so expensive is because hospitals and pharma have no reason to fix their prices because they get paid no matter what. We need competition in that space in order for us to get cheap healthcare"

OceanDevotion,"I’m from the US, and I’ve been battling stomach issues for years. Had a bad bout this morning and had to leave work, and as I was leaving, my co worker was telling me about a certain doctor her son went to for his digestive disorder. She said the only catch was they don’t accept insurance.  

So my only options for health care at this point is being poked and prodded endlessly at $500-$5,000 I’ve paid for each one; colonscopy (of course they had to use the expensive anesthesia on me), blood tests, stool tests, specialist doc appts, and on and on and on and on. It never ends, and it was so expensive, I finally just stopped going to the doctors altogether because I never was given any concrete solutions other than “change your diet, you need to be less stressed, you have anxiety” and I literally couldn’t afford the allergy panel or the CT scan they wanted because I’d lost so much weight. Healthcare is so stupid here."
Magickcloud,"Not to mention the shadiest doctors. Seriously, they’ll make you sick just to keep people coming back. Don’t let them die, just let them teeter. It’s sickening. The things I’ve seen doctors do to my wife is beyond criminal"

coswoofster,Daughter had routine doctor visit today. Cost $130. This won’t include any tests if she has them or prescriptions if she needs them. Those will be more.  Our health insurance premiums were so high for us as a family that we now have a garbage policy that pays basically nothing unless we end up in the ER or hospital and pay the first $7500 out of pocket.

Daledobacksbro,US Healthcare isn’t about living a healthy life or healing people.... unless you are about ready to die or be hospitalized long term the solutions are pills and procedures. Then more pills for the side effects caused by the pills they prescribed.

He refused to believe it, or that Japan, the country with the best healthcare in the world, has very cheap public healthcare.

jayfeather31,Shocker.
zedanger,"Now, you just wait here a gosh-darned minute.

Yes, our healtchare might be expensive. But it's just about better than any you can find in *any* of the countries we've been bossing around for the last century. 

Is it sometimes a problem that I have to choose between buying ammunition or paying the hospital bill for the gut-buster cheeseburger that got lodged in my esophagus? You're darn tootin it is. But that's what personal responsibility is all about-- you make a choice, you live with it, and then you spend 4-6 hours on hold with the doctors office to see if you might qualify for a fee reduction. 

Am I sometimes forced to wait weeks, as a minor health issue slowly transforms into something more serious, only to end up stuck in an emergency waiting room for more than a dozen hours? Well, yes, yes I am, but that's a damned sight *better* than the alternative in *some* places around the world-- like Antarctica, where it can sometimes take *months* to see a doctor, even for serious conditions!

Have I had to start to donate my plasma to afford my daughter's insulin? Maybe I have, but money isn't the only thing that grows on trees-- neither does insulin! What's next, you communists? Rent caps? Housing the homeless? PLEASE.

I won't claim our system doesn't have its problems, but I can go to sleep every night (sitting in a recliner because of an untreated lower back problem) and rest easy knowing that it's not only *me* that isn't getting a free lunch. No lousy ~~bla~~ *moochers* are getting a free ride on the property tax dollars my landlord pays from *my* rent. 

People need to pick themselves up by their own bootstraps, like I did, when I made four months of payments on my $100,000 hospital bill for a heart attack three years ago, before declaring bankruptcy.

People just want everything given to them these days, it's disgusting."
kevihaa,"These comparisons are valuable, but the missing piece is always adjusting for income. 

I’ve got no data to support it, but I’d assume both that unfavorable metrics for the US start to disappear at a certain income bracket, as well as that these data points would look even worse if focusing exclusively on low income households. 

I feel like this is important not to say that the US isn’t that bad, but to highlight that this isn’t a personal issue for folks who have the means to influence the political climate."
baguak4life,"My wife got ovarian cancer 10 years ago while she had health insurance. Her pils were $850 per pill. It still left us in almost $300k in debt. The healthcare system In The US is shit, period. Her illness bankrupted us. 

I pay $600 a month with a $8k premium for my “super good healthcare” that will only cover me up to $150k and increases 10% annually it seems

stlredbird,"Not surprising. Just recently my HSA card was rejected. Turns out there wasnt enough money in the account, i was shocked. So i printed the last 2 years of statements. At the end of 2020 i had $5000 in my HSA. $1500 get added every year. So that means i spent $8000 in healthcare costs for me and my son in 2 years and never hit the deductible of these high deductible plans they force us to take now. 

I had a few big tests in that time but vast majority was nickel and dime shit like a $90 telemedicine 10 minute phone call to the nurse practitioner at my docs office. Not even the doc. 

So guess who will not be going to doc unless im absolutely dying anytime soon?"

My son is on disability Medicaid and it covers everything including aba services. In New Zealand he was on a wait-list to see a pediatrician for over two years. The only medication he could get was melatonin because it's not sold over the counter like it is here in the states.
