Hip_Slick_Cool,"In April, Abbott began chartering busses to drop migrants off in other parts of the country, like Washington, DC, and Chicago, without giving those cities any notice — a program that Texas has spent millions of dollars on.

Texas had spent $12 million on the efforts as of August, the Texas Tribune reported at the time. By November, the amount spent busing migrants out of state had risen to $20 million, according to local outlet WFAA."
TintedApostle,They are incompetent and throwing more money under their control just means that his buddies will get richer and still blame Biden
slo1111,What about the $1B he wasted to help the Trump administration fundamentally paint border fence?  What a loser
Phy44,"Biden just needs to say it would be fiscally irresponsible to give Abbott more money after wasting so much shipping migrants to other states ""for the lolz"". Repubs love when you bring up fiscal responsibility, remember?"
dolt1234,"Maybe they should use some of the State of Texas’ $8.7B rainy day fund? Maybe the money they’re begging for should go to fixing the grid, like they were supposed to do ten years ago? Maybe they should spend their ESF on addressing Texas’ Maternal Mortality Rate, which happens to be the worst in the fucking country. 

Fuck Texas."
BioDriver,"One of the many reasons my wife and I are actively looking for a place outside this festering shithole.

Reminder that Abbott, our shock-jock-turned-lieutenant governor Dan Patrick, and criminally indicted attorney general Ken Paxton all won re-election by double digits."
Ready_Nature,If he’s got money for political stunts he doesn’t need more federal money. He can ask his own legislature to increase taxes if he misspent and has run out of money.
Alternative_Body7345,He wants a government handout? Thats socialism!
tpatmaho,So he went from owning the libs to begging the libs...
herpblerpsmerp,"Texas needs more money while having no income tax.  Time to tax those wealthy new Texans like Elon musk and joe rogan.

edit:

i get it, ya'll have other taxes.  i've got income tax, property tax and sales tax.  all i'm saying is these GOP clowns are more than happy to give tax breaks to the rich and get handouts from the feds.  Texas should figure out their own ""Elon Musk"" tax."

O0O00O000O0000O,"Hey, I for one agree with Greg, the numbers aren’t adding up. 

3~4 million tax returns collected from illegal immigrants using ITIN with their employment information per year

DyingToGetIn,I wish Biden would pat him on the head and tell him he already spent his allowance and should learn better fiscal responsibility
thistimelineisweird,"Texas wants Biden to say no so they can use it as a talking point on Fox News. Biden should ask them to show what theyve done with the likely billions theyve already been sent.

Texas is defrauding the US government with these human trafficing stunts. Personally, I think the federal government should be asking for a refund."
was_and_wasnt,Not one penny more.  Not one.  You've proven that you are a despicable human being.  One that cares nothing for those who are suffering.  You don't deserve to be Governor of Texas.  You don't deserve to be a resident of Texas.  You don't deserve to be a citizen of this country.
JimWilliams423,"In the span of just 10 days, that poser wasted $9 billion on an 'immigration' stunt — $4B from Texas and $5B from the rest of the country — that got literally no results.  He didn't intercept one single gram of fentanyl or any other drug.

Trygolds,He will spend any amount of taxpayer money for campaign stunts as will most other GOP elected officials.  The GOP will not spend any making the people's lives better.

DarkSophie,Why are they asking the rest of us taxpayers? I thought they were so independent. Independent enough to cede the Union in fact. That’s what they threaten all of the time.
ChrisNYC70,"Honestly, I thought Texans were not a fan of big government stepping in.  Let Texas pay for whatever they want to do.  As someone who lived in Texas for 15 years I totally understand how much the Republican party lie to their people and how much they want to remain independent from the federal government.  So screw them."

Asking for Federal money is just plain old socialism."
frenchylamour,"I live in Philly, where we are overwhelmed with \[mostly white\] opiate addicts.  


I would gladly trade Abbott one of our addicts for every two of his unwanted immigrants. I've worked closely with immigrants, mostly from Latin America. Those folks work HARD. They have FAMILY VALUES. They are COMMUNITY MINDED. They start small businesses. And, not for nothing, they often have awesome food and great tunes.

In the neighborhoods I canvassed during the 2022 election, if there was one thing that stood out to me was how nice and safe our low-income Latino neighborhoods were in comparison to the nightmare on Kensington Ave. So yeah, Greggers—I'm happy to trade you our white people for your brown people."

Smrleda,Abbott totally mismanages and now wants Biden to bail him out. Typical republican.

Ninventoo,I thought Republicans were against government funding?
NegativeGhostridah,sounds like that's *his* problem.
TomTheNurse,"(I have posted this before but I think it is relevant here.) 

There is a super easy way to stop illegal immigration. It won't cost the government anything and no one has to go to jail. Use those vile civil asset forfeiture laws and go after the ill gotten gains of the people who benefit from the labor of illegal immigration.  If it’s perfectly okay to seize a car or a home or a business for the crime of a little bit of weed then apply the same standard to those who commit the crime of employing illegal workers.   

If an illegal immigrant is stocking shelves at a WalMart, seize the Walmart and auction it off. If an illegal immigrant is working construction, seize the construction site and the assets of the contractor and auction them off. Working at a nail salon? Seize the nail salon and auction it off. Mowing my neighbors yard? Seize his home and auction it off. Working as a nanny? Same thing. Seize the home and auction it off. If a farmer is using illegal immigration, seize the farm and auction it off.

Do that a few hundred times and there will be next to no illegal immigration because no one will come here because they will starve to death if they do. But doing that will require going after rich white people who break the law of the land by paying them instead of the poor brown people who break the law of the land by coming here.

**-OR we could go the sane, rational route.-**

We could be honest about this issue. We could address the fact that paying low wages is the ultimate end game of the businesses that exploit this labor.  We could hold them accountable for shutting out American workers in favor of cheaper and more exploitable labor.  We could acknowledge the fact that politicians use illegal immigration as a cheap dog whistle in order to pander and stoke the fears of their ignorant base.  We could also address the fact that there is a place in our society and our economy that the labor of illegal immigration fulfills.

Personally, I think if someone comes here willing to work, they should be given a Social Security number, a warm smile, a firm handshake welcoming them to America and the legal protections in the work place we all enjoy. There should be swift and fierce retribution to any employer who exploits them.

I work with illegal immigrants everyday.  They are good, hardworking, decent, moral, human beings that only want to provide a better life for themselves and their families.  

Between 1910 and 1925 All 4 of my grandparents walked off ships and started working. They along with all working people are what made America great.

I will add that no illegal immigrant has ever hurt me. The demographic group of people who have hurt me have mainly been rich, old, straight, so called Christian, white men in suits. Because of them The only affordable healthcare I can get is through my job. Because of them I have a shitty 401(k) instead of a pension. Because of them I don’t have a union and all the protections they secure. Because of them my 16-year-old may very well be in massive debt by the time he graduates college.  Because of them that same 16 year old will probably not be able to earn a true living wage once he does graduate college.  Because of those old rich white men ALL of our rights are slowly being eroded away one idiotic piece of legislation and one ridiculous court decision at a time.  If the old rich white men have their way the world will be a toxic waste dump in a few hundred years because why leave the world a better place for future generations when there is a few more cents to be added to the quarterly earnings per share statement now?  Old rich white men are the ones who are truly suppressing this country.  

And yet people are still hung up on immigrants!"
iateyourcake,Maybe he should stop drinking starbucks and start meal planning.  I hear thats the thing to do to save money
HairTop23,"Take it out of his pocket. He had no business using funds on busing migrants to other states and the obvious money Laundering by these corrupt politicians, desantis im looking at you, needs to stop."
p0ntifix,"Don't they need first and foremost an updated power and water grid? Last I heard nothing much has changed on that front. Almost like they don't give a damn for their actual constituents. Rather waste money on wild goose chases, even though most illigal drugs and imigrants come by conventional means into the US. But I guess my European brain is just rotten with socialism or something and I don't get it."

bpierce2,He's free to tax his residents and raise the money in-state.
AltNationReality,"I don't doubt texas needs money to address the migrant issue.  What I do doubt is texas WISELY spending any federal funds on the migrant issue.

When you waste money making political stunts, they bite you in the ass when you actually need money.

smooothjazzyg,I hope Abbott destroys the Texas economy beyond recognition. Then maybe we can vote for the right person instead of this crooked sorry excuse for a governor.
cuernosasian,The republican majority in the House signals it wants to cut spending.
crtr_cat,"create an issue so that you can siphon more money, cool beans moron"

xSikes,Sounds like the governor is unqualified for the job
Andross_Darkheart,Ha! They spent all their money bussing illegals into the country that they ran out of money to keep them out of the country! This was a poorly thought out plan. I'm going to laugh even harder now! Hahahaha!
Appropriate_Chart_23,I can't believe this fucking guy got re-elected.
TomTorquemada,"Tax oil millionaires.  And you're a state, income tax is not your only tool.  You can tax property.  They can keep the first $10 MM, for their pension savings,  What's the rest for?  ***Political garbage***.  Tax it away."

C-ute-Thulu,"Remember Patriots, it's only socialism is somebody else gets the money!  /s"
Zanchbot,It doesn't matter how much money the federal government throws at problems in Texas. The legislature there has no actual intention to fix anything. They'll pocket the money and continue to blame Biden when things don't improve.

BrutalOutThere,“The party of fiscal responsibility” 🤡
TheSavageDonut,"Greg Abbott needs to come up with a plan on how to spend these new funds complete with progress reports, etc., and he needs to submit a request for those funds, and Biden gets to appoint a commission on monitoring Abbott's plan and progress.

IbanezGuitars4me,"Globalization mixed with wage stagnation has caused the younger (40-) generations to fall below replacement levels on having children.

ViewNo4267,"Imagine being such a twisted, hateful creature that you keep voting for a human trafficker who keeps using millions of dollars of your tax money to torment people who don't speak the right language or have the right skin color. You don't care that your grandparents and kids are dying every time the electricity grid fails. War-torn Ukraine is able to repair their bombed grid within 24 hours, but as soon as Ted Cruz bounces to a whole different country because there is no electricity in his home, you just excuse him with, ""Well, it's not like there's anything he can do about it!"" 

At this point, everyone who voted for the republicans in texas are aiding and abetting criminals themselves."

ace_urban,"Just a quick reminder that these fear-mongering lies about undocumented immigrants are the same lies that Hitler told about Jews.  

* “They are dangerous criminals”
* “They are undermining the economy”
* “They spread disease”

All of those are demonstrably false (Although republicans will use anecdotal evidence to try to defend those lies.  Just ask them for stats that aren’t from a qanon blog.)

Don’t let them get away with this disgusting bigotry.  Hold people accountable for their hateful rhetoric.  

Undocumented immigrants are a massive population (10 mil?) consisting of parents, children, friends, coworkers, playmates, neighbors…  These already-marginalized people don’t deserve to have their lives made even worse because the Republican base is hateful and ignorant."
Medium-Complaint-677,"Sorry Greg, that sounds like socialism to me."

humbugonastick,Has Abbott stopped rape yet?
akera099,"I'm always baffled by this immigration issue in the US.

The reason these people are crossing is that they're seeking a better life. If you have a minimum of empathy, you recognize that you would probably do the same in their shoes.

The fact that the Republicans voters think they can solve this without empathy is so laughable. This isn't a problem you can fix by building walls or paying buses. Europe has a 500 km water wall and it still does not deter these people in a quest for a better life."

Brucester62,"Abbott is no Leader. Why Texans think he is, is a mystery to many."
The-Tet-Corporation,"Abbot is an asshole trying to create bigger problems out of things that admittedly may be handled better, to push their own shitty agenda. As bad as social media is for human societies it also helps to let us see through the bullshit republicans are trying to narrate. Their “play book” directs them to do this so they can give themselves some kind of relevance in a society that no longer needs their outdated and cruel beliefs. All of this is of course for a shameless power grabs because they really stand for nothing more than the principles of Fuck you, me first and of course to keep America white and “Christian”. Fuck Greg Abbot, he has run Texas into the ground and set us on par with Florida, just fucking shameful."

Greg Abbott who lets his state freeze to death and wastes money on this shit. Matt Gaetz who's a pedophile and sex trafficker but no single republican cares. Trump being a sexual predator and an anti-democracy moron is their god-emperor. Roy Moore. Herschel Walker.

How can you simultaneously revere these leaders and spew the groomer shit, the family values shit, the christian values, how can they as Republicans not SEE the burning hypocrisy in front of their eyes. Not to mention how many times the staunchest anti-LGBTQ+ Republicans are found out to be gay or being with a trans sex worker. How can they not understand it's absolutely and utterly impossible to take them seriously. It's cartoonishly goofy."

JC2535,It’s time to introduce Texas republicans to the idea of small government. They just want to run up the credit card. But who’s going to pay for it?
coswoofster,"Yeah. Bill shit. No more money to these states who didn’t use COVID money, education money or any federal money for its intended purpose. We need more accountability."
I_try_compute,"Oh look, the classic *red state crying for federal hand outs* issue."
Flatheadflatland,The border is a national security budget item not a state item.
MoonHawk-,"They made their Bed by trying to be Wise-guys, now they have to literally Pay the Piper for their Stupidity… I am sure Gov. Abbot has allot of supporters he played up to, that can contribute to a GoFund campaign.."
g00fyg00ber741,The only thing he needs to be using money for is fixing their electrical grid so that people aren’t dying every winter from completely avoidable and known issues that he seems to not care a lick about.
Srw2725,This is r/leopardsatemyface territory
haltline,"Another stunning display of fiscal responsibility from the GOP.

Gee, I'm so surprised."
Tired8281,"Well, if we give them money for this, they'll just become dependent on handouts."
joeswastedtime,Fuck Texas.
Confident_Contract75,When are people going to realize that folks like Abbott don't want to solve problems? Their power depends upon generating and maintaining chaos and anger.
OutsideBoxes9376,"Maybe he should have been responsible and made better choices. 

You know, the same thing he and his ilk tell poor people whom they’ve completely fucked over."
rainbirdstew,fuck every single idiot that voted for this pig
SweatyBarbarian,Photo looks like he’s willing to do “anything” to get that sweet border money.
ktthebb,Fuck Greg Abbott
Bleatmop,"Cut taxes, plead poverty, ask for handout, get handout. Repeat."
mrmrskent,F Texas
space-dive,"so, abbott has been governor of Texas since 2015. I think it logical that Abbott should shoulder most of the blame for the on-going or worsening problems. He's been on the job for seven freaking years in texas. But, this guy feels it's appropriate to put blame on  the current president. Methinks Abbott is running from his responsibilities and inadequacies as a governor."
Due-League819,I thought only Democrats wanted to spend “government tax money”. I thought you wanted to secede from the US… go for it!
Stunning-Fondant-733,"As i read these comments, it is encouraging to note how many people know the truth about the level of corruption in Texas. I just wish the Republican voters would see it and clean house."
schwenkmom,Tell him to pay for that shit himself. Racist ass….
philburns,"Could the historic surge of $1.7 million people been because: 

1) the previous administration caused a panic in people who were thinking about illegally immigrating to the US because they think the policy could change back to being completely closed again, and 


2) people waited to illegally immigrate because the previous administration separated kids from their parents and it’s safer now we’ve stopped the barbaric, Russian-like practice of separating children from their families"
sidjohn1,"While TX has a 33b budget surplus…
