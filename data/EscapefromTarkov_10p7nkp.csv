Decent-Pangolin2064,It's a quest to kill 15 pmc on pier that's the reason behind it still shit
Shawn_NYC,"I did this quest last wipe (never again) and I spent about 30 hours listening to podcasts waiting for footsteps so I could murder some poor level 10 Timmy then go back to podcast listening.

It was one of my worst gaming experience of all time and I'll never go for kappa again."
TrickyCod208,That quest is one of the worst.
YTmrlonelydwarf,That quest is one of the dumbest quests I’ve ever seen but he’s honestly got the best way of getting it done. It’s unfortunate that you ran into him doing it but as the wipe goes on it’s only gonna get worse as more people get the quests
El_Mutchos,"Quests that require you to kill PMCs in certain locations should be removed from the game. Fair enough killing them on a map, but this quest is one of the quests that I refuse to do. 

I refuse to sit on the pier and camp a low traffic zone to kill Timmys.

It’s not fun game design, it’s not fair game design and it isn’t immersive."
ConsumeFudge,Thank BSG quest design for this one
Woahboah,Need streamers to convince bsg to change that shit quest.
Shadowraiden,hes doing a quest which is kill people in that location its a pretty meh quest because you essentially have to do what hes doing. just sit at that location and wait for somebody. most who end up going there are people like you who need to mark stuff.
SovietVillageBoy,Why does that sound like Trey24K?
buckets-_-,"Sounds like he was stuck doing Outposts

not his fault the quest is ass imo"
Improstor,"Its basically BSG fucking up a quest, such as ""kill PMC on Pier"", a place where mostly nobody even goes to.

The guy has basically no other option, but to sit like that and wait.. hope..

Blame is completelly on BSG part."
baddieinabeamer,average bsg task
Jazzlike-Jamaca4864,That sounds like trey24k
Shpongolese,"I'm just imagining the pmc chillin, watching cops on a TV upstairs, and just sighs as he hears steps approaching, grabbing his gun after."
greyjest25,"I read two story, and my brain went straight to dorms.  It’s police station, please, for the sake of your teammates"
samineb,The quests need a complete overhaul
rivensickomode,"I’m sure this isn’t the same guy since he was probably doing a quest. But one time I got ratted on by some guy camping Emercom tents on interchange. Obviously pissed, I lookup this guys stream and his tarkov content is LITERALLY just camping. The very next raid he loaded into labs, ran to red keycard room, sat the corner of it with a shotgun and watched YouTube while talking to chat. Just waiting. That is literally how he plays tarkov. This is why i have trust issues and act like there’s always someone camping me now."
Plastic-Reserve7315,"I think its a bit of shitty quest/map design. When I say map design I don't mean it in a black and white kind of way either. The maps in Tarkov are actually quite good IMO. Much better than most other shooters. Im not trying to say the maps are shit by any means lol.

BUT some areas of these maps are straight up ASS. Interchange for example. That maps needs built onto, or flat out redesigned in some areas. They need to add onto the side of the map by railway exfil and emercom. Because these exits get camped VERY often. People make their entire playstyle around camping interchange exits. Even name themselves things like ""ExfilCamps"" and ""EmercomRat"" or something along those lines that tells you, this player plays every match the same exact way. He rushes to an exit and camps it for 30 minutes with a bag full of food and drink so he can RGD impact a geared solo player who works for his loot. They don't care about getting good at the game. The way they play doesn't help them get better it just cheats everyone out of exiting the map. Other than that though Interchange is an awesome map. Its fantastic. It just needs expanded outside of the mall IMO and possibly even redesigned so these kind of players have a harder time exfil camping. Exfil camping is bullshit. If you exfil camp, congratulations. You're the kind of person who probably should've been a snail trail on your moms bed sheets.

As far as some of the quests... yeah they can be ass. I play solo so the difficulty for me is 10x harder on some quests. But when it comes to obj camping. You gotta take that L and learn from it. You should've cleared two story before you moved on the objective. Or maybe if you did that quest at night, it would help make you less noticeable. There's usually something you could of done differently that would of resulted in not dying on Tarkov.  This is what makes you a better player. Figuring out what you could've or should've done better, and applying it to all your future raids."
carjiga,"Now, i get what youre saying. but at the same time. was he doing outposts? cuz man might just be hating life sitting at pier for the quest and have nothing better to do while waiting. 

Also. its fun to multitask. If im wasting time waiting somewhere in tarkov. im playing fire emblem"
Admiral_Thrawn_7,"Bring a suppressed TT with you in every raid and whenever you’re going close to a building shoot the windows and pop a few shots on the walls. If a person is camping in the building they will freak out and think you’re a hacker, most of the time they are going to make noise and give away their position. You’re also hinting that you’re coming but it doesn’t matter since they will hear you anyways"
DucksMatter,I love cops.
OCWBmusic,He's Capturing Outposts.
AcanthisittaOk5680,"There is literally no other way of actually playing the game. The sound is so awful there is no advantage to be found playing aggressive since the other players will instantly know you are coming since they hear you from 200m out even if you're crouching. 

With the gunplay being as shit as it is there is always just a simple coinflip if you win so if you simply want kills for a quest, your best bet is to simply camp."
RicoSour,Just pop a red flare at pier and get your kill quest there done
noobgiraffe,"That's what I did to get scav kills in barracks. Sit in the dark corner, watch youtube and wait for a noise. I just wasn't getting any luck with AI so I waited until player scavs spawn and wander in.

That's why I don't like quests like this. It doesn't respect peoples time. You love to see that lightkeeper questline is filled with kill X in Y. I'm not going to even attempt to do it."
CY_Royal,Blame BSG for making quests that force end game players to camp early questers Lmfao
jarejay,Capturing Outposts is a godawful quest that should have never been added to the game and this is a perfect case study on why.
Senior-Solution-4300,Nikita is making him do that
meltsburner,hey it’s not his fault capturing outposts sucks fat. I sat there for a whole day watching the transformers movies while slowly getting my kills
StarChief1,So he's just copying what real cops do? Sit in an office all day and occasionally go shoot a man.
Etiketi,Lirik does this on streets without any quest. Watching office highlights and occasionally sniping people. Thats livin
Illsonmedia,He’s probably doing the 15 PMC kills on Pier.  Nothing wrong with that.  Go talk to BSG if you don’t like it. That quest was a bitch.
Full_Patient6283,"worst quest design

same with all the new lightkeeper ones

x pmc using shit gear at y location, hate that crap"
MaezinGaming,Can confirm if you don’t go sit there all game and camp you’ll never get the kills. I’d watch YouTube and chill until I heard footsteps
Lego_S06,Man’s a legend
LeMestache,What capturing outposts does to a mf
heathenyak,he's doing capturing outposts. if tarkov didn't want you to play like a shit bag then quests like this wouldn't exist... :(
paulfunyan,[Here is what he was doing.](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Capturing_Outposts)
TroleyWoW,Capturing the Outpost vicitim. Trust me peoples who are camping this quest dont want to be there either.
Vjekov88,why do many streamers watch cops now?
MagicSceptre,"Legit capturing outposts vibes, blame bag for bad task design."
ThePandagasm,"I was doing a scav recently on interchange with a buddy, I got killed by a pmc in the mall while my friend was making his way to extract, a group of 4 PMCs camping the extract killed him and had a ttv in his name, I open his channel, he's sitting in the back of a truck... Playing RuneScape and tabbing between games every 30 seconds or so. Different breed right there"
ralphy0420,Lmfaoo like a boss
stelkurtainTM,He’s doing Capturing Outposts quest.  Pretty funny ngl
Yungterpintine,Capturing Outposts is a nasty one
nvyus,He's questing fam..
ZeroUnits,"I did this one yesterday in a night raid. Night raids are highly underrated imo, was so easy; I spent 2 rounds on a scav and that was it other than the decent loot I got from health resort"
Kryptic-24,"Hey I mean, General Sam was walking around the house with wireless headphones while at d2. Anytime he heard metal he’d come back to his desk lmao. Definitely an interesting way too play."
Consistent_Pudding,This is currently my life while I farm Capturing Outposts...
Orlando1804,"Im on that quest atm and I feel bad for the ppl I kill caus theyre just tasking etc, its also INCREDIBLY BORING - I do the same tho I just watch netflix until I hear ppl - stupid quest"
RJohn12,if Nikita ever got asked about this quest he'd say something like 'is hardcore game if you don't like it don't play'
omegapenta,[How do you kill that which has no life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXAiBpIz2_I)
Accomplished-Lack-59,Angry.
Jmaestas719,Must’ve been trey24k
Veldyr,Yep dumbest quest in the game behind almost all of the lightkeeper ones
Shooter503,This was either Trey24k or someone roleplaying as him while doing Capturing Outposts. During his recent subathon I swear that man watched more cops than he played Tarkov.
KayNynYoonit,"Sounds like a stream I'd wanna watch. 

Who the fuck watches 'content' like that lol."
shtgnkllr,"He's chilling, no need to stress yourself by running around like a mad man when people come to you"
imoldbean,"Everything aside, that sounds like a really boring stream."
Throawayooo,"Blame Nikita for this, not the streamer"
autismo-nismo,"Pier would be more enjoyable to play on if it wasn’t a shit show just to get there.

It’s either a SBIH player camping near gas station or someone camping for their 15 kills.

But pier gives you really no reason to go there besides quests. I never find good loot there.

For example: therapist colleagues part 1, I will go there last and extract pier boat. It seems every time I go to pier and make it there I’m never able to make it back unless I have a teammate who can provide overwatch."
dashman85,Only reason to go there is early game quest then give an endgame quest to kill people there. Genius
somosa77,"Lol. He's my lon time lost brother I think. I sit on d2 with cs, cooking, washing dishes, watching YouTube. And I am also have TTV + streaming"
QuickKill,Capturing outposts. Blame Nikita.
that_vapeguy,fucking camping quest
muncken,I watched the entirety of this hilariously bad movie called The Core while lying prone on the pier for my task. Only took me like 10 raids to complete so wasn't really that bad.
Anna_Maria338,he´s an npc
sweeper_agent67,this is my truly realistic experience
Z0EBZ,This is the type of quests I thought they had reworked or changed with the wipe. At least we got recoil changed in a good way a bit. You can have your cake but you can't eat it.
FrogMonkee,Litterally if they would just change it to resort and change woods to sawmill this quest could actually be fun
reecemom,Is that trey
BANNED_JESUS,"If they didn't want you to do it, they would remove it from the game."
Comfortable-Ad4036,These quests get harder and harder to do the more people stop playing the game. Make no sense to have quests like this....
t0tezevadin,what an amazing game where the main gameplay is feeding all your time and effort to a guy afk with cops on and head phones that give him wall hacks
ArrivalSea1343,Every player I met is just sitting in a bush waiting to hear a sound just to alt tab from his youtube series/netflix and chill moment
magicsevenball,Was he working on capturing outposts?  That's about as interesting and engaging as that task gets tbh.
LightTrack,How does one watch a show and listen to audio in-game at the same time? I'd be distracted as fuck to notice anything even if my ears picked it up.
Differcult,"I'm getting really annoyed with everyone telling everyone else how to play this game.

I am a rat to the bone, I love camping, sniping, surprise kills. It's what makes tarkov fun for me.

3-4 times a week, almost always ttv, people take time out of their day to friend me and talkshit, because they don't like how I play the game.

I don't get mad because you haven't touched grass in a month are level 49 and are the definition of a Chad, don't get mad because you get ha from 300 meters."
djtheory8262,What amazing content.. he must have had all of 2 viewers.
ImDistortion1,"I’ve done that shit. Find a common rotate spot and sit with Netflix open. Free kills if you dont really feel like playing hahaha, rip"
straight_lurkin,That's essentially what I do for shooter born in heaven kills. Post up and watch a show on another monitor
CannyEz,"To be fair, he can play how ever he likes, don't be mad"
