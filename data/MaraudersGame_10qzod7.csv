RunningWithSeizures,You are my hero.
Hip-Harpist,"I love that you did this analysis, I figured by a rough estimate that the VZ-Klobb was the ideal noob cash cow for just 2 junk and 1 metal scrap (which you can get from free fire extinguishers in the Rustbucket).

$1000 for three simple pieces can help kickstart a beginner's wallet for sure. Other options will certainly net you better profits, but expending metal sheets/fabric might not be a regular opportunity depending on your luck while looting."
dungoof1234,"what did you mean by ‘profit’, is this if you are selling, or is it instead of buying?"
Alfonzo_The_Russian,"Since you can't buy scrap directly, how are you getting the cost for the scrap parts like metal, synth, junk, etc? Are you just using the selling value?"
lifeisagameweplay,So ships aren't useless! This is great. Well done!
BArhino,interesting for sure. kinda confusing for me at first but I figured it out pretty quick lol
