xRamee,Imagine the headache your PMC had before he finally died
mudokin,That helmet worked fucking overtime.
Cloveros,I've never seen anyone take that many headshots
VittorioMB,cheaters are such fucking scum
Ok-Street-7240,Damn I can‚Äôt wait when Nikita tries to play the game on Russian servers
Sea_Information_4012,"he was probably running a Reap-IR in his UMP with self-guided .45 Match FMJ, thats the new meta.. everyone is running it. :) /s"
RhymeAccel,I'm more impressed at how many headshots a ulach can take from .45 fmj without piercing. Thats a nice looking helmet
PopularPhilosopher99,"Imagine cheating to get loot of this caliber, you gotta be down bad to 10 headshot someone for this, then again they don't care cuz they prob aren't getting banned."
atled6,Ulach=best helmet
Salt_Nature7392,"Wow he out played you super hard he must have superior map knowledge and game sense I bet he watched a map guide on YouTube def not suspicious though could easily be replicated

/s"
Spliffty,"This weekend was really bad. I was hunted down multiple times with no loot and a benelli M3, so they're just out there letting us all know how they feel about the ban wave that supposedly came and went a week ago."
Enpallos,This game is fucking hot trash right now.
Travarianb,"I‚Äôm sorry, but fuck this game lately."
MBigz,This game really could've been so good.
gogupaul94,those skill issues are getting out of hand. You might need a better gaming chair
OK_1M_REL0ADED,Have you tried not finding good loot to avoid 10 headshots?
DrJugon,"Dude, none of these cheat developers ever thought of locking their aimbots to the legs instead of the head? It would be more consistent, much less obvious and would work even with the lvl 1 traders trash ammo."
Lucas1006,my friend found a red keycard and just managed to pick it up with like miliseconds left before he died
Event82Horizon,I cannot stand that shit anymore. Now is literally starting to turn into pure hate towards BSG for absolutely not giving a fuck about all of this.
svtdrew,Killed reshala and got golden tt after farming him for 3 days. Immediately after looting it. Headshot from a mp7. No where near me... white name. Name was even a meme. I was kitted with a GL.
carthe292,This is egregious. Also the oscope in your bag while there‚Äôs an AFAK in your secure container made me sad. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a thing you would‚Äôve changed if you weren‚Äôt busy being shot in the head ten times by a man who‚Äôs likely got 400 flea market rep & Darth Vader‚Äôs K/D. Sorry dude.
electronicfixdude,Went to pull my first ledx this weekend and got tapped as soon as i was dragging it over with no one around but my friends. Then pops the infamous white name cheater. It was great my buddy immediately died after. I was shot through a wall  btw in the middle of a building...
MontyStein,"Had something like this happen near dorms as well, dude opened up 3rd story ice cream side door and 2 tapped my buddy through two trees, switched sides and proceeded to 1 tap me. I hadn't moved for over two minutes after seeing my buddy get clapped."
SvalbazGames,"Fuck me mate, you took that better than I would‚Äôve. I hope you reported that loser"
Euphoric_Definition4,We all need to stop playing.
jjbombadil,At least it was for good loot. I get murdered for a spark plug and crackers.
BananastasiaBray,Rage cheaters
RayJay16,I spawned with a gingy thing and a labs keycard as a scav yesterday. It didn't take more than a minute for someone to fullauto me through the shelves in goshan (i didn't move at all after spawn as i didn't want to risk my keycard). The bullets went through at least 2 rows of shelves and the first few didn't do any damage till some seem to have penetrated them and hit my head.
Inevitable-Day-8654,The OP could have done everything right and it still wouldn't matter...no one but a cheater is landing headshots like that repeatedly and nonstop. The only reason he didn't fall out earlier is the cheater was using shit ammo.
Significant_Egg_9786,"Best Ulach commercial I've seen yet,  keep em coming!"
TheRealRailguy,I always thought helmets were a waste of money until I started running tier 4+. Its a game changer
rbstewart7263,Fuck I hate to add to the chorus but I'm glad I decided that this was the wipe to skip and play other stuff. I still get mad at titanfall 2 mind you but not nearly as much. lol
dagoodnamesweretakn,What‚Äôs insane as well is if you didn‚Äôt have a helmet probably most people just assume it‚Äôs tarkov and they got shot from somewhere you didn‚Äôt see. Then there‚Äôs this lol
EFTucker,"It‚Äôs just Lvndmark bro. When you play enough, you sometimes just get lucky! /s"
Alternative-Tour-558,Lol HElmeTS aRe USeLEss
Sinikal_,"Remember, cheaters do not exist. It's rare. Never happens."
BlackPrincessPeach_,"2 types of people.

People who say they don‚Äôt run into cheaters in tarkov and people who run good helmets."
NoPoliticsAllisGood,Me everytime after the lobotomy! üòÇü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Environmental-Wish35,Had this happen to me on shoreline except I had basically nothing in my inventory - same exact rounds and everything. I ran for a solid minute into the woods from svetly before I died from blunt force damage. Cheaters can eat shit.
JasePink,Died on headshot number 21 from what i counted
isad0rable,Skill issue
Ragabomd,I pulled out a slick on reserve - 9mm headshot within 30 seconds.
AetherBytes,"I have the same question as your fried, what the fuck was that helmet made of?!"
killerallen0703,All I hear is Run through the jungle playing
Dripgawdxd,"I don‚Äôt think or feel like anything is being done about cheaters, today I died to someone with something Chinese in their name like disposing ect ect, all head eyes, even if I am the one peaking. One shot or 3 all to the head eyes, head ears ect. I am just going to place a chargeback on bsg in the morning."
SovietCyka,"This video just makes me so mad that people can be so blatant and face nearly no repercussion and yet a streamer can get someone banned in a near instant. What the fuck BSG, just what the fuck?"
Funkyplaya323,Praying someone makes a better version of this game. üò©
NightLanderYoutube,"Now try labs for hideout items, 3 games was enough for me yesterday, I lost patience for this game and I feel stuck when I can't progress cuz of cheaters, losing 1m kits almost instantly feels good. Usually when you take shit gear they let you live and just vacoom everything."
jackt6,"While yes I'm glad that cheater had a hard time getting through your helmet, a helmet shouldn't stop 10 consecutive rounds of .45. One ricochet should be chance, 2 is a miracle, 3 is impossible"
Sad_Week9076,"but dude, I've been playing since alpha and have 47,000 hours, I only play 1 match per week and I already have kappa. Never seen a hacker in the game anywhere your first 17 shots all missed. git gud."
Kmieciu4ever,These hackers are a real headache :-)
hiddenintheleavess,"bruh i cannot believe the amount of cheaters in customs this weekend. i ran streets, reserve and even fucking shoreline without much sus but ran into back to back wallbanging cheaters in customs. so cringe"
Mollamollamolla,surprised legit people are still playing this game. so tired of this bullshit and people defending it. half the shit I've seen on this subreddit shouldn't even be made possible in the games code it's insanity. it makes the devs look amateur.
Poonamoon,Holy shit it‚Äôs so blatant. There‚Äôs 0 way someone was repeatedly tapping you in the head with a UMP without landing shots anywhere else that consistently through all the trees
PaladinKinias,"See, Reddit, THIS is what a BLATANT cheater looks like, not just randomly getting 2-tapped in the thorax when someone rounds a corner, or getting legged from distance by someone you couldn't see.

&#x200B;

Cheaters exist, 100%, but not every death is a cheater. This is undeniable. Learn the diff between ""Desync is terrible and / I got outplayed / I don't know exactly how I died"" and ""Hackerman 5000""."
LordSaladz,Nah he wasn't cheating.
sc0tt3h,There's really no point in playing this game anymore after experiencing something like this.
straight_lurkin,At this point I wouldn't be surprised if you were desynced from the server and on his screen you were running in place lmao game is broken as fuck
Sargash,"Didn't show the whole video, you cut out important context. He was righthandpeeking you, and honestly this just looks like desync. Notice how he didn't shoot you for half a second when you were standing still? He was tracking your audio ques."
joaohm2812,"My dude post a video of a scummer, and forgot the most important part: the name!"
Robeardly,Dude and here i am every time i wear a helmet i die top of head to the first bullet. you cant make this shit up rofl.
El_Oso_75,Homie found docs that had dirt on Hillary Clinton!
SluMpKING1337,This is why I'm playing Marauders.
MediocreCheesecake15,"Why would you play a high risk, high rew2ard game if you take the risk completely out of the equation? Just go play something else."
Kindly-Mine-1326,I started not picking up GPUs. Otherwise they come flying across the map.
Nickahplz,Lol this games dogshit
SnooJokes5339,"I tried to return the game 2 days ago. I entered a building in shore. Heard the guy, entered and check the building. When i was in my inv i heard 2 steps and he showed himself and instant death. Soo nothing changed when they solve the cheat i will try again i suppose."
CPollard187,That isn‚Äôt even that good of loot tho
Reddot360,Lol
TheGamerSK,MF got that stalinium helmet
ChattyDaddy1,I try to explain what it sounds like to get attacked by a cheater n00b baby and this is it üòÇ
Ricksterdinium,"Same, found a rig about 2 hours ago and was shot several times in the noggin while weaving and bobbing. Each shot connected."
jettman333,What did he loot?  Can‚Äôt see what it was in the video
thedrizztman,"One of the many benefits of never finding good loot in this game, and riding the perpetual mediocrity train, is that you generally never enter the cheaters crosshairs."
ElBlackStallion,"SameüôÉ I finally found 2 flash drives in one raid and got rushed while exiting really tragic l. HAVENT found any flash drives since :,)"
Believeinsquatch,WHAT HELMET
LargeSticker,Classic blunt damage headshot.
TrueS_t_r_e_s_s,"See, I've never had that issue.

Because I never get good loot anyways."
RockyWrench,This has me rolling laughing. The commentary ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your helmet made out of?‚Äù Broke me. High quality clip!
xxxDea,Ive had a decent run with cheaters this wipe. I have ran into 1 blatant cheater so far and only a couple that i knew were closet cheating (esp and similar). Its seemed relatively normal other than that. Maybe the cheating situation is better in australia than other places
SenatorCrabHat,"I mean, we all know that the .45 cal guns are the most accurate in the game, duh. /s"
Oniondice342,‚ÄúThere is no war in Ba-Sing-Sei‚Äù -bsg devs (probably)
MagicSceptre,"The way this video runs it gives the idea that the ""big loot"" was the bolts,I know it wasn't I just like to think that. 
   I can imagine a PMC like , shit no TP. Finding some and sprinting through customs to get back to his bunker to drop a deuce."
obvioustroway,Ahhh more justification for me to keep on playing offline. Can't wait for Co-op PVE progression
sadeqboom,battle eye chilling XD
ToiletGrenade,Man bsg and battleye need to get their shit together
ViciousPrimal,Thats me when I play Shoreline :)
SirSurprise,Yeaa... im not playing this wipe.
ALFA502,"how you didn't die?

and how is that hacker so bad he need so many shots to kill a sigma player doing some tasks in the game ?"
Immortalchungus,This reminds me of a raid I had on lighthouse did so well got a bunch of kills/loot and die to a guy hacking with like an STM-9 on top of the sniper rock. He hit me so many times in the head with 9mm GT rounds that I died from pure blunt damage
Ok-Life8294,cheaters target you when you have a lot of good stuff they need.
lordwerneo92,"Just a regular desync, happens a lot this wipe..."
Cryptic-scott,Damn hackers...
4seanthegr8,Why didn‚Äôt you show the name so we can report him too
KingAustonius,It‚Äôs probably a hacker
TehMangler,Lol I got jumped by 2 pmcs at sanitars cottage. killed one and weakened the other two the point I had him dead to rights. I quick peaked over to get not 1 or 2 but 22 magnum bucks through my tactek faceshield
Liisn,"What a bloody happy-go guy, man. Hilarious reaction xD"
Major_Stoopid,"Holy shit man, this should be posted in some sub similar to like praise the camera man. Atleast we now know its worth slapping a helmet on...lol"
mikeyboy1681,"Yeah this is pretty common for this game atp, not acceptable but common."
luton2468,u/savevideo
SatansAzzhole,better gaming chair
Salt7990,Ah I see you encounterd Xi_Jing_ping_ttv
Soft-Armadillo8957,Normaly i get one shotted in the head. yesterday i wore the shitty UN helmet i got shot like 5 tjmes while surviving. Helmets do be worth it
snoozieboi,"What if they made cheaters some kind of supernatural ghosts of the lore /s

I had a gfx card at Shoreline in  my alpha pouch, nothing else of value as I'm a junk rat. A cheater blipped into existence, I fired some panic bullets at him and he disappeared like some kind of 4th dimension controlling alien.

Best would be if they put all suspected cheaters in the same servers...and then made some kind of ""unfortunate system crash"" happen every time they exited with suspiciously good loot rates. Or something."
SnrSquishy,Whenever someone tells me helmets are useless I will link them this video
NalaTheDoggo,This wipe in a nutshell. Dying to hacker duos with shit ammo who only hit the head. Feels like trolling.
Sneaky_Rhin0,"same thing happened to me yesterday when i went shoreline with a flir, died to a level 42 called ceo****** added and asked how what and i got a gg ezi, i died to pistol ammo from 500+meters after 10-12headshots in a row? :)"
bobo1666,Dark and Darker where are you ? I need you now ! ;-)
crpiecho,.45 acp ( a cranium projectile )
Naked_Snake33,"NOOOOO THERE ARE NO CHEATERS IN TARKOV! 

Tarkov:"
eda1112111,"I met this types of PMC in Interchange. In my case, he used 7mm slug and shooted only helmet."
Sokaris84,"Got done by one on customs today too, same ammo! Unfortunately my helmet wasn't as good as yours and only ate 4 rounds :( sadge"
CustomerWarm6550,isnt that 11? becuase 1 more killed u?
TimmeTehWise,The loot vacuum detects a pinata.
luizsilveira,"""Bro, you can't know if they're cheating if they don't tell you your name in game. It could just be desync""!"
Shimi_1,"knock knock ,knock knock 

,,Who is there ?,,

knock knock ,knock knock knock knock ,knock knock 

,,AAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAaaaAaAaaaAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaa.."
PckMan,"Yeah bro that's the new laser guided FMJ rounds, they're a real killer"
Maggiespharm,"Anytime I find anything good I give up on escaping alive. It just doesn‚Äôt work for me. I can survive all day finding shit, then find something I‚Äôve been looking for or something rare and a blade of grass I step on cuts my foot causing instant black out to both legs and heavy bleeding in all limbs and before I get the chance to stop the bleeding, my PMC gets pneumonia which depletes all of my stamina and carry weight causing me to be over cumbered which does damage to my blacked out legs which results in health points being taken from all limbs causing me a very quick yet slow, painful, agonizing death."
MonumentalSin,Tarkov's damage and health system is absolutely ridiculous. The amount of times I've been 1 shotted in full armor vs the number of times I've shot someone in the chest or head multiple times just to die by them turning around or shooting me once. It's incredibly annoying.
Firm_Woodpecker_1875,so tired of all the same post over and over no your not dieing yo cheaters every raid stip running to reddit everytime this happens we get it theres hackers . and its not as bad as everyone says it is
UnusualDifference748,"Is that really good loot? Lions and oscopes aren‚Äôt really rare items. I have 5 lions and I rarely go to hotspots, they spawning a lot it seems this wipe to me could just be my rng on lions being through the roof. 120k for lion, 80k for a oscope. Your gun is really nice too. It just doesn‚Äôt feel like loot a cheater would kill you for, not saying it wasn‚Äôt a cheater but your loot isn‚Äôt the reason they killed you."
,[deleted]
AdSuccessful991,"Used to hack once WAAAAAY back in the day.

Yeah, this is hacks. I've rage hacked for lesser loot before."
cth777,Not to mention you also died noticeably after the last impact. Assume desync or something
FreshFunky,"Ahem: I have literally played 12907 hours and never encountered a cheater. You were in his line and he‚Äôs using a low recoil gun. No cover at all just walking and wondering why you get headshot. Skill issue. 

/s"
No-Manufacturer-5310,Damn that man has the aim
savvysnekk,"I just died to blunt damage recently as well, although it wasn't a hacker. I had a diaper rig and the guy who killed me shot me twice in the arm using 7.62x39mm PS and then shot me 4 times in the body. PS failed to pen every time. After the first two body shots, the PS ammo failed an 89% chance to pen and then a 96% chance to pen. Weirdly lucky for me except PS does a lot of blunt damage."
Mercinator-87,"I felt with streets coming out and how that usually goes with bsg, that this was a wipe I should miss. So far I feel vindicated in that thought process."
Zaneath,So mods just pick and choose when to enforce rule 7?
Flashy-Claim-5309,ThERes NoT aS mAnY CheAtErs As YoU ThINk
toyn,There‚Äôs been an influx of questionable only getting head shot the past couple days. Makes sense. Usually takes hackers a a month or so to update their code to work with the new patch. Expect a big ban wave in a month or so.
