KentuckyBrunch,"The recoil and RMT changes are so fucking stupid. RMT is bigger than ever so we might as well just go back to where we could sell shit. You should NEVER balance your entire game around cheaters. So sick of being punished because of cheaters. And the recoil is just so aggravating. Nikita claims to hate metas, well guess what bub, you know what makes metas less prevalent? When a ton of shit is usable. My fucking trained operator shouldn’t have a semi auto AK shot cause the scope to jump 5 feet above the target. Shit’s just so wildly inaccurate."
tylo17,"Bump. Upvote. Etc. totally agree with you dude. Battlestate has failed to control RMT so they have taken extreme actions on the remaining community to curb it. It isn’t working. It’s just making more people leave the game. Reserve and interchange used to be amazing. Now, they’re practically worthless."
LITF,"I agree with a lot here. I get the intention (at least alleged?) behind restrictions on the flea, but that ain't working out. In the past it was a great feeling when you unlock it and any (almost) build becomes more or less available to you, and you don't have to keep 3 spreadsheets open to hoard the right barter/quest/hideout items, you don't have to hoard random stuff that you are not even sure you may want to use ""just in case"". Instead you just convert all the junk into cash knowing that should you need it later you can just buy it. Sure, maybe you lose money on rebuying stuff you sold, but I'd rather loose some cash than hoard and keep track of multiple spreadsheets of found in raid quest stuff, upgrades, barters for the stuff I need/want, that random adapter I need to install my preferred sights on a gun, etc.. It's just awful now. And it removed the social interactions with friends/teammates, where you could share some quest items between each other, or upgrade items.

Indo welcome some changes, namely the high end ammo ones, because I think they may have a potential to make high end protective gear feel like it actually does something in late wipe, and extend the mid wipe fun, but I'm not convinced on that either."
Wunon,"100% agreed, started playing 5 wipes ago and the game isn't even a quarter of how fun it used to be. It all comes down to balancing and fighting RMT, they tried to fight RMT with restrictions, that failed, they took drastic actions that hurt the community, and that failed too and caused more people to leave. And then the idiotic balancing that has no logic behind it (1 use quest keys, ammo restrictions/removals, etc.) 

Anyone who argues that it's how BSG visions the game to go and will ignore all suggestions/complaints, that's how you kill a game. Just ignore all criticism and be stubborn."
kiddquadd,2019 was peak Tarkov
glassbong_,"Didn't start that early but I've put in 4k hours and I agree, this game is a shell of what it once was. What used to be a tacticool sandbox with a ton of freedom of play and great PvP has since become a tedious grind simulator with mechanics that just simply don't feel fun or interesting enough to deal with to justify that grind."
hiddenintheleavess,"bsg nerfs and punishes the playerbase into oblivion in the name of fighting cheaters and adhering to hardcore realism. 

nikita has said for pretty much ever the game will become harder and less people will like the game. while i agree with your points, is pretty exhausting seeing these same points made every single week. 

the game was better before 12. it was an entirely diff game before 11.7 and even more so before that. flea changed the game. FIR further changed it. restrictions will continue to mold what we can easily attain, which seemingly isn't supposed to be much. 

change is a double edged sword.  i do think that as a ""beta"" there's far too much grinding involved but they clearly stretch what it means to be beta."
Legendary-Anarchist,This 100%. I miss having fun in this game. I was just talking to my friend that got me into this game like 3-4 years ago about how neither of us play anymore cause of the downward spiral this game is taking.
StoppedKarma,"Agreed. I don't hate all of the changes they have made (the ammo changes this wipe are good imo) but I understand the impact they have on the community. This game was already super grindy and they have somehow found ways to stretch that grind out further, from RMT measures and super low spawn rates for bosses to the new time gated quests and quest locked crafting (which in turn can create quest locks). I love this game because there really is nothing like it. 3300 hours, 5 wipes wipes in and I feel like I'm starting to lose steam because it's becoming a job to play and not a hobby. I think there is a happy medium to be found somewhere out there, BSG simply doesn't care enough about what it's community thinks to attempt to even find it. Every wipe it seems like we get 1 QOL improvement for every 2 steps back."
Johnd106,"Couldn't agree more. I took a step back about three wipes ago and haven't felt like playing since. Thousands of hours played and fully enjoyed every second. 

It burned bright and for new ppl, I'm sure it still burns bright but I can't do it anymore."
Wardozer-,"This game is really shit now.  It’s fucking inexcusable and in sick of all the white knights around here defending BSG, fuck off, we have every right to be mad.  They ruined perhaps the best game I’ve ever played and made me hate them as a developer"
Minimum-Impression63,The op is not wrong. Bsg continues to push players away
TigrexETH,"I am so surprised this is getting upvoted everyone tells me I play the game too much and being level 40+ I shouldn’t have good gear.

This game was so so so much better when FIR wasn’t a thing and labs was free lol.

I miss those times, bring me back. Shit was amazing."
Nokami93,"Idk I play since release and most updates were pretty good. Still the most unique game on the market. I played like 10k hours and there is no game on the horizon that could compete even in the slightest. 

There are issues but some people here have complains or suggestions that are not feasible for a indie dev that makes a game which has already more content than most AAA games. Most people on this subreddit lost track who actually makes the game.

I miss only one thing and that is the small community which the game started with. Now we have this whiny circlejerk because the game got so popular. No wonder they abandoned any communication. I don't agree with all the changes but I respect the fact that they stick to their vision of the game. The whole game was/is a passion project of Nikita."
Uncle_Bobby_B_,BSG has ruined this game by fighting cheaters. The cheaters ruin the game less lol
GodIsEmpty,"I disagree I bought the game as soon as I could(my parents wouldn't get it for me so it was literally as soo ln as I could get a credit card lol. (2016) but I feel like the game has become more of what I expected when I bought the game originally. The earlier wipes felt arcade af. Now the game has made some changes to make it less like a ""sandbox"" but that was never the original vision nor what I expected. I think alot of people just got used to the game as it was and thought thats it. The only changes I didn't think made sense (for what I signed up for) are the addition of flea in the first place(no auction house is lame too) and honestly I hate the headphone meta was way better before that."
SlumberFumble,Started playing in 2017 and I couldn't agree less to be honest. Do people not remember the god damn 10 DC's a raid and the STUTTERS!! And literally having half the playable content ? This game is more fun now than ever despite the audio bugs
FlawlessRuby,"I started playing in the glory streamer days. Game was harsh for a solo player like me, but being able to rat and stack backpack in other backpack was a way for me to profit when I killed a chad.  

I was using the flea to fuel my hideout and was slowly getting quests done. Even manage to get Kappa on my first wipe as a solo only.  

Near the end of the wipe they put a GIANT nerf on weight. My dude stamina was draining after picking off a few items. (I was tunning mostly shitty paca and mosin)  

Than next wipe we have FiR that made doing most quest super hard.  

They also nerf flea market making it so I can't profit.  

I just quit, it wasn't fun at this point. Wtf is it wrong for me to love flipping shit in flea? I was having fun and people got what they paid for. A bunch of decisions got made to ""hurt"" RMT/cheater and some to make the game ""hardcore"". Seriously I feel you. Old Tarkov was more enjoyable."
Countcristo42,"Just out of curiosity which of these do you think weren't good additions to the game?

* Hideout
* Jager (and all his main items like Sicc case and RR)
* Reserve
* Customs expansions
* Flee market
* Lighthouse
* Streets
* Woods expansion
* Scav karma
* Daily quests

Because I personally think all of those are good updates since wipe 2, and most people don't have that many fingers on one hand"
truupR,I guess the vision the Devs have for the game are different to the vision of the game you'd like. It happens. It's shit. But there's not much you can do. If the game becomes *that* unenjoyable then I guess it's time to uninstall and go play something else.
AncientRelief9479,"I have the exact same feelings, been playing since 2018 and played each wipe too, all on the promise of the future of the game, we were lied to plain and simple, I even used to be a BSG Sherpa, biggest waste of time in my life, this game has been slowly dying for a long time but this patch and recent changes have just nosedived it so much further, nearly all veterans I know have quit already, and new guys will not stock around as long as we have, the playerbase will eventually fall off quicker than any other wipe and I don't see it rebuilding, the game is in an unplayable unacceptable state, and the streets hype they sold us and lightkeeper cocktease, all the cool additions they told us about, it was all a pipedream, fuck BSG and screw Tarkov. 

- From a former dedicated fan and veteran player"
Newguyiswinning_,"BSG realized only streamers make them money. As a result, every awful change has been made by them to benefit streamers"
EfficientWasteOfTime,"Reddit suggestions literally fucking ruined this game. The Mosin Nerf was the beginning of the end. Nobody talked about how absurdly P2W EOD was. Of course the game is going to end up where it is. This is literally what everyone asked for LMAO

Someone take me back to 80 thorax meta, .308 and 7.62 were good. 5.56 and 5.45 were both meta. The SMGs were all great, everyone had gear. You could just PvP and sell gear for loot. It was literally just more fun. By week 2 I'm already sick of every wipe, I can't wait for Dark and Darker to come out."
The_Corrupted,"Yeah, I agree as well. I feel like I'm done with Tarkov at this point, it's just getting less and less fun. The tedium increases every wipe while all the problems remain or get even worse and I'm just tired of it. I moved on, I'm not mad, certainly got my money's worth, but it's sad what the game I loved has become."
Thesaladman98,"There was another post of someone who's been playing since 2017, and they said every update was positive. I disagree with that.

I've been playing since 2019, and I remember back then, there were hotspots, people rotated maps every other week leading to new fun pvp (idk how or why it happened but every few weeks there would just be a random ass hotspot where the whole lobby went every raid for a while and it was some of the most fun possible, like resort i get it was a hotspot but every raid for like 3 months the whole lobby was there pvping, so fun.), so many good gun choices es that were fun, you didn't have to grind max traders if you didn't want to, you could just spend 800k on a gun build instead, so much fun.

Now we're at ""grind traders and quests so you can pen and buy class 4 armor, use the one gun that still pens class 4 armor, use the one build that doesn't have horrible recoil, and pur up with some weird ass side quest bsg is on to stop cheaters by removing incentive to cheat instead of removing cheaters."""
Aceylah,Agreed. Tarkov was a better game 3 years ago.
wrongday,"Last wipe and this one are 2 serious let down. I always try to defend the game with passion cause i dont enjoy any other shooters since tarkov was released.. but i agree. All the work arounds to fight cheaters and rmts just end up pissing off straight players and cheaters/ hackers are still rampant.

Audio is worse with every patch, servers are melting down.. the rubber banding makes street unplayable.. which is a shame cause the map design is so FU\*KING great. I mean its a masterpiece.. but you cant enjoy it.

Did we talk about lightkeeper? The first in game trader who 99% of the players wont ever see cause its streamers content? Kappa been lvl capped , another thing 99% wont ever see because of the pure lvl grind? 

I try to get friends in that get false perma ban.. others who crash half of the time.. its getting harder and harder to convince people that this is the game we used to love.

just died cause of massive rubberband on street, /rant"
TheRealTeapot_Dome,Ive been playing since same time and I think despite the hackers and audio bugs that this has been the funnest wipe... i love the ammo nerfs.... i love streets.... i love knowing people who started playing this game this wipe.
tacobellisdank,"Yep, game is definitely worse than it was a few years ago. Such a shame but oh well. It's still overall one of my favorite games out there."
Noox89,"Yeah agree on everything, I’ve played 7 or 8 wipes right around when they started resetting our strength skill and then completely nerfing the base strength to the ground. So much so that I’m 120 raids in and only have level 2 endurance because it’s basically impossible to not be overweight. 

The weight system plus inertia plus performance makes me feel like I’m playing this game on a N64 controller."
Austindj3,"Honestly all of it can be traced back to the addition of the Flea Market, while it's an amazing tool and I use it all the time, it completely changed how the game worked. It's also when RMT and cheaters became a huge issue, it made it so easy for people to make real money off of it that you had people start ruining the game for everyone else to get a quick buck. Then the restricted what items can and cant be listed or brought into a raid to combat that.  


While I still enjoy the game now, I really did like the game better before the flea, was much rarer to come across people with insane gear and even more rare to see a cheater. Being able to drop trade anything with anyone was great too, especially to help out friends who were struggling or new to the game."
CritiqOfPureBullshit,i still lol at how bad the grenade throw physics are. the game's engine is fucking terrible.
finedamighty,"As someone whos been playing for 6-7 wipes now i must disagree with alot of the opinions here. 

Fir change was good, after it was introduced you could see a drop in hatchet runners since the loot they stuck up their butt wasnt as valuable, addinf cursed and tagged helped that even more. It wasnt fun when half the lobby was naked trying to rush the closest gpu, ledx or whatever else spawn that made good money. This also helped with being able to buy good ammo from traders, since people used to buy out the stocks and sell on flea for 2x the price or more

Fleamarket restrictions also imo help slow down the wipe in general, otherwise you could have people running the best gear in a few days.

Quests needing fir sure is a meh change but atleast a chunk of those items now are easier to find or you can straight up craft them (gas an sucks tho still). No1 forces you to hoard all the items though, you choose to do it yourself, you can just sell the hideout items too and buy back when you need. 

Guns, there has always been a meta lol, just that the guns have changed, id say theres more variety to guns now though thanks to the new guns added + more attachments and not having access to all the best stuff right away. As val/vss or m4/hk were almost all you would see at some point. 

Item dropping changes honestly at this point really dont make as much sense though, a quick bandaid fix over an axe wound. If i find a key i have already but with half the hp why cant i toss the old one to my friend and keep the new one for myself. 

Ammo changes i actually like, but that should have been done on the day of the wipe. Again changes up the game, you want the best then craft it or find it."
loongod5,If I had a shot for every time I saw a rant post on this sub in the last three weeks I’d be genuinely dead.
Timely-Spinach7733,"I'm sorry, but I don't agree. I started playing 3-4 years ago and the game is objectively better than it was. Has more content, fights are much more responsive and interesting from my experience and the game balancing is getting there.

You say that there's only 2-3 usable guns, but truth is, when I started, it was all HK/M4 full auto 60 round 995 hipfire from 50m away while ADADA and rushing shoreline or interchange to shove ledx and GPUs up your ass. That was the experience.

I prefer the longer fights now that reward flanking and positioning. Choosing your shots, because (unrealistic tbf) recoil won't let you hit everything from far away and ammo/Armor is not as determining as it was. Still, full autoing on close quarters -20m is still very much the way to go.

Maybe it's a matter of taste gampleywise, but I find this new way of playing more interesting.

As for content, now you have some nice new maps, great reworks such as woods or customs and early wipe you find a bit of everything without having some map always exhausted by the chads rushing the hot spots. Inertia/Armor changes/hideout changes/quest rebalancing/FIR items rework and lots of content in forms or rigs, weapons, items and bosses. They even improved the night raid experience.

Not saying that everything is perfect. The Killa change you're absolutely right, and there's tons of things to fix/improve. And surely, there always will be a meta. But for some wipes now, I find I can play as I want and make profit/progress in quests and kill players."
Quadfur,"It’s not even a shell, it’s a completely different game with elements of the past. And it’s going to be more and more different."
Garchonga,Stop playing then.
Frig-Off-Randy,Agreed in a lot of ways. This game is pubg and we’re unfortunately still waiting for the fortnite to come around
MalevolentMinion,"There are 2 different EFT games. There is the current state and the future state. You enjoyed the current state years ago, and you don't enjoy the current state now. This makes sense.  This game isn't for you in its future state.  You've likely gotten your money's worth at this point. Move on."
Dazbuzz,"I will laugh if BSG just said fuck it and reverted all the changes. Cheating would become even more rampant, raids would be empty because we would go back to the meta where squads/chads farmed bosses and leave the raid within 5 minutes.

I swear all people want is to be able to boost their friends through all the games progression by dropping them gear/keys, walk out of a raid with almost a mill in loot, and run the best gear every raid with their unlimited roubles."
LaS_flekzz,"Yeah, every time something is fun, BSG will find it and move it away to super late game (or not buyable at all), or nerf it totally.

AP20 is op? move it back super far. Instead of trying to balance it.M80 is strong? move it back super far. Instead of balancing it, so it fits into the progression?

Instead of balancing the actual rounds or weapons, they just move it back in the progression, or just delete it from the game.

At this point, just get rid of the Flea market, get rid of traders. Get rid of levels, just loot.I used to run shotguns with ap-20. Back when nobody used the slugs. Didnt have to grind this game 8 hours a day just to use something decent.

Somethings fun? cant have that. Gotta nerf everything. With the newest changes, 80% of people wont have access to 80% of stuff that is actually good and usable. Only the 30-40 Recoil guns actually perform like guns in a video game should. The rest is pure ass."
Magnar_The_Great,This one will make them fix the game
paulmonterro,"Saying an old Tarkov where there are laser beam guns, no heal animations and adadad spam, easy money farm and hatchlings.
A typical Reddit karma moment. Enjoy your upvotes while people silently enjoying the game."
irze,"I’ve been playing for 3 years and I agree that every update has made changes that have made the game less fun for me personally. Starting with found in raid, to inertia, to flea restrictions and now trader restrictions.

All of these changes are probably good for the long-term health of the game but I do miss a lot of the freedom of the past. Still my favourite game though"
richard31693,"While I don't think everything that has been added, removed, or changed over the years is a good choice, a lot of the issues you're having aren't solely to blame on BSG. What's really happened is that over time, you've been more exposed to what's happening behind the curtains. You see more of the problems now that you know they're there. And the community, as well as many wipes of knowledge and experience, have refined the game into a meta. It's what gamers do nowadays. Everything has to be min/maxed and it creates this aura of ""if you're not doing this, you're doing it wrong."" Again, not everything BSG has done is something I personally agree with, but it's hard to look back and say the game was ""better"" when it wasn't the game that was better, it was the experience you had with it, and that gets multiplied when looking through rose-tinted glasses."

Kboehm,🎻 here you go.
RealKamesennin,"There's only one solution to tarkov: paid for cosmetics

BSG's whole let's pay the bills by recycling cheaters system needs to end. 

The game is not worse because of RMT changes... The game is worse because of cheaters, that's it. A proper anti cheat would make this the best fps game out there.

Imo with over 3,5k hours nothing ever came close to it in terms of addiction in the fps genre, not even close.

Of course there's rubber banding, the tick rate is absolutely abysmal but the game looks better, is more complex and challenging than any other online FPS ever.

I played MOH:aa, BF2 and BF3 semi-pro, PUBG, Apex legends, CS GO, COD, all over 1000k hours, none ever made me hooked as EFT"
pierce768,I stopped reading when you said only 3 guns are usable. It just simply false.

Chiefx14,Does anybody have other recommended games for when you get tired of dealing with Tarkov?
Branrivera,"I completely agree with you, I get the urge to play the game especially when I watch streamers play it but I want to play the game from 3 years ago not the state that it is in now.  So I just remind myself that and end up not playing lol"
thing85,If you feel that only 3 guns are usable perhaps you need a spoonful of git gud.
Dyyrin,100% went from a gritty hardcore tactical looter shooter to Chad injector popping W key simulator. I miss how EFT use to be. Sure some guns could be lazers but at least it was leagues better than what recoil we have now.
Siisco_TTV,"This sub is fucking unbearable lol. If you don’t like the game, don’t play. I don’t understand why you have to come here to feel justified. Just quit playing. 

The flea market change was needed- you shouldn’t be able to run into a store, shove the best shit up your ass, die and get rich. It’s risk/reward, not reward/reward. 

The game was full of naked people running around, hovering loot, dying and ruining the economy. Everyone bitched and moaned about it, and they changed it. 

Loot was so stupid bountiful everyone was rich. A few wipes ago I’d just buy moonshine for the thicc items case. We all should be scavengers, not filthy Rich. It should SUCK to die. Getting 100million rubles, buying a red keycard, then getting back to 100million shouldnt be a thing. 

The game 3 years ago was full of cheaters. People flying across the sky, pulling shit from our character, pulling loot from room, wall hacking, etc. I’m level 24 and I’ve not encountered a cheater this wipe. I’ve died plenty, but those deaths I record and rewatch. It’s because i made a dumb play, so I say GG and move on.

Are there things that need fixed? Sure it’s not perfect, but I’d take this game in its current state over any other game on the market."

-flea nothing of note? What? Are we just making things up now? 
-Cheaters are definitely not more rampant, however they are still here i agree

Seems like you forgot that Nikita said that he will slowly take out or switch things up until he gets the game he wants. All of these things are tests. 

You can complain how much time it takes but at the end of the day it's his game and he gave all of us 500+ hours easily (in my case 2500+). That's more than any game out there except for couple. We got our money's worth.

He doesn't owe anything to us. You all think he does but sorry to burst your bubble he doesn't. 

And maybe you have outgrown the game. Could be a time to move on. I do think BSG understand that."

And we've both pretty much stopped playing once they did their ammo switcharoo bullshit the other day. Not necessarily because of the ammo changes, but because of a lot of things that have added up. 

The game has turned into a masochistic pain simulator void of any fun. 

1. The scavs have literal built in aimbot and wall hacks. 
2. More and more players are turning to cheats because either game is harder and so full of bullshit or they're just tired of dying to other cheaters. 
3. There's never been more cheaters on this game than right now. All these nerfs only benefit cheaters more. There's lag where there never was before. 
4. Spawns are fucked. 
5. Audio is completely broken.
6. They keep limiting shit that keeps people playing under the guise of appeasing to the bottom tier of players that never play long enough to get max traders anyway instead of appealing to the players that actually play their game.

It's just hell. The games always had problems, the games always been bad. But it's never had this many issues or been this bad."

alexjml444,"Played every wipe since December 2019. I’ve played during times when the market would unlock at lvl 5 and “found in raid” didn’t exist and I can tell you that finishing every mission where you could buy the stuff from flea made the game less fun. 

In 2-3 days without much struggle I would get to lvl 20 and the get bored because all the other missions would imply killing PMCs in certain conditions that made it impossible due to the fact that there were only chad geared players at the time of the wipe or that the places where I would have to do something would be infested chad sqauds. Right now the game focuses on not speed running everything and I personally find it more enjoyable knowing that even after 2 weeks of wipe there are still people that need to do Delivery from the past ,for example, just like me. Ffs, back then when there was no weight system you could carry loot from 5 chads with your scav in dorms and that would just ruin the experience imo. 

I love that they added: karma feature, found in raid, weight system, flea locked until lvl 15. 

Before I started playing I know that there were no headphones in the game which tbh I think was better considering how fckd the sound system is right now. Questing should be remade and also procuring quest keys should be a bit more at hand ( like having 2-3 spots/map, one of which would for sure have the key spawned there ). 

Cheating is always going to be a problem for every gam and if you go into warzone’s reddit or any other mainstream game you would find people saying it’s never been worse. It’s been worse before and you’d know if you played tarkov a few years back.

Just enjoy doing your questing and stop trying to speedrun everything. The game is not a pvp only game. It’s supposed to have you work trying to get to a level where you afford to not give a f about gear or stress about questing."

BukLauFinancial,"When they added the FM, the game got worse.

When they added weight, the game got worse.

Say what you want (inbox replies disabled so I won't hear it anyway), but the game was more fun when it was a video game and not a realism/anti RMT sim.

I think one of the things I loved most about dark and darker was never worrying about if what I had should be saved. Just unload it all and be done. Problem solved.

BSG went off the deep end with complicating mechanics. Like the fact they want to add stimming teammates, knockdowns, and all this weird shit and interactions to the game... just why... They're just adding layers upon layers of useless stupid shit instead of fine tuning the piece of gold they're sitting on. It's like their development room has ADHD. They can't just focus on finishing a task. They're just constantly bouncing around to new weird shit they want to add instead of fixing all the problems.

I notice they don't like doing grunt work at all. They like working on animations and visuals and programming new mechanics... Because at the end of those, there's a dopamine hit when you see your final work done. It feels good, and thats type of work they prefer to do... but when it comes to the stuff that would just make the game work or run better, improve performance, fix problems.. that seems to be 5% of their focus, if that. The fact that they keep changing AI is a huge red flag. This is not a PVE single-player game. AI does not need to be a focus. The dumber the better. Do you think anyone who's played dark and darker is thinking ""wow I wish the AI could flank me, do different things, and snipe me from 300m? That would surely improve my experience..."" Just no. Learn simplicity.

And then the other part, like you said they have too much pride. They can't admit when something is unpopular and not wanted, because they can't accept that they wasted their time on something. I was shocked they toned down the weight and inertia problems as much as they did, even though it essentially took them multiple wipes to do it."
pthumerianhollownull,New wipe > old wipe. Disagree with you.
MalcomTuckersRage,"Totally agree, I stopped playing 3 wipes ago, I jump back on to see what’s new and it’s worse than it was before I’ve switched back to dayz."
oske2,Removing flea market barters would massively hurt RMT
2-Skinny,"Hot take: it ain't that bad.  Not perfect, room for improvement, but not as bad as all the whiners in here make it out to be."
CanadaSoonFree,You sure it’s not just burnout?
TeeRoww,"I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY. Ive played this game for so long now. Took time off in the middle of wipes but always came back. It just seems like theres no rewards playing this game anymore. Used to be oh I went into factory and killed 12 PMCs with just grenades and grinded my ass of to do it now i finally get BP. (and thats the same with all meta ammos) It just seems like theyve taken all the rewards parts of the game out for me cause i play his game every night for 4-5 hours and grind to be good at it and get the good gear before other people and all I usually end up doing with it is running M62/M61 in a DVL and go snipe on customs because thats fun for me. Just seems like they want us to craft every good thing in the game and wait 15+ hours to do it. My friend whos plays with me doesnt play as much used to barely get to be able to unlock M62 and now never will because of all these shit changes theyre doing to the game. Audio sucks, ammo sucks, armor sucks, and prices for everything are going up. Might have to hang my hat up on this wipe."
gruglu,"Playing since 5 wipes. For me the game is much better than before. It's hard, it's rewarding and most importantly it's kicking you in the balls. People keep forgetting that's the beta and they are playing the game still in development. 

""Still in beta, final product may change in the future""

Bought the beta game and proceeds to cry bcoz changes. 

No good ammo to buy? Great for me, and all others, working 40+ hours a week, having babies etc.

One time use keys? Grab another. That's how the quest works.

Audio not working again? Servers on fire? Would be awful if you paid for full product but the game is STILL IN BETA. 

""Boo goo they are pushing small usless changes and not doing {insert big change}. Yea, bcoz it's easier to push new weapon from the stack of them to keep you entertained, than REIMPLEMENT THE WHOLE AUIDO SYSTEM?!"

Galaxize,"Been playing since around when Interchange came out.

The period of time where they nerfed weight is when it really started imo. Somewhere around that time. That's when they just started nerfing literally everything enjoyable. Ammo gets nerfed, movement gets nerfed, market gets nerfed, loot gets nerfed, keys nerfed. The only thing that gets buffed in this game are scavs. They've made it so difficult to do literally anything enjoyable and have fun. All good ammo is borderline unobtainable; The joy of finding rare keys/keycards is gone because you cant even sell them; You can barely loot a kill without being overweight. I could go on forever, but I get they want the game to be super realistic but you're right, it's a shell of what it was. They've somehow gone backwards in development. The way the game feels is just horrible right now. 

Id pay extra to have some sort of arcade version of the game that has no limit on weight or movement. In other words Id pay for them to rollback 2 years of updates."
re3mr,"Unpopular opinion in this thread but; I agree that the game has issues but have you guys noticed that the vast majority of people who are so tired of the game that they compare it to PUBG also openly say that they have played EFT for thousands of hours?

Meanwhile new players are having a blast. Maybe you just played it to the point where it stopped entertaining you because you've seen it all & learned the whole meta game. 

I doubt you are longing back to the pre-BattlEye days at 2nd wipe. The game was a literal shell *then* of what it is now."
StealthCatUK,"The game is becoming more and more what BSG envisioned, you don't like it and that's OK."
furious-fungus,"I love it. They’re slowly creating the game they want, the opposite of PUBG. You’re angry because they decided they don’t want to be pubg. 

Ironic how you think pubg went bad because of stubborn devs, while pubg bent their backs to be more casual and mass friendly, marking their downfall. They lost their vision and made the mass happy, which was short sighted and unviable. That’s what you’re asking from bsg now, which would destroy them and their game, like it did with PUBG. Smart. 

They promised a stalker like hardcore shooter, why do you think them staying on that path is bad?"
malissalmaoxd,"It's sad because i really liked this game, but these wipes have been really bad. Idm some changes, but the flea used to be the highlight. Idm if they make it harder to make money. But atleast reward me for making money. Now I can't build cool loadoits cuz it's banned"
PigasusGaming,"honestly at this rate they need a legacy and production version.  
There are so many people who miss the older balance of tarkov, but many who like the game slowing down. I for one would love to play a legacy version of the game that just implements Lighthouse + Streets. Keep the OG balance (no inertia, no flea market restrictions, better loot, better pvp, etc) and just add the new content."
JKRob,You are all just burnt out or simply getting old.
deathzombie15,"You can blame a large majority of it on RMT, cheaters, and streamers, people just want to make money off of everything they can, and unfortunately ruin it for everyone else, just like in other hobbies such as collecting hot wheels or trading cards, it’s ruined by greedy people that don’t actually enjoy what they are using"
delate199405,"It's the weapons, inertia and loot for me. I miss the HK/M4 days and I had a solid run in shoreline which would net me good money. And I also loved pvp in resort. 
Now every single fight feels like luck with all guns being absolutely trashed with recoil. 
Oh unless I grind to lvl 4 traders to finally play the game. 

Games done for me unless they revert changes but they won't. They're too proud and think they've made a master piece. Dillusional at best."
PeterUrbscheid,"I completely agree with 2 of your points. Big keys feeling bad and flea market slots. I remember when it happened but i forgot the reasoning why they did it. Does someone remember what reasons bag gave for those changes?


I don't thing bag did everything wrong though. Scavs having decent loot now and ammo scarcity is imo sth very positive"
PlayMaGame,"Flea market was the best thing for me in tarkov. I could buy or sell anything. And yes most of my profit was from flipping. So I quit tarkov as soon as they implemented items found in raid thing… and reinstalled the game only to check streets of tarkov. What I see now is that the game is basically a single player with some coop PvP action. Everything else is craft it, trades up, or found in raid. I know they try to fight RMT, but this is killing all the freedom I had few years ago… And now I am forced to do what tarkov wants me to do. One more update, and I feel that soon enough I will be playing single player tarkov game, the only interaction it will be PvP."
MrMolesley,"I remember the rush of finding tetriz or roller, because i could  sell them for a nice profit on flea. Wth do you even have now for that loot dopamin rush? Ledx? Rest is all horseshit"
InevitableCheese,"Been playing since around the same time, totally agree. Haven’t seriously played a wipe in a couple of years now."
Accurate-Fox9427,"Agreed, they fucked up the flea and everything to combat the cheaters, but you see how that worked out"
KingN56,I may be in the minority here but despite the lag issues with streets and the cracked scavs which seem to have been fixed mostly I have been playing this wipe and enjoying it with friends more then any other.
Mips0n,Bro. The Game doesnt get worse year by year. The Game is ancient. And you burned out on it.
davstoned,I see the problems as do you. But why is there still a fuck ton of people playing the game?
Fexxzz,"I think the wipe is more exciting than previously. I barely see people running class 5 armor, most ammo I get killed by is not high end ammo, fire fights usually last longer if you don't get shot in the face, I only encountered 2 raids with blatant cheaters (out of 80 raids so far) and haven't had any server issues worth mentioning.

The previous raids were bitcoins were 800k or some shit were fun, but they were also boring because gear was essentially meaningless. Everyone could afford the best ammo, the best guns, the best armors and the game went from being a looter survival shooter to COD on interchange. Some may have liked that but hey, fret not, that's what you can do in Arena I guess when it comes out.

I prefer the slower pace and bigger rarity of items. For all I care if you think the game is complete shit: leave and return the next wipe to see if you like it more.

I do agree that sound is utterly and completely fucked and perfomance is degrading with each patch. I have by no means a top tier system but I'd expect to be able to run every map at AT LEAST 60 fps with a 3600x and 3060ti with 32GB RAM. But Streets is a complete mess and Lighthouse at times is only bearable."
muncken,"I was there for the rise and fall of PUBG. Tarkov is making all the same mistakes. The game will not make it until the devs have a serious wake up call about this reality. But whatever, literally no point to complain about stuff anymore. The rational thing is to simply uninstall the game and move on. Tarkov is the one that got away, unlucky."
sadroobeer,"You just spoke my mind. Been playing since early 2017 and watching/ keeping up with since mid 2016... It feels like it was all uphill and fun till about 12.0 and reserve. 

I think that time of the game was truly peak tarkov. 

The nerfed recoil a little. Just so no laserbeam guns were around but everything was pretty much balanced..

Every gun had it's place in the meta. You could build anything into either a budget gun or pvp gun. While choosing to prioritize ergo or recoil which actually made a difference while taking into account price. You could have your own little mix of everything monster gun. That just doesnt exist anymore. Get recoil or die while shooting over the enemy. 

Every map was unique and had loot but also had a purpose to run. Everyone liked their own map. One was not objectively better than another.   
The flea market was a utopia with no restrictions and 3 trade slots. I know people were bitching about reselling high trader attachments to the market but it allowed people who didnt want to grind out fifty customs quests to get decent mods and ammo for a decent price point. Like i never did too many Jaeger quests but i could buy his items for a decent markup on the flea...

There weren't a million and one grindy annoying quests. 

Twitch drops was actually good and worth watching for.

Ban waves were frequent as they didn't want to upset any new players joining the game

The new years/ Christmas gift was actually really good and helped out in the new wipe

You got a reasonable amount of XP from raids and didn't have to solely rely on quests or grind a fkton

No impact grenades or grenade launchers.

Scavs were a decent threat but not terminators. Especially the fkin sniper scavs.

Nikita was active on the sub and cared and connected well with the community.

Barter trades for armor or guns were actually worth it.. Like why would i trade 2 golden TT's and 2 gold chains for an AVS now... 

The hideout was just implemented and had normal crafts.. not 20 hours for mid tier ammo.... higher end ammo was still available through traders while the highest end ammo was only available through finding or crafting...

It's sad to see a game ive supported and watched over for so long make such horrible decisions and take a nosedive like this.. Like it hurts to see.  
Hell i even bought 2 standard editions and an EOD edition for my buddies to play the game with back when i was just washing dishes and making minimum wage."
REPOST_STRANGLER_V2,"The flea market problem, if you've got shit tons of stuff just sell it to traders and only sell the high ticket stuff on the flea, this way you can get into raids faster and bring more loot out and sell to traders."
Kaneypoo69,It's all because Nikita just doesn't give a shit.  He's said before that he's making the game that he wants to play. So nothing will ever get better. I bought EOD a few wipes ago and since then the game has gone worse and worse
Reduvia,This is what happens when you have a game that caters to the 0.1% of it's playerbase.
TJBAnarchy_,"I had always thought of uninstalling the game. I’ve played for just over 2 years and man I feel you. I came when you were still able to find weapon cases in marked rooms and marked room keys were less then 100k roubles. Dorms was a place of cheerful chaos. I adapted, I tried my best to change my play style and I finally found one that worked. M1As have been my go to since I first started playing.

My beloved m80s. Oh how the mighty have fallen. I am a casual player, I’ve reached Kappa once in my 8 wipes and having both m61s and m80s locked behind PK4. That was the last straw that broke this chads legs. I am finally going to Escape from Tarkov. I have a small bit of hope that makes me wanna think that it’ll improve, that they’ll listen. But who knows.

Goodbye and good luck in the raids"
masterscout9,Now I wanna now which updates were positive for you
arkantos91,"Can I ask what are the changes on killa op mentions? Just out of curiosity, I’ve not been following for the past years. I’m just a casual wondering what made him almost impossibile or luck dependant as op says"
Conserliberaltarian,"The way the game used to be was not conducive to a long wipe cycle, which is where BSG wants to take the game. However, it was a fuck ton of fun. the rush of finding a key in raid worth millions, fighting over nearly guaranteed ledx and GPU spawns, being able to quickly gear up with any attachments and any armor at a low level if you wanted to. It was a ton of fun, but its really more suited to a rust style of wipe. 

Imagine Tarkov with 0 flea restrictions, no quests or trader leveling, everyone only has level 1 traders, Skills wipe once per year, but everyone's stashes wiped every 2 weeks. That game would be a fuck ton of fun, and it would be infinitely more approachable to casuals."
Szeszkin,"Completly new player here. Bought the game like 1.5/2 week ago, on christmas discount. I got  50 something raids and SR 22%, 12 kills, where only 2 are other PMCs. I have fun, I cannot say anything about past of the game. But from the point of completly new player I can see few, in my opinion, big problems for new players.First, lack of actual good matchmaking. I have no chance againt anyone with hundreds hours of play time. I would not have a chance even with someone with like 80-100h, with the same gear as I. Yet, I am put into lobbies with full geared, experienced chads. I don't need matchmaking based on gear, I need matchmaking based on skill, playtime, SR, come on, Tarkov keeps a lot of stats, God damn use them. And if NIkita is not interested to think about it, call Microsoft, they have their own MM system.Other thing, items from secure container are not FiR. So it basicly means for me, as I am getting killed constantly (by scavs and pmc alike), that I cannot do any quests. Spawn is random, combined with sheer amount of items, well good luck, I spent dozens of raids to get the bolts for workbench. Thank god items for hideout does not have to be FiR, or I would spent months to get lvl 1 of anything.  
Still only 1 salewa turned in, I cannot find anymore and survive with it outside of my trusty alfa."
SLEDGEHAMMER1238,"The game is definitely going down a slode filled with shit and urine don't let the dumb bsg supporters tell you otherwise all the ""bsg is working at their own pace"" ""bsg is working hard"" thats bullshit clearly bsg doesn't care for the game or community and they are probably planning on a new shitty game for 90 dollars to drain peoples money 
I agree that the people who made tarkov were very talented but the executives are some of the dumbest people in any game company i know , i wouldn't be surprised if all the og devs that made tarkov have left or got swapped since the updates have slowd down immensely and they cant do anything right anymore

What a dumb decision it is to put all budget and effort into making a shitty new map that is expected to not work and on a game that has yet to become fully playable at that 

Its as if they are dumb and overambitious they should know to focus on fixing game mechanics,bugs and reworking older maps way before working on a new that will only spawn more problems and overwork for the devs this shit is crazy i don't knowbwho makes the decisions at bsg but omg what a stupid money hungry cunt"
