Zavodskoy,"BSG has been copyright striking videos of the various offline mods for EFT for a while which is most likely the reason OP's video was removed but I don't work for BSG so I have no proof that's why it was taken down.

Leaving this post up though as it's important that you can all discuss this issue especially if it was an incorrect strike on BSG's part."
Ghost4530,Never forget ‚Äúnegative hype‚Äù fiasco
wanderaloneOvO,"Ye it's well known in Russian streamer/YT community, even small content creators (I'm speaking <5-10k subs) were striked for creating videos BSG didn't like."
BeefyZealot,BSG is a terrible company.
Zavodskoy,">WITHOUT SHOWING CODE ONLY SNIPPETS OF A GUN SHOOTING IN RANGE.

I'm assuming this was one of the banned tarkov mods? They've been copyright striking those videos from those mods for years

Edit: it was I remember watching the video"
SuperNoodlePlays,BSG is a shit company. There. I said it.
Ivandragosgopnikson,They did this to Eroktic as I recall and he stopped playing the game and making content over it. BSG can be little bitches over valid criticism.
Solaratov,"The ""it's just a beta/every game has cheaters/make your own game if you think you can do better"" clowns will defend this."
turbogaminguk,"I got a manual ban less than 5hrs after a video about how I was stopping streaming due to numerous issues with the game. Back in 2020 I think it was. I'm a tiny creator, and so it was a big surprise that they even saw it. Unless it was a bizarre coincidence and just related to the bugs I experienced. I'll never know as they never looked into it like they said they would ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Edit: words"
Martizong,Ah... Eroktic 50 dmca strikes. Those were the days...
strike_it_soon,"You have to understand, BSG does not care about the community or the game. They only care about making money. So everything they do is only for the purpose of convincing people to buy or upgrade teh game.

this is why they give streamers special treatment, because they think streamers are great for convincing people to buy the game.

it's why they dont deal with cheaters. because 1. cheaters buy multiple accounts and 2. if you leave the game, you already bought the game so you leaving = less load on the server.

it's why they push out maps like streets that are unplayable. because it looks good on trailers and on streams but unless you have a top tier system, you can't play. but streamers can so that's good enough.

it's why when a big streamer gets hit with a big bug it's fixed instantly. or when a streamer gets incorrectly banned it's quickly fixed. meanwhile many people say they have been falsely banned for years and no resolution.

a video pointing out flaws is bad for BSG bottom line. but it's good for the game because it helps the dev improve their game. but BSG doesnt care."
AnthTWolf,"I remember when Eroktic threw so much hate and facts about cheaters, IRL money for in-game items and many more and BSG literally copy-striked him lmao.



So like....the game is early acces but they don't like getting criticized or having facts spoken in their face. 




Also, Nikita said something about cheaters that didn't sound like a joke, it was something like ""I wanna see how big their pockets are"" (stating that cheaters are re-buying the game if bannned). This was absolutely disgusting coming from someone who needs to seek the game grow healthy and implement things like phone verification or something."
marniconuke,"wow every time i'm even more dissapointed in bgs. like i'm not one to complain about the state of the game cause i like to imagine they are working very hard on it, but stuff like this is pretty serious to me."
Alskdkfjdbejsb,">	BSG has in their EULA stated that they hold all copyright of their game and can use that against you

>	they proceeded to copyright strike my video 

Tarkov‚Äôs EULA doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the copyright system on youtube though. 

The copyright strikes are based on copyright law. EULA just applies to your Tarkov account."
PigasusGaming,"honestly DMCA's over the forbidden mod are still a little silly. I've not seen any other game hand out DMCAs over mods for their games (maybe some smaller titles, but nothing from bigger companies that I've heard of)."
DopeyLo420,Someone finally read the fine line. Hate to break it to you but 90% of video games have this disclaimer as well as ‚Äúyou own nothing and the company can chose to take it away‚Äù. People really just be agreeing to anything without actually reading. It‚Äôs in the EULA of every company who puts out anything digital.
SwiftBetrayal,Honestly after the last year of progress and drama with BSG I‚Äôm surprised this game isn‚Äôt just dead. I understand it‚Äôs one of the only few in it‚Äôs genre but come on people. Stop supporting rubbish.
BF1shY,"BSG has a real ""my way or the highway"" problem.

The single player mod is superior to live Tarkov in MANY ways, yet instead of learning from it and making their game better they just ban anyone who mentions it.

If they made real co-op single player mod player numbers would PLUMMET SO HARD, because many users don't like the sweatiness of Live, or waiting 5-10 min to play just to get one tapped by a geared dude.

Some ways single player is superior: graphics are better, no lag or desync, you load into a raid in under a minute, you decide boss spawn rates, you get to play how YOU want, you get to adjust time and weather, you get to see what ammo does without having to use a stupid chart, and infinite customization of the game like more weapons and gear!

Ban me, like you banned me on discord :)"
,Russian government ahh behaviour
DirectionExcellent12,They can‚Äôt if you don‚Äôt violate TOS
Volomon,They can write whatever they want that doesn't trump actual laws.  They might think they can and it will happen but legally they can't.  In fact abusing the DMCA is not allowed on youtube (even though they do it way too often).
Shadowraiden,"i mean people knew this a few years ago.

thing is you can easily combat it.. US fairuse law allows you to fight this

&#x200B;

also most game developers have similar stuff in their EULA."
not1fuk,"Fails to ban legit cheaters, goes hard on people using a single player mod that doesnt negatively effect anyone else. Great priorities."
Watermelondrea69,"BSG's community manager regularly reaches out to large and small youtubers and threatens copyright strikes or even legal action over videos that exposes their problems, especially anything regarding hacking. 

BSG runs their game like a mob, which is completely unsurprising considering they are Russian. Totally unprofessional and childish."
Bobbydylan1981,No one remembered Eroktik.  The OG streamer being banned for saying things EFT didn't like.
TheCons,"You made a video using SPTarkov.
  
Don't be a little drama slut and pretend there is some deeper level to this when you uploaded footage from an illegal version of EFT. Contrary to popular belief, breaking their ToS does actually allow a copyright holder to take certain actions, such as taking a video down. There is no ""uwu they don't like me"" aspect at play, grow up.
  
But congrats, you've added one more steamer onto the compost heap that this community has become as the thread is full of kids who made up their mind as soon as they heard ""bsgbad.exe"". You conveniently leave out the fact that your video ([channel here btw](https://www.youtube.com/@AisicsOK) for anyone curious, linked in OP's profile) uses an illegal copy of the game. Go play something else."
Kortiah,"I get the drama, and why he's mad at BSG because apparently they sent strikes for way less, but he makes it sound like he did a video where he says ""I don't like EFT"", when he made a video promoting a mod engine that's very close to a cheating engine and can have serious implications on the game?

Sounds like this stuff could have been very close to a cheating engine or used to datamine stuff like %spawn of items, help develop new cheats or heavily advantageous shit. Looks like it wasn't just ""play EFT solo"" kind of stuff."
CoreSchneider,"Most, if not all companies have this in their ToS. BSG abusing it is bull shit, but a lot of multiplayer games have this in their ToS and can use it at any time. An example of this is DMBrandon, an infamous former Smite creator. Hirez revoked his right to make content with their game."

sktwocan,"This is fucking brutal, makes me glad I play Tarkov less and less"
necroweaver21,Im never buying this game....i want to play it but ill be damned if im giving bsg money
Elevekey,Pretty much any game can do this...
Kilo-Nein,"The best part is them copyright striking people while blatantly using manufacturers names and products.

Manufacturers that anyone in the gun community knows would NOT be OK with their named product being in."
NammiSjoppan,Never forget what happened to eroktik
kekbab,"this isn't the first and it won't be the last time BSG takes down footage of the version that shan't be named. it really is a shame though, they could learn a thing or two from some of the things that were made for that version of the game (the one that does not exist)"
Sad_Purple_8555,Every single game developer ever has the same right for any of their content being used on youtube. Even call of duty or mario games. They just allow it cause its good press. So thats not something new. Devs abusing it has also happend before with early acces games. It sucks but they are eventually within their right to do so
TheKappaOverlord,"I mean, the irony isn't lost on a lot of people. 

BSG is well known for IP theft and completely ignoring copyright when it comes to 99.9% of guns and attachments in their games. They use accurate gun scans, copyrighted insignias, trademarks and all and frequently ignore legal requests to cease. 

The only time in memory that they actually listened to a cease and desist was when glock issued it. And thats probably because glock has a very aggressive copyright enforcement team, and BSG's current money laundering operation would probably get exposed if they were taken into court."
voogle951,"Y‚Äôall seriously need to stop supporting this ass shit company lol, it‚Äôs embarrassing. They are willingly and purposefully allowing the average player‚Äôs experience within the game to be awful just to make money in the short term."
LoadinDirt,They apparently don't want people digging threw their code. Just because you can doesn't mean you should
SeparateAddress9070,The video you linked is someone who got a copyright strike for showing footage of a mod that breaks the games terms of service. I don't see any reason why he shouldn't have been striked.
Nanta18,Isn't it a case for all games that if they wanted  to take down youtube videos they could but nobody does it because its good publicity when your game is visible in youtube.
Positive_Insurance_5,"They can and will, unless you‚Äôre clearly hacking in your video. Then they leave it up. Don‚Äôt bash BSG or the game in your video nonstop or it‚Äôll get taken down. Kinda backwards IMO"
88mmbeast,SKRA
armrha,"I don't know if I'd call it abuse. It's their product, they reasonably do have a copyright on the content. It's completely up to them whether to allow it or not, so what motivation do they have to allow content they don't think it useful to promoting the game?"
thehadgehawg,That's literally standard in every game.
PussyYoda,Every game has this in the eula and exercise it randomly as well. Chill tf out. You aren't owed anything by bsg.
fic-flix,"I mean it's not uncommon for game companies to have that in there EULA. 

Rockstar games copyright striked tones of people making ""GTA 5 cutscene movies"" when 5 launched. 

More power to em I'd say."
majorbeefy130130,Was a yt channel that showed the old gamma glitch and out of bounds on interchange BSG struck them down which I understand. This isn't a new tactic Nintendo been doing it to people for years
DeaDlyxPowErR,But like every company can and does this? Why the hatev
Rootorii,"Every game company have EULA like this, that's pretty normal.  
They'd be stupid to not have one."
MaorCohen12,I would love to watch your video if you posted it anywhere
FailingAtExisting92,pretty sure it says in their terms that you are not allowed to modify the game files. bsg is shady af though
wardearth13,Just sounds like good business practices to me. Anyone looking to make $ would do the same.
bufandatl,If you check EULA of any game there will be something similar in it as publishers have the copyright to all that they sell they can do it. They just don‚Äôt because it‚Äôs free marketing. And it‚Äôs not really abuse of the copyright system to strike for copyright infringement. It‚Äôs just an ass move doing it this selective.
vunacar,A lot of companies do this including some of the big guys like Nintendo. It is nothing new.
AllYouNeedIsLove69,Welcome to russia my friend. Thats how it works. You shut up and be fine or you will not be fine.
AbsolutZer0_v2,"I hate to break it to you, but EVERY GAME has this EULA language"
LoLingSoHard,hahaha what a fucking loser
lauantai21,"In past games were I had been involved bit more deeply, there usually is a ""core"" group of players helping/providing feedback / do annoying repeating jobs like watching thousands of replays of cheaters, scout for articles covering the game, scout youtube for ""bad"" content (cheating videos, rmt selling ), etc.. etc....... for free.

Often these groups have access to secret power called google forms and the person who is  responsible to double check so no bad reports are passed, has just said fck it and skipped the checking part.

\- NO IDEA DOES BSG DO THIS - (and if they do, its most likely inside the russian community and players involved cant speak due to NDAs)

You could pass this to your regions community manager (dm) and ask him if he could check it with bsg. ( most likely they have direct link to person responsible for Youtube striking)

Do you have non public link only to your video? pass it on dm if possible, I could watch it and see if there is any logical reason?"
