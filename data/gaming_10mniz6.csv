Johnny Silverhand vs Joe Aluminumarm"
Andro451,"Well, to be fair, it is Keanu reeves on the left."
snagglewolf,"Despite his confidence I love how Chai is a total bozo and both the game and the other characters treat him like one. He gets his kick ass moments of looking like a badass, and he also gets the crap kicked out of him on a regular basis."
77skull,Reddit discovers the term rizz

ExitMusic_,"I don’t even know if Hi-Fi rush is an “objectively good” game or not because I’m having so much fucking fun with it and vibing with the music. 

Where did this thing come from it just kinda popped into my feed out of no where."
NameIsZ,"Probably my age showing, but who's the one on the right?"
mheinken,Chai gets pussy too

EpicForgetfulness,But one of them is *Keanu Reeves*
Zealousideal_Car_532,Only difference is at least hifi’s game was actually finished
,[deleted]

Rattkjakkapong,What the fuck is rizz?
Runecat06,What game is the guy on the right from ??
SublimeEcto1A,Someone put Chris D’elia in a game?
Maplicious2017,"Bro, I don't know who you think you are but Chai fucks.

He may be a dunce sometimes, but that's part of the charm."
Christank1,"I fear I may be ""getting old"" as they say, but I gotta ask anyways. What does 'rizz' mean?"
thecowley,Who's the guy on the right
josenight,"Ignoring obvious troll account lol, this game has been universally liked. Hope we see more especially in that art style.

Edit: the “ignoring obvious troll account” is because when I left this comment there was only 1 other comment and it was some dude baiting and hating on the game. He was calling anyone who likes this type of game a sped and other things."

theone2Stepp,Silverhand wins easily
brobalwarming,I guess im in the minority but rizz is solid slang

sirfannypack,Why is the term “rizz” a thing?
Trell3k,Well im officially old. I hate the words drip and rizz. Hopefully they accept me at the local seniors centre.
Belgand,"Can we finally start putting game titles in the title? Like, am I supposed to recognize that guy on the right? Let me guess, he's in something that came out a week ago and all the people who are part of the hype train assume that everyone else lives in the same tiny bubble they do."
LookAtThisDuuudee,stop saying that cringe word
DestGades,Just remember Bethesda mad hifi rush. This game is a treat. I can't say enough about it. I'm playing it on gard and getting whooped in a fun way lol
BurnieTheBrony,The astroturfing advertisement campaign for this game is taking over this sub and it's annoying.
