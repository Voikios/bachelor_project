{"Title": "Resolving the breaching debate: a suggestion.", "Post Text": "Add locked doors to the cockpit areas of all ships other than rustbucket in order to partition the cockpit off from the rest of ship.  Under normal circumstances, these doors require the pilot's keycard to open but can be disabled in two separate ways:\n\n1. Locks are disabled when the ship is disabled\n2. Locks can be disabled with a blowtorch like vault doors\n\nThis greatly rewards players for using a better ship and makes winning space combat meaningful in a way that I think is logical (disable the ship to access the otherwise hardened areas).  At the same time, it still allows players to breach a functional ship for pvp and plunder ( the stash might be used in raid if more people were in ships that had them, raiding it and getting out might become a strategy) however a blowtorch is required to actually break into the cockpit if the ship is not disabled.  I hope both sides of this debate will think through the various implications of this potential change and add their thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit:  Another way to implement this would be to simply tie the door's locked status to the status of the engines and allow blowtorches to damage engines inside the ship, but I think it's more dramatic to torch open the door and face a hail of gunfire.
