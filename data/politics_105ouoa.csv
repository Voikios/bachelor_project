Anonymous_user_2022,"In Denmark a non.compete clause require the employer to pay salary for as long as the clause runs. It tend to limit the use to those few key persons, where there are genuine concerns."
AlertThinker,The only non-compete that should exist is a five year ban on allowing a politician to go work for a lobbying firm.

Plow_King,"i worked 15 yrs in feature film VFX and these were common at most studios. but i always laughed them off because i knew it was unenforceable, and i never heard of an employee getting in trouble over it.

turns out i was only right about that while in CA, where i did most my work. it should be nationwode."
Chi-Guy86,"Lina Khan is low key one of the best picks Biden has made to head a government agency or commission.  She’s incredibly smart and on the right side of most issues when it comes to monopolies and unfair business practices.  

This is a great change.  However, we all know our corporately captured judiciary, especially SCOTUS, will be itching to earn their keep and invalidate this rule

> The FTC will likely face legal challenges, including on whether it even has the power to regulate noncompete agreements. The agency says the proposed rule is based on a preliminary finding that noncompetes constitute an unfair method of competition and therefore are a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act."
SpaceCadet2000,"The way it works in my country (Belgium) is:

* The non-compete agreement must be geographically limited
* The non-compete agreement must be limited in time to at most 12 months
* The non-compete agreement must be limited in scope to actually competitive activities. The burden of proof for this lies on the employer, and courts tend to side with the employee. For example: a salesman who is actively poaching customers from his previous employer would probably be covered, but a programmer who is going to do similar programmer type things at another company would not be.
* The employer also has to actively decide to enforce the non-compete at the end of the contract and inform the employee.
* If the employer decides to enforce the non-compete, he is obligated to pay the employee fair compensation for the duration of the non-compete (usually this is +- the employee's wages for that period), regardless of the employment status of the former employee.

In practice, non-compete agreements are almost never enforced."
was_and_wasnt,"we should be able to compete wherever we want.  If a business can't compete, why do we need that business?"
basb9191,"Here's my issue. All these companies want to pay starvation wages and then not allow overtime, but then also demand you not have a second job in the same field. If they don't allow overtime, my ""specialty"" is related specifically to that field, and I can't go work for a ""competitor"" on the side, how the hell am I supposed to make enough money? Noncompete needs to die."
fattymccheese,"Or …  require non-competes to pay salary during term … that seems reasonable

Company gets value of not losing critical - time value with information that ex employee has as a privilege of their previous employment

Ex employee has income to rely on while building new non-competitive book of business or move rolls based on skill not on privileged info"
Moleday1023,"I am an at Will employee, so why should my employer be able to restrict me after either of us has exercised “at will”.  Currently they can treat me like shit and underpay me, I can’t get another job in my chosen field for minimally one year.  Does this sound like indentured servitude?  If you quit, your family starves, so shut the fuck up!   I hope Biden and the Democrats are successful.  Now the rich control the House of Representatives, it might be difficult."

MiyamotoKnows,"I've been hearing annually that they will be banned for 20 years. If I stated how much these have cost me in my life by locking me in I would be called a liar. You literally get locked into a company (and the companies aee very aware). I know many people who have had to choose between staying at a company, for in many cases decades at whatever comp you can scratch out, or choose to leave your industry and start over in another, which no one can do with a mortgage and family. They never should have been allowed in the first place. 99% of people under them hold zero trade secrets."

catanddogtor,"I'm a veterinarian.. non-competes are standard. It sucks. If you're doing a residency, a 250 mile non-compete is common. It forces you to uproot your life over and over, especially if you're working somewhere that treats you like shit. But if you've bought a house and have a family, it's hard to pick up and leave."

,Non compete clauses and health insurance are the two big hammers corporate America uses to keep their employees in line.
SnooChickens2093,"I had a non-compete at my previous job and it ended up benefiting me. One day my boss walked into my office and fired me without cause, perhaps forgetting we had a signed non-compete when I started almost 5 years earlier. So, they had to pay me my full salary for 6 months, plus gross-up’d Cobra. Ostensibly it was to prevent me from going to work for their competition, but the truth was I was tired of the industry and was already looking for a way out anyway. So, I went back to school and finished up my degree and enjoyed a few months of paid vacation before finding work I actually enjoyed."
ame-foto,"I had to sign a non-compete saying I wasn't allowed to do portrait photography in the the county I lived in, plus the three surrounding counties for two years after leaving the company. Photography is literally my trade. It was the stupidest non-compete ever. Honestly I broke it because I needed to make money and was ready to fight it court because it was too broad. I worked for a different studio previously that their non-compete was just ""don't steal our clients"" which is pretty easy to follow and fair. They don't want you to use their studio to gain your own client base."
IWantAKitty,"I was subject to a non compete at my last job and got an offer from a direct competitor. It was a 30% pay raise and full time wfh for the exact same job. Once i found out I had a non compete and told new potential employer, they  had their lawyers review and told me they couldn’t proceed with me (keep in mind I was just a manager). I hated my company and needed to get out so I asked to be released from my non compete which they refused to do. I ended up completely leaving the industry for a new role because of this and am still incredibly salty about it."
Cristal1337,"In the year that I studied to become a translator, we learned about how the translation industry works. One of the things that got me angry, was the fact that your employer can bar you from working with ""their"" clients after you quit or get fired. So in practice: 

1. Starting as a translator, you need experience before you can become independent. So you start off, working at a translation agency.
1. There is a list of clients you help establish and maintain. Client retention is based on your performance. 
1. You get fired or quit.
1. You are not allowed to accept jobs from any of the clients the agency has done business with for at least 5 to 10 years. 
1. Since this ruins your ability to become independent, you start working at a different translation agency. 

The worst part is that the teachers and professors at the translation academy simply didn't get why this was bad...basically saying: ""but what about the profits of the agency?"""
ChaosKodiak,Need to do this with arbitration agreements too.
soliddeuce,Huge deal for pro wrestling. WWE loves enforcing noncompetes on wrestlers they fire.
Second-Ancient,Back in 2002 Jimmy John’s made me sign something saying I would never work for another place that made sandwiches ever again in my life.
1hero_no_cape,"I once had a former employer try to con me into signing a non-compete/NDA in my EXIT interview. 

It was hilarious, watching them try to force me into signing it. I was even told that not signing it would impact my receiving my final paycheck. 

I went to the WI DLR website, showed them where trying to skip my final check would cost them up to triple in court. 

Whaddia know? I got my final check! They snail-mailed it in place of direct deposit but I received it. 

Turns out, NDA's and NC's are not enforceable without money tied to them. Even if I had signed it, there was no power behind it."
I_Framed_OJ,"Non Competes are designed to keep salaries low, with the secondary goal of stifling any competition.  I am fairly certain that they are not legally enforceable in most states, but that’s not the point.  Employers have the resources to actually go to court, even when they’re going to lose.  Most employees cannot afford the time off and legal fees required to fight it out.  So they’re intimidated into not seeking work elsewhere for better pay and benefits.  So while they aren’t legal, they absolutely need to be banned, with massive, massive fines for companies who try to force their workers to sign them."
death_face,I'm basically prevented from taking another job in my industry anywhere in the country for a year unless I want to roll the dice on a legal battle over my theoretically unenforceable non compete. The best part? They can fire me for any reason and still enforce it.
willyolio,"Imagine, companies actually rewarding employees so that they aren't tempted to work for the competitor, instead of threatening them

nah let's just keep paying them less and less, then sue them when they look for another job"
Matrix17,"One of the reasons I didn't move to MA over CA. They're unenforceable in CA. In MA, every employee in my industry is asked to sign one. I was offered a job and they wanted me to sign what I would consider an executive level non-compete. For an entry level role. I told her I'm not signing that and they could go pound sand

They only offered me $65,000 in Cambridge for that shit. Ridiculous"
verbatum213,Ban arbitration agreements too!
HowGreatAreYourDanes,"Per my employment contract, I owe my employer a considerable amount if they fire me with or without cause in the first 18 months. That should be illegal."
Zoraji,"I have made this comment before when this topic has came up. 

This has prevented me more than once from getting a better paying job. I did great on the interview only to be told later we can't hire you because you work for X. I found out that the company I worked for was willing to let me go but wanted the new employer to pay them $25K to waive the noncompete.  

It is even worse in a smaller market. It was basically a one-industry town and everyone provided support to that industry so once you started working for one company it was impossible to get a job with another in the area."
MysticSmear,"When I worked for McDonald’s years ago a new owner took over and they asked me to sign a noncompete agreement that I wouldn’t work for other fast food restaurants. I wasn’t even working for another company but I refused to sign it. 

When they asked me why I said “why should I commit to a company that refuses to let people work full time to prevent paying them over time?” 


They didn’t make me sign it. I quit 2 months after that when my hours were cut."
mskmslmsct00l,"As a dentist this it is industry standard to not only have a noncompete that includes large portions of metropolitan areas or even counties. Not only that but we are often forbidden from hiring fellow employees for 2 years which means my contract forbids the employment freedom of many other people. It's the most un-American, anti-free market thing ever."
Sage2050,"They mostly don't hold up in court anyway, it's just for intimidating employees into not leaving"
squidmanwillie,I can finally quit my job at jimmy John’s and go work at the subway across the street
Human_Urine,"Good. Fuck these illegal, unenforceable contracts employees get forced into signing anyway. I had to sign one in an old job and I broke the terms when I moved on and worked for myself. If I'm thinking like an economist however, this will cause job turnovers to increase in the labor market, which should be bad for productivity, and good for wage growth. Both of these factors are inflationary. Just a thought."
Life_Mycologist_7215,I started a biotech company in Massachusetts and had to leave the industry entirely because of the noncompete I signed and I had to leave the PhD program I was in. I’m not some kind of genius who would have saved humanity but the fact that companies can use these as threats against a regular person without recourse has certainly cost us all something as a society.
SerenityNow312,I’m a doctor and once signed a contract with a 30 mile radius non compete. It was a good gig but holy shit if I wanted to move across town I couldn’t. As someone else said in another comment I’d have to move my whole family to another city or state. Currently I’m on a 10 mile non compete which is honestly not much better. So absurd.
Paidorgy,"99% of non-compete clauses aren’t worth the paper they’re written on, because the employer isn’t going to enforce it. 

Worked at a franchise in six different locations, moved to a shop across from one of those locations, and the area manager tried to threaten me with legal action. I asked them to do what they need to do, and I didn’t hear back from them after that."
esoteric_enigma,"I dated a girl who is a mental health therapist. She had a non-compete that prevents her from working in anything therapy related in a 30 mile radius for 8 months. 

She was offered a higher paying job that she couldn't take because of this. How is that capitalism? It literally stops companies from having to compete for workers because they're trapped once they get them."

BlueMANAHat,"My fiance had just earned her NMLS and was set to start making bank as a loan officer. The owners brother sexually harrassed her, she reported it, and he fired her a week later. We are suing and it is going to trial due to him refusing to settle or even get a lawyer... It happened last Feburary and we are about 2 years away from court according to her lawyer.

She has a non compete from this job which she has to honor even though we are suing. This forced her to take a bullshit job that only pays half her portion of the bills, I'm stuck with the rest...

The non compete ends in Feb thank God but it's been such a burden

So when someone tells you to sue someone or contact an attorney as if you can fix all your problems understand it's going to add to your problems for awhile. Suing someone is literally like a part time job."
,Non-compete agreements should be illegal
heapinhelpin1979,"Bosses: People don’t want to work anymore.
Also bosses: once you work for me you can’t leave or I’ll sue. 

Seriously signing non-compete contracts is a way to curtail growth for the employee and the economy. 

I absolutely hate them."
Geeky435,So many of the arguments against non compete agreements also apply to health care. People would be more able to switch jobs or take the risk of starting a new business if their healthcare wasn't tied to their employer. Everything about our current system is in favor of corporate profit and against the interests of the workers.
huhzonked,This would be great news. Non compete clauses are pretty common in the rehab/therapy in nursing homes.
ramblershambler,"When I worked in local TV news noncompetes were in every contract and everyone was under contract - including the anchors, reporters, producers and photogs. The local TV stations were acting like a cartel to suppress wages. You'd be shocked to see how little TV reporters are paid - which is why so many of them are lame."
AAArdvaarkansastraat,"I own a growing small business. We train our employees and give them the chance to train us in that hopefully they improve on the parameters of the job. So a non-compete ban would mean that after an employee is up to speed, I have to treat them right? Oh no!!!!! :-)
Look, you have an 112 non-sleeping hours in a week. About 1/3 of those are spent at work. Pay folks enough, show them that if the company grows they grow as well, and give them joy during their time with you. If you do these challenging things, you're pitching in, they're pitching in, and they'll WANT to be with you. Non-competes for the working man (I'm not being sexist; I'm just very old school), are bullshit. They're like a lash across the back. You don't treat people like that."
k_woodard,What a shame… imagine banning millions of workers. So sad.
FuriousFreddie,Most non-compete agreements are already banned in California and I believe it was recently banned in Washington State too.
TastyCartographer630,I recently had an interview for a recruiter position because I hate the company im recruiting for now. Interview went great until the very end they asked if I would be comfortable signing a no compete clause that would keep me from recruiting for any other company within 50 miles of the location of this one for 2 years. I told them they were out of their fucking minds asking people to sign something like that. No wonder I’ve seen that position on indeed for months now
cal_mofo,I had a conversation in an ethics class about these clauses. The amount of people defending them was crazy.
BuyDizzy8759,"Haha, the last place I worked gave us a packet of things to sign when hired. One of them was the anti-postit contract (if you are working here and invent something that makes you millions, that money is ours...like the guy that invented post-it notes did).
I threw it away and signed the rest. Nothing ever came of it, but I spent a lot of time trying to invent things with company property."
ButterscotchLow8950,"All this will do is create a new monetized “Non-compete” just like a non-disclosure after the fact. They can still do it, but they are going to have to fucking pay your ass to stay away from their competitors. 

Fucking exit bonus. I like it 🤣✌️"
bowlbasaurus,Non-competes are just slavery. Corporations don’t own people and what is in their minds. It is kinda crazy that they have around in the Us for so long.
WhaleFactory,"I operate a small manufacturing company, and was set to hire someone who had a number of years of experience in trade work. I was going to pay him more, and be closer to his home. I had asked him to check with his current employer to see if he had any non-competes and turns out he did and didn't even know it.   


They had him sign it as part of an annual pay raise - in my state there needs to be ""compensation"" to make them valid. His freedom has absolutely been diminished, and it is still enforceable even if they fire him. The document was 7 pages long, I immediately wrote to all my representatives about this, and am thrilled to see this happening.  


I simply do not sign people to non-competes on principal. Even sales people. I feel it is incumbent upon me as an employer to compete to keep my employees as well as my customers.  I understand the inclination to do it, as it makes it easy to retain people and not pay them appropriately, which is why it should be banned."
red_purple_red,The wins just keep coming in for Biden
CSMom74,"I refused to sign one before because I was already there two years and then suddenly they spring that on everyone one day. I wouldn't have worked there if they had. I told that that was not the arrangement when they hired me, and unless I got a significant raise, if I feel like I need to work elsewhere to support my family, I will.

They didn't push me to sign it."
daedalis2020,"There’s a difference to me between non compete and non solicit. You want to start your own company fine, but you can’t use the knowledge you gained of my customers, pricing, etc. to steal my workers and customers for at least a year or two.

Otherwise you’d have shady employees joining companies just to get customer lists and such."
ScarySuit,Good!
DoctorPath,"Colorado doesn’t have noncompete agreements by law, we just pay huge financial penalties if we do so, work around for everything, even if not enforceable."
red4jjdrums5,"I’m glad this is going to pass. One of my previous jobs was like this. Noncompete, and you had to sign an agreement not to speak of the company in a bad light during employment and for 1 year after leaving. No wonder we only heard good things about them. They got bought out not long ago, and the new owners were shocked that it was like walking into a funeral with how sombre the employees were. Hopefully things got straightened out."
Trashymath,"I have worked in spas and salons for the last ten years, and it is wild how many places have aggressive noncompetes. I worked at a medical spa that had a non compete that you could not work within a 6mi radius of the spa for 3 years. The owner would obsessively stalk ex employees on social media happy to start legal action against anyone who broke the contract."
reddit-sucks-ass_,This hurt me for two years. Straight out of my first job out of college. They’d have enforced it too. If they caught me.
Athabascad,would this include non compete clauses for stock options? It appears to me that this covers non competes for employment
BeerMania,"A good thing that needs pushed through but who knows if It can hold weight considering the clown show of the supreme court & the republican lead congress.  My father was sued for a non-compete for a delivery business. Imagine start-ups across the country that get absolutely decimated by courts before they can even get off the ground.

&#x200B;

While you are at it, perhaps some other government agencies, IRS cough, can fix the tax code! Just send me a letter of what I owe like every other country on earth! Ridiculous."
Coranthius,"Media member here, I approve. Many people that want to move across town or area to another station get stuck waiting for it expire, or are forced to buy out."
Pr1ebe,I thought most non competes didnt hold up in court anyway
,"When I was looking for a job a few years back, I was offered a midling salary with, if deciding not to renew, no work for 1 year then three years not able to take a job within 50 miles of the primary work location.

I did not take that job."
Gromit83,My country basically made companies pay the salary for the non-compete time to the employee if he traded to a company affected by it. That cut that down drastically (also maxed the time to 1 year)
Jackieirish,Cool. Now get rid of arbitration.
Yung_Jose_Space,Good.
CantTrips,This is going to rattle the design field if so. I've had every single job make me sign a noncompete to be able to work.
VindictivePrune,Most courts don't uphold non-competes to begin with
Miserable_Unusual_98,I had a 4 month ban working on the same sector when my previous employer didn't renew my contract. I requested specifically if he meant the company that hired him to do a specific job and i got back some bullshit reasoning without elaboration. I did think it was bullshit clause.
TheKingOfDub,I just never signed any employment contract. After a few days HR always just let it slide
marley1012,Why are we banning workers? Seems like that would be a bigger burden on society than just eliminating noncompete agreements.
Bouric87,"I don't see any reason an employee should have a non compete.  

The only situation is could see it being legitimately used is when you buy a business.  Like if I buy your bakery I could see wanting part of the sale stipulation being that the old owner can't just open a new bakery next door and emailing all his customers that he's starting a new bakery"
stroker919,They will just come up with some other bullshit.
HopefullyMD_PhD,Just another fake rule the US will implement just for companies to break and not get punished.
haemaker,"I am from California and what is this?

(Non-competes have been banned  in California except for some very narrow circumstances for decades)."
Vienta1988,"Wow, this is awesome! Employers just use these to keep people stuck in shitty jobs."
bslaytoday,"In most cases non-competes only limits the ability for the person to steal clients and company information to use against them for a period of time.  They don’t limit you from doing your job and making money.  In the state of TX they don’t/won’t enforce an NCA that limits people from doing their trade/career to make money.  They should definitely limit the scope of them though, some companies in tight, competitive industries like to make them as binding as possible so they can scare people."
Ttownzfinest,"I have a 5 year non-compete. I was young and dumb when I signed it. In fact a couple years ago my company realized an entire Business Unit of ours never signed a non-compete. They called them into a meeting and the team memebers had 2 choices: Sign a non-compete or turn in their resignation for a severance. We lost some good people that day, all of whom are thriving in thier careers now….. mostly at competitors lol."
shorttompkins,"I recently worked at a place for over 3 years that I never had any intention of ever leaving. Then a merger and acquisition happened and it became a total disaster, shit-show, toxic environment in literally the span of 3 months. Everyone left and it was so depressing.  The worst part was that we spent the last 3 years doing something very few people have and did it well.  We individually built a strong set of skills and industry knowledge.  Competitors found out and wanted us, and wanted us badly.  The salary ranges being thrown around were insane.  And I had to go through hell to get out of my non-compete (staying 3 months longer than I would have normally if I could have just given 2 weeks notice).  On top of that others weren't so lucky and since so many people were leaving they decided to just blanket stop letting people out of their non-competes - even if they were willing to negotiate longer terms.

The sad part was that our non-compete was for 6 months, so some people left with little notice and took a long vacation before starting at a competitor.  The company, however, wasn't even willing to work with people to let them goto a competitor if they stayed for 6 months with the org.  Think about that - they would rather lose you, and fuck you over, knowing full well you're going to goto the competitor anyway, than keep you for 6 months and at least retain some of your skillset for that long."
snowbirdnerd,"Good, it's fucking absurd that a company can dictate where you can work after you leave them."
Meatslinger,"Force the capitalists to play by their own rules. If they can’t afford my work, then some other company gets it instead. They shouldn’t be allowed to set rules on who I can jump ship for, otherwise that would be *”””socialism”””* or something like that.

If they have the best company, they deserve the best workers. If not, then they deserve to fail. It’s the capitalist way - unfiltered survival of the fittest - and I’ll gladly hold them to it."
HnMike,"I fully support the abolition of non-compete agreements for all but highly compensated employees with access to information that is genuinely a trade secret. But it should be done by an act of Congress not an agency run by unelected officials. This trend to make a run around Congress using Executive Agencies, like in the student debt forgiveness move, is for me very worrisome."
Etherius,"How about banning closed shops on union contracts?

They’re already illegal.  Just need to actually enforce it"
WAMIV,"In MA they're required to pay 50% of your highest salary to enforce it (https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXI/Chapter149/Section24L#:~:text=A%20noncompetition%20agreement%20may%20be,non%2Ddisclosure%20or%20confidentiality%20agreement. See part vii)

WhaleFactory,"Non-competes are pretty much just legalized modern day slavery. Once you sign one, the business you work for owns you."
Richandler,"""In a good economy business competes for people. There is a shortage of people to work for business. Everybody wants to hire you. They'll train you, whatever it takes.
