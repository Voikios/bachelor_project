_Nightdude_,"I love Lighthouse

If it ain't the cheaters that get ya, it's a random ass mine or a rogue with a GL three maps away"
OrgeMakez,"Talking about lighthouse, how the hell do you guys survive to the water treatment plan as BEAR? Rogues keep sniping me literally the second i poke my head from any corner/rock 400m away from the place and i have to do the ""corporate secrets"" task"
Cpt_plainguy,I watched you turn 180Â° and I instantly knew what was about to happen
Kooky-Scallion7896,Mines have been so random for me in Lighthouse. Sometimes I have a PACA on and can take 2 mines and survive. Other times im fully geared level 5 armor and good helmet and the first mine kills me lol
merlindanny,Perfectly cut!
MemeOps,"I've found so many ways of dying on this map, i should be subjected to some form of clinical study. The map is just a linear death funnel."
Erdnuss-117,The mines on lighthouse suck so hard
keel_yourself,I had that happen earlier. Got both documents and unlocked the door to the studio to realize I forgot a jammer. Run out to extract hit a mine. Walk backwards maybe 5 steps and get fuckin sniped. Time to try again for the 14th time :)
PureRushPwneD,"I'm surprised you survived, my friend went sky high yesterday from walking onto one"
proximy,"As soon as you started sprinting I said ""oh no"""
Bobbybrown2116,"Wait, since when do the mines show as red on the ground?"
