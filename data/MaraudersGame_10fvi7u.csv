HHgameking115,"So I just hit prestige, played one raid and my inventory resets to what it was before.
Traider lvls also back to what it was.
I was kind of looking forward to fighting my way up from nothing again but I'm definitely not going to complainü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
frankie_doom,"it reset my stash and money first prestige but kept trader levels, second prestige actually did what it was intended to do and reset my stash, money and trader levels lol i really really hope the devs get onto this soon as the game is a bit of a mess with ZTH being bugged from the start and even the update/wipe didn't change that

this game is a real gem though! i've been waiting SEVENTY YEARS for something like this!"
Maybedeadbynow,"Wait waaaaaaaat?! This game is bugged af right now. Hopefully next patch will wipe everybody to 0 again and will fix all the ui and crash issues...and traders, obviously :/"
IRLSinisteR,"Yikes, guess they need to bug fix that."
RandomGuyOverYonder,Why not just discard everything.
Pawing_sloth,"Out of curiosity, why were you saving jewelry boxes? I always break them down. Is there something I'm missing?"
wizardjian,"Something similar happened to me the night before. Not in prestige, but just normal gameplay. I took a armor in for a friend and dropped it for him. Did a raid, came out, the armor is in my storage again. All the stuff I carried out got reverted to what I had when I went in. 

So now I have 3 of the same armor and none of the warbonds I found .-."
lankmastertay,"Basically there's a bug where if you don't look at your inventory, go directly into a raid, and come back out, your stash will stay and not be triggered as a prestige wipe. I've seen exploits of it but it's probably be sniffed out in the next patch. Lots to fix though so who knows"
OccasionalJoint,I‚Äôm so surprised that people actually play this shit still lmao
