TrueNorthStrong1898,I love how you made your factory look like the item you’re producing lmao
icydee,"But, you need a sign in the factory to identify what it produces…"
LbaB,"It's my first large build, not much to look at but definitely fun to do. It's following [these stats](https://u6.satisfactorytools.com/production?share=b4u8T7NsZRvfu2fSqxZJ), the cube is 40**3 tiles in size."
Fast_Mag,And how much of each item is needed for that? Ahaha
Oldenodd,"This is superb!

Nuclear pasta gonna be fun. Please keep us posted."
blackscorpion93,This is awesome

wivaca,Can't wait to see your nuclear pasta factory.
hammonjj,Sweet mother of God
Wallbreaker93,Me on my way building a massive RCU to build RCUs
Royalportal,"Bloody hell man, why? I love it though lol"
masterown35,How many hours did it take? Lol
loughtthenot,You son of a bitch Im in
Chronien,Question: why
mikegoblin,I’ve never made a build this big. Bringing in over 9000 coal per minute seems very daunting like— is that every node in the game?
samsa-_-blam,That shit is heavy
Next-Jelly3720,"Shoot I should upload a screen shot of mine, I basically did the same thing but all production is shoved into the black bits lol"
TheEpicBoss95,How do you evenly distribute so much product from one stage of production to another? I'm a little intimidated when the factory I want needs multiple types of items moved at a rate that exceeds the 780/min throughput limit of mk. 5 belts.
LearningToBee,How bad is the lag?
