Lord0fHats,Especially after Forward Unto Dawn was pretty solid and provided a model for how to make a good Halo series on a budget that wouldn't blow anyone's mind.
fallynangell,This is what happens when a director says I WONT read any source material
stabTHAtornado,"When ever I saw Chief pickup the same chaingun that the insurgency was using against the elits and was doing fuck all, but when He picks it up  it completely overloaded the shields with like 2 shots and chews them up with it,   I knew that they didn't care about what they was doing."
GipsyRonin,"I had hope in HBO and they delivered. The music, sounds, acting, casting, scenes that were huge were faithfully recreated. 

I smiled when we were in the back seat driving out of town. And teared up when you know…the aftermath of that. Pedro made me feel his pain."
clydefrog811,That’s HBO vs Paramount+
Calm_Rub6617,"Imagine if the halo show was about much of soldier doing idiotic things and clowning around like me and
My friend in halo."
Someguy098_,"When Bungie makes Commercials (that are 10+ years old) better than a TV series you know something's wrong. I seriously don't think there's been any Halo media (other than the games and books) that quite encompasses the feel of War like how those commercials do. 

The fact that not only has this shit happened to Halo but multiple other popular series (Star Wars, Witcher, etc.) is sickening. These asshole directors who think they know better and who won't even *glance* at the source material due to their inflated ego need to stop being hired. If they aren't going to faithfully adapt a series then they don't deserve their jobs."
matej86,It's what happens when one of the writers (Neil Drukmann) for the show is the co-president of Naughty Dog as well as writer and creative director of the first game. Another writer (Craig Mazzin) worked on Chernobyl as well.
ecoupon,My name is John and I take off my helmet any chance I can.
Pen_dragons_pizza,I think a major thing the show fucked up was the music. You have some of the most iconic themes in gaming history yet choose not to use them and when they did for w few seconds it was a weird ass remixed version.
limelight022,"I never watched the Halo series, but when i read Master Chief took off his helmet I knew right there that i would never watch the show at all."
CiriLOVESGeralt,Halo had a TV Series?
Azmodieus,"The Last of Show gave me the same feeling as if I was playing the game. I could remember the time and place when I first played the game. It was truely reintroducing the same emotions I felt in 2013. The show is great. A show should fill in the gaps a game can't, flesh out the areas where a game cant. Fuck that Halo show."
Pubdles,"Halo fans already had excellent live action stuff, which makes the show so much more of a travesty

Landfall was great

The ODST trailer was also great, both look and feel way better than the tv show

shadowdash66,Witcher fans: first time?
20mgAddy,I’m tired sir. Sierra 117 out.
AgentAtom,You’ve heard of Master Chief… but have you heard of Master Cheeks? Watch the Halo show to find out more!
aabil11,Why do we need a Halo TV series when we have Red vs Blue
General_Kenobi_117,"Sorry OP there hasn't been a halo TV show.
 
Some banger live action TV commercials, and a few films to promote 4 and 5. 

But there never has been a Halo TV show."
ZackyZack,"To be fair, TLoU is a narrative game already. Adapting it into a mainstream drama is a lot safer than Halo.

That being said, they did go overboard with Halo"
MrFluffyhead80,"Halo is my favorite franchise and I’ll be honest, I’m okay with just playing the games"
Peenork,"Who would of thought that keeping 90% of the source material in-tact **down to the exact lines** would take one of the most successful video games and also make it one of the best videogame-to-show adaptations ever made? 

Imagine if Joel randomly fell in love with a clicker halfway through the series and Ellie only showed up in the finale of season 1 lmao"
EggcellentStew,Red VS Blue is still to this day the best series adaptation of any video games. Caboose carried the entire show too.
Lettuce_is_a_pedo,I heard they let chief take off his helmet in that shit show. Idk though i didnt watch it as i heard about the helmet thing and was like yaaa fuck no.
Metroid545,Im still wondering why the witcher had to get the asshole writers that once again think themselves above the franchise
Maelious,"the last of us show isn't over yet, it still has plenty of time to turn into a shit show. first episode was fantastic though."
Hooshfest,"I don’t get it, the tone was set back during the Halo 3 / ODST era when they made those live action “commercials”. That was how a Halo TV series should have been portrayed. You know, like a real fucking war of annihilation with combat were accustom to seeing in the games. I’m convinced the leaders in charge of halo are purposefully fucking up the franchise at this point."
w_paskee,Master- I mean John is a fucking war criminal in the show. He doesn't deserve the title of master chief.
mighty_mag,"I've played a couple of Halo games but mostly for the shooting. Didn't get much of the story. Haven't watched the TV adaptation either, so I must ask: what's wrong with the Halo TV show?

Is one of those cases where the adaptation butcher the source material, like that Resident Evil Netflix show, or is it when it's rather faithful, but it's straight up bad, like that Resident Evil movie adaptation? (RE has is all!)"
JesseElBorracho,Truly some baffling creative choices on that Halo show.
Successful-Whole4307,"Us's

Wtf???"
