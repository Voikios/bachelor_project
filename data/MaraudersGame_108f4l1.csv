ElderberryFar7120,I like the idea. Maybe it is something they could add to the better ships but not the rust bucket and give more incentive to use the better ships.
bikematbike,"I made this suggestion before, but I think the more health the ship has remaining, the more health you should lose in breaching it. Makes complete sense, too, since the hull is more intact and dangerous to get through, vs heavily damaged and easy to penetrate."
cmiller456,"Deff needs some kind of rework since pods are incredibly hard to hit and yeah if you happened to be 1 guy and 3 ppl board you suddenly youâ€™re at a disadvantage for destroying their ship, makes no sense"
nervouswhenitseasy,"if your guns are good enough, you can easily kill them before they escape. the rust bucket gun will not kill them before they reach the pods. get a 120mm howitzer and they arent escaping shit."
scared_star,"But then the leaderboard people will have to do the raid /s

I know they raid sometimes."
rykerh228,Valid
Hetairoi,"Instead they should flesh out the module system, maybe a little CWIS keeps pods at bay but you sacrifice speed / armor / whatever."
TheGhastlyBoogityBoo,"When I was still playing, I was constantly telling my friends the boarding system makes no sense. I'm preoccupied blasting the ship I've disabled and my reward is...to get breached myself. I think having 2 pods would be a better system. Escape pods that well escape, and then breach pods that can only he used while your ship is active (not shot down disabled). Either which way I agree that space combat is just not worth it."
anony8165,"Honestly, the game might need to just separate breacher pods and escape pods. Escape pods should be free and for escaping. Breacher pods should cost money."
Skerxan,Breachers actually using ships? This would be a great addition.
PriorofDeath,This is why I currently don't partake in space combat. I agree with this change
TheIronPaladin1,Or just do no pods for first 30-45 secs
Antrisa,Get good? That's the best part coaxing people to board you and kill them
NervousJ,"Armor rating making it harder to breach is a good idea. Hell, add a reactive armor that's clearly visible and blows up pods trying to breach unless the ship is disabled far enough. Or autoguns that target pods for much cheaper. Space combat is dumb right now and instabreaching is part of it."
StevenSpielgirth,Maybe breach pods and escape pods need to be separated. You can only access breach pods when your ship is intact?
starcrud,When you disable the ship the people inside will start to take damage at a set rate if you continue to fire on it. Players also take about 10% hp damage when they breach a ship. So they are at a disadvantage already if you disable them then they breach you.
Shoresy69420,"Just keep laying on their ship while strafing away, then shoot pods if you can. 

If not, AP mine all doorways and laugh."
TTV_xxero_foxx,"The amount of people on this thread who think a person's game should be over when their ship is disabled is alarming. I just don't get it. This isn't a space combat sim, it's a first person shooter. Why is everyone so afraid of gunfights that they think a pod shouldn't be able to beach their ship??

That's just not what this game is. Period. If you want to pick fights against other ships, be prepared for them to beach you. If you don't want that, don't pick fights with other ships. If that makes you think this game isn't fun, then you should probably be playing EVE or Star Citizen where the focus is primarily on ship combat."
,"There should be a quest track that allows you to permanently upgrade your rust bucket.  Think, faction specific ships would be neat.  Give us something to work for in the end game.  They can balance it by disallowing selling ships and obviously you can't scrap your default vehicle.  As is I work to build an interceptor with MA, enter navy wearing t12 helmet and panzer... get killed by SAS captain... wtf is the point,  I'll never waste time building an interceptor again..."
Thelest_OfThemAll,Doesn't the winning ship already get the advantage of pummeling the losing ship and doing health damage to the losing crew so they have to board you with less health (or less healing supplies).
METTTHEDOC,How about yes on ships that are not rustbuckets
ACESTRONAUT123,"Lol anyone complaining about this I'm willing to bet dont use good ships regularly, or are fairly new to the game and just not good at shooting down escape pods. Space combat would be boring if everytime I disabled a ship their only option is to escape out. If your using just the rust bucket, sure it is hard to shoot down escape pods but any of the better ship weapons make it fairly easy, and there is absolutely no point in breaching a disabled ship to kill people, and what would you have to loot if they podded out,"
blackyoda,Worst Idea ever
appa_the_magic_bum,Flak canon slept on
TTV_xxero_foxx,The focus of this game is primarily on gunfighting. I really don't see any point or benefit from a change like this because it would be incredibly unbalanced. It would be impossible for people in rust buckets to stand a chance against bigger ships. Beaching should remain available at any point.
Bearman71,Skill issue
Practical_Problem756,Personally I like minding my own business trying to get to a port and then someone has to come along trying blast me for fun. So it's satisfying for me to board your ship and take your life for it.
