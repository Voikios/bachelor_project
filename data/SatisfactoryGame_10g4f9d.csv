fireandbombs12,I bet if you scan for iron ore it says its there.
Twosliceofbread,""" There are still invisible ore patches, but they are hopefully fixed in the future"" 

Hannah. Also She fixed one oil node in UPD6 livestream"
houghi,The map is not done. There are a few where the image and the actual source do not line up. In programmering (This is what autocorrect gave me) these are two different things.
Gunk_Olgidar,There are a few stealthy nodes in the game.
KalIsSatisfactorized,"The other two that I know of (and am actively mining) are a pure Iron node in the >!Dangle Spires (-162,750/182,553)!< and a normal Sulfur node in >!Maze Canyon (126,778/-46,606)!<.  If you have a radar tower powered up, these nodes will show up on the in-game map, but won't be visible when you get to those locations (if you watch carefully, you may see a sparkle animation though).  As you've already figured out, you can still drop a miner on these nodes and they will function normally.  Map coordinates were taken from the SCIM Interactive Map, btw.

The sulfur and iron nodes are known issues:

Old_Fart_on_pogie,There’s also a few spots in the north that show oil deposits but you can’t put an oil extractor on them.
UristImiknorris,"There's a node under there, it's just also under the ground level."
clickthecreeper,"sometimes nodes there are invisible nodes. Sometimes you get a scanner result and there’s nothing there. Sometimes the nodes are there, but they’re too far under the map to have anything placed on them. Satisfactory is still in development!"
blly509999,"Yeah I was using the map website one time trying to setup something that used iron up northwest I think, in that jungle area north of the oil. Said there were 3 iron nodes but no matter what I did I could only find two. Eventually just pulled out the miner and pointing at places I thought it should be and bam, clicked in place."
Wallbreaker93,"Ah, the infamous non existent Iron Node. Reminds me of the days in the jungle crater where there were coal nodes disguised as limestone"
shalfyard,"I swear half of this sub is ""look at this hidden ore"" or ""what is this (inserts pic of jetpack Johnny)"".

At least have some of your factory in the background so the easily searched question has something else to it!"
Loose-Eye-6945,I see when You deleted it...
Savings-Bread-1705,My supercomputer factory on my main save actually uses the same iron node.
Shadowsans99,Underground veins?
PyroYeet0808,My main hub is currently using an invisible coal node in the pink forest (around the uranium node) for steel+gas masks
realamericanhero2022,Directional drilling ftw!
