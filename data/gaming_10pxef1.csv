Solivagant23,"My step counter goes crazy when I'm riding my motorcycle,  I'm about to be level 99 after a road trip haha"
rolfboos,"I love this app, one day I punted a small child and I leveled up twice from that."
will_ww,"*me walking into the pet store*

""Time to work on leveling up my Slayer!"""
sgtshenanigans,will half of 99 still be 92?
Skanach,"I always wanted an app kind of like this...a quest marker for daily/weekly/occasional stuff to do.

With tracker, XP, rewards.

Not just a boring piece of paper to scratch from that I will never find when I need it."
Pootain,"As a runner and an avid osrs player, I can't wait to give this a try"
JanJaapen,Do you do anything else than walk though? Or is it just a step counter with achievements?
twichthott,Sold. Where can I stay updated on this?
Senor_Andy_Panda,"*It's like RuneScape, but with extra steps!*"
B16B0SS,"You should look into Zombie Run (if you have not already) from, I dunno, 6-10 years ago with a similar premise but with outrunning zombies.  Had a story - not exactly the same thing but perhaps OP it will give you something to reference in terms of what it succeeded in doing and what it failed to do."
Drakogol,Can it import the steps from a smartwatch
iluinator,I just masturbated to level 25 in a single day.
MBVakalis,RuneScape Go
M-Spilsbury,"Run, escape from your computer"
Hanzi777,You should post on /r/2007scape!
BicepBear,This is pretty cool - I thought of making an account where you can only play it 1:1 with gym and workout activity. Getting to 500 total level on an account like that would be a good short term goal - we will see if I make a GYM Iron one day
Galusknight,"Sign me the fuck up as a beta tester, I am trying to lose weight atm and Pokemon go just is boring the hell out of me so this sounds right up my alley. any way to contact you to become a beta tester?"
Dragonbarry22,i dont play runescape but man do I need to be walking more
moodycroissant,When are you planning to release it? üòç
Sensai1,"I had a friend who thought this game was called RunEscape, I'm going to send him thisü§£"
Eastern-Cranberry84,this could be great if combined with geocaching
Mookie_Merkk,"ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä

Can you add a hard bass remix of sea shanty 2 for me to run to?"
Rdowns5526,Good job! This is a great and inventive gaming idea. Keep up the good work.
Fav0,"Cool

Can anyone recommend me an actual released game?

I do walk like 17k steps everyday just from work.. Might aswell use it"
thelostnewb,"Alternative title: RunEscape 

Though I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs taken."
carlosdanger112,I had an idea once‚Ä¶ it was a jump to conclusions mat
KKtwo,How do we keep up to date with this? Discord?
haaiiychii,Like Pok√©mon Go without the Pok√©mon?
Nasssi,How to get a gamer to exercise: Make it a game.
Calone,Can I fight my boss for his loot ?
Canter1Ter_,"I don't think you know how much runescape players actually move 

(Hint: not at all)"
Impressive_Sport_707,Fuck no
TheCaptNoname,"Why not eScape, tho?"
idunnololz101,You should force people to cut down trees for wood crafting and do parkour for agility. High stakes RuneScape üòÇ
ArcIgnis,What can I do at higher levels?
I2eB6L,Finally my in game stamina and real life stamina are the same!
ara-kananta,"Congrats anon, 

This will be the first real life strand type game"
flappers87,"Wife has an app like this, but it's LOTR based.

Tracks your steps and tells you how far you have left to go to reach Mordor, leaving the Shire. With all the things along the way... Bree, Weathertop and all that jazz, it's pretty cool."
panken,"Will it work while idle or do i habe to keep it active like pokemon go? 

Does it work with cycling?"
doubleUforthy,"You better release this app fast, cause someone is going to make one before you"
CheerioJack,Okay I'm throwing my smartwatch away for this.
danOmega,Will you be able to integrate with fitbit or Google fit/health so that it can get step and excersie data from there?
Bergfurgaler,Im gonna attach the phone to my dog and take him to the dog park for an hour.
st-shenanigans,Bro quick take this down before Niantic sees it and releases another pogo reskin
Crazy_Falcon_2643,"This is Pok√©mon Go but RuneScape version. 

Sheeeit, could theme it like LOTR"
,[deleted]
iniuria_palace,Can I beta-test please? Also willing to provide SFX for free just for the practice/fun of it.
mythoughtsforapenny,"I just had this idea on Sunday and didn't tell anyone about it and probably wouldn't have ever done anything with it. Therefore, I'm suing you for retroactive copyright infringement for using my broad completely undeveloped concept, beginning several months/years before I thought of it.

/s since I appreciate that the idea of any kind of copyright issue could be a source of unnecessary anxiety. It's funny how that happens, though. You think of an idea that makes a lot of sense, then shortly afterward you see that someone else is already making it happen. It's kind of cool."
deaddamsel,"You should check out zombies run, same concept but with zombies and the more you walk/run you unlock supply drops and stuff to fight off zombies from your camp"
xSikes,You sexy smart beast
BalthazarBulldozer,"For the paranoid amongst us who do not like apps using sensors and have 3 different pi-hole + adblocker setup, can we use this without the sensors?"
MortusMelee,Do you plan to release the game for androids or just apple?
Skeletor1991,"I'm loving the screen you have going so far. Think it would be really cool incorporating some sort of Map UI kinda like Pokemon Go or something, but pixelated or a ""fantasy map"" that shows what your character is doing as you travel. 

Like, just as an example, it would be awesome having like a character walking around the Runescape realm on the screen as you get all these stat updates as you keep walking.

Awesome job so far though!"
Noobpoob,"Just don't be like pokemon Go, and charge money for everything while also collecting and sharing users location"
driedyam,How can we stay up to date on when this gets released? Is there a website or newletters sign up or something?
Niaboc,Can't find a download link on the website or Google Play. How do I get involved?:)
LobsterPerspective,Just wanted to jump in and say this is something i‚Äôve always wanted. Pokemon Go was a decent option but that game quickly turned to shit. Looking forward to release!
drgmaster909,Curious what your tech stack is. Flutter? React native? Something more native? Looks good either way!
OneForMany,Everyone gonna have lvl 99 masterbation
killertortilla,Can I pickpocket men?
Cmax9874,"I would like this, thank you for creating it. Do you have a website or link I could donate to?"
Dukevon45,"Once this is complete, we're about to see a whole lot more fit gamers grinding IRL and getting their steps in."
KameSama93,"Any plans to bring it to IOS?, ive been wanting an app like this"
UltimateUsername1234,Bro took go touch grass to a whole other level
rektHav0k,"Okay so hear me out: 

1.  Partner with Game developers for loot cases/drops in games for walking.  

2.  Partner with restaurants/stores for gift cards for hitting milestones walking.

3.  Partner with gyms/boutiques for rewards for hitting milestones walking.

4.  Profit (while simultaneously encouraging people to be super healthy)"
pegabear,Raids would be a work out. Imagine doing olm rotations
dnflol,Where do I download
Nitjib,Every gamers‚Äô worst nightmare
ArKoJents,why not WalkEscape?
IndependentMath3,I think this looks very cool. I would definitely play this  :).
Wujastic,So PokemonGO but less interesting?
Chispy,"Jagex cease and desist coming in 3... 2... 1...

edit: I'm getting downvoted but Jagex does not take kindly to app developers profiting from their ip or anything remotely resembling it."
MyNameIsNotLiam,You mean WalkEscape
juniperberrie28,"Do freaking want, if you need any testers!!"
Indy_Pendant,Looks good. Let us know when it's out. ;)
demi-femi,"Dude I have always loved these.

Add day/turn based fighting with friends and randoms? Like you load up what attack, skill, magic, or item you wanna use at the beginning of the day. Then at the end, your progress for that day can be used as a modifier to boost its effect?"
vladlx992,"Will this be GPS linked or just a step counter. Is there a plan to implement connecting smart watches to do the tracking then sync to the app? 
Looks super promising, definitely going to try it out!!"
TheQuestionableEgg,"Also question, does this app need data to work outside?"
doctorcrimson,My dude took the OSRS complaints about the time spent just walking and made that into a game.
FlexViper,I hope I get a cape for maxing out my agility
Icefirezz,I'm 99 runecraft now and it took me 2 years so guessing that's the distance from the UK to Australia
mannimosity,Is it going to work with FitBit?
BootlegEngineer,I like where your head is at
getblanked,Is this out? I'd download it.
the_fathead44,"Physical activity games/apps like this are really cool and I'd like to try it out. I feel like I usually lose interest pretty quick with these, but the fact that it's an RPG may be enough to keep me interested for a while lol.

Edit: I went to the WalkScape subreddit and saw that this isn't available yet. I joined the Discord though, so I'll be keeping an eye out for it once it releases!"
Jantra,This sounds amazing!!!
Lurking_In_A_Cape,"Ok, this sounds like it's going to scratch my RS itch."
Winged_Yoshi,Walkscape mobile on release. Must be winter 2017.
ToiletGrenade,Tricking RuneScape players into going outside
gefeh,"So, uh, how do you increase slayer?"
CaptainBrightness,Well that just sounds like RuneScape with extra steps
BankOnTheDank,Imagine pokestop type locations with chests and loot and monsters to fight
ares395,Does it need to be open and active or can you have it in the background while doing something else or with your screen turned off...?
Supagetti,"I would very much like to beta test this, or otherwise pay for it once it's out."
Outrageous_Yak,I have one of these that‚Äôs LOTR themed! It‚Äôs unofficial but so fun
Tough-Channel-5490,The concept is great. ill 100% playing to get my fat ass to step away from my pc and I think it would be wise to put up warnings incase your too engrossed in playing that you dont pay attention to your surroundings when walking
ErikElevenHag,Can you buy a gf?
JRyanGreatfish,When is this planning to come out??
YO_XO,I like the icons and colors
H16HP01N7,"Can I cycle, instead of walk? I do most of my travelling by bike, so if it wasn't speed capped, like PoGo, then I'd give it a go."
FiveAlarmDogParty,Neat idea! Will it tie in to my Apple Watch for steps or will it track on its own using the phone? Sometimes I leave my phone behind on walks
Remarkable-Low-7588,This sounds really cool! I‚Äôd love to play this. It definitely would beat watching me close rings on the fitness app üòÇ
TippsAttack,I'm going to strap it to my washing machine and power level
jcarr11,Love this!!
ahhuwahhi,Iv been playing the OSRS soundtrack while performing chores and working. Just grinding and leveling up in the real world haha.
originalgg,Does this work as a background process or like pokemon go? Also releasing the beta during summer (you mentioned q3) could bring more people in
Yoyotree,Post this on the r/2007scape reddit they will love this over there.
WhiskeyDickGotNoChic,A hiking level would be cool.  Check in at trail heads and combine steps and trail difficulty to scale xp/hr
darkestvice,"Honestly, any mobile game that involves physical activity is a good idea. I remember really enjoying Ingress for a bit because of it."
OverlordFanNUMBER1,Well I am gonna need this later
ronintetsuro,This sounds like exactly what I need to get motivated to move around more. How do I help beta test?
LucyIsaTumor,"Very fun idea OP! I can see myself using this a ton! Two quick questions,

Do you plan on monetizing this app at all? Or will this be entirely a free to play kinda thing (with possibly a donation button if we wanna toss you a few coffees)

Also, if you do plan on monetizing have you checked with Jagex to ensure your project won't get canned before release with a cease and desist?"
Nosnibor1020,"This isn't available yet, right? I had knee surgery last year and I've been looking for a good excuse to get active."
Caridor,"I won't lie, this would probably help motivate me to get fit more than my fitbit does. Objectives and rewards (eg. level ups) help."
InsaneBeagle,"Oh my God I've had this idea for so long but never got around to creating it. I'm a dev, and I'd absolutely LOVE to help if I can! Shoot me a PM if I could help in any way!"
Heterosexual-Jello,Sounds awesome! A fun way to keep active is always a bonus. Keep us updated with the development!
Zaliron,"If I follow someone and they follow me, does it track the amount of times we strafed around each other?"
BobOki,"I would love it is someone would make a game based not on GPS location, but on actual steps taken, perhaps even linked to google fit or like fitbit steps. I would love to see competitive play with it, but that cannot really happen when it would be too easy to cheat.... but still would be awesome.

The reason why I would like this over another one of the 5000 gps based games is so I do not need to walk around potentially dangerous neighborhoods and can just hop on my treadmill for 5 miles and it count. Heck, maybe even allow for extra points through exercises and raised/elevated heartrate, the higher it goes the more bonus xp or something."
TGHVladiMatt,Use GPS+Maps data to play RuneScape music based on location and I'm sold. At least until Wildy music starts playing in schools.
randomgeeek,"This is absolutely insane, somehow I thought of a similar general premise yesterday, without ever having seen or heard of this prior."
othemehto,I would support this. I don‚Äôt know RuneScape but the base idea of rpg stat grind to increase ability works for me.
Dunduin,I've been looking for a fun exercise app. I will for sure be following this
protopet,Does this need an always on Internet connection? I would love to try this but most of my walking that isn't at work is in the mountains where cell data is iffy at best. I couldn't get into Pokemon go because it needed to be always connected.
MarinesRoll,"Holy shit this exploded, lets goooo!"
Unthgod,As long as you don't give me a tiny back pack and force my to make hundreds of trips from the quarry to the bank to get the bullshit amount of ore I need to level up ny Smithing
Thrannn,"I like games that play in reallife, but most of the time there is no gameplay.

There is just: wall 10000 steps to unlock X.  
But what do i do with X?

I need some gameplay to keep me interested for longer than a week"
Ark_Shrivastava,Nice way of keeping people engaged
TheTiz5151,I like you. I want this to do well!
Thepinkillusion,‚ÄúSweet level 97! Im half way to 100!‚Äù
n0tred,Will there be any compatibility with Fitbit?
Finchyy,"If I organically get to level 99 on one of the skills, do I get a cape?

(This would way cool and a great way to advertise the game)."
Greywacky,This needs clue scrolls.
mobog,Leaving this so I can hopefully find this when it comes out
blinkertyblink,"Am I going to have to walk the equivalent of the moon and back twice? 

One time for 1-92 then again for 92-99?"
Zahn91,This is actually an amazing idea!
Todmomamu,You son of a bitch I'm in
blode_bou558,Holy shit actually send me a link when it's done
Oakleaf212,"I played Pok√©mon go once then quit immediately when I realized how dog shit the actual gameplay aspect was.

The walking around and catching Pok√©mon aspect was cool and seemed great but it meant nothing to me if the gameplay itself was garbage.

What I‚Äôm trying to say is I would be interested in something like this but if the actual gameplay itself is dogshit then it‚Äôs going out the window for me."
Guns_and_Dank,"I know a lot of businesses host walking/step challenges for their employees, my company's doing one right now. This would be a way cooler way than just a straight leader board. Would recommend being able to create private groups/teams, but I imagine you're already on top of that."
X_L0NEW0LF_X,"Where, how when do i follow this development and get it?!"
saurogon,I hope it takes off like pokemon go did. That time in 2016 was no other.
Krohnan,"Ironically, the first time a friend told me to try RuneScape back in 2002, I mis-read the load screen and thought it was Run Escape."
Plushies_are_great,hopefully it can help me train runecrafting as well lol. looks like it will be a great app.
Kuldiin,Sounds amazing. ETA on this? I need to be less fat by summer!
itszxc,Can I use this like right now?
Ishmer20,I‚Äôd play. Let me know if you need help testing it. also would it track biking?
JasonGamesYT,"finally

I can train Agility while not wanting to kill myself"
Desirsar,"Anything like this?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94KwB205DDk

I've been dying for someone to make a game where they show this video to the team on a daily basis in some morning meeting.  So many games have come along that get kind of close, but they either drop the ball on the GPS part, or they focus on city/castle/guildhall building, or the encounters are entirely grindy and not engaging at all."
ThatOneKid1995,Will it work with smart watches like the Samsung Galaxy watch or Apple watch step counters that sync to your phones step counter?
,[deleted]
itsshiver1337,"What a coincidence, for 2 years we have also been developing a Walking RPG for mobile, we started with a similar approach, walking and leveling up your character while doing so, but soon the game turned into something way bigger.  
I wish you the best of luck with your project!"
_FlyingDragon_,"Do you already know when you will release it? I would love to have this. Will it be on playstore?
This already looks quite interesting from one picture alone. I love it, keep going! 

Will there be more updates about this?"
catsambience,"There was a game or a app back in the day, that let's you add tasks and then level up by doing them, does this or will this app have same feature? Imagen if you folks had servers and then if same task, has been created by several people, the XP would lvl out to be the average NR but of course program would pick the middle so ""cleaning toilet"" isn't 1 xp or 1 million xp"
nikkiknack,"As someone who spent many, many years playing RS, this sounds so cool!! I'm always looking for new apps to help me add a little more fitness and drive to my day, and something Runescape-y would be fun. Looking forward to seeing how it goes!"
bledolikiq,You know what would be nice? An email subscription thingy(or play store notification) where it emails you when the app is released.
HellveticaNeue,"Just a small comment; I really like the little highlight on (what I‚Äôm guessing) is the XP circle around the ‚Äú9‚Äù. Nice little detail.

üëè"
VentoliN1369,CANT WAIT FOR THIS!
roythejew,Fucking sign me up this is great!
dran117,When can we get this
trippy666love,I'm telling jagex on you
AxTROUSRxMISSLE,"That's not a game, that's exercise! You can't fool me!"
MarvelSports,Wait why wasn‚Äôt this a thing already?!?!
eiiusarneim,Lmao. Cool idea!
StaticGrav,This looks incredible. How much is it gonna cost when it's released? I'm a little hyped rn.
mmmasian,This is great!  Will it work by tracking steps (so I can do it on my treadmill) or will it be GPS based?
kilowog4613,"Love the idea, will this work if I ride a bike instead of walking?"
RJohn12,put woodcutting in
Sobah_Freeloadah,"Will it work with a treadmill? I use a treadmill most days and only get to exercise outside on the weekends. How do I get updates, it looks kinda fun!"
Asurao,"This is a great idea, and as a person who walks a lot I can see this being a fun way to reward myself. 

Question, are you using any backend for tracking progression, quests, unlocks, rewards etc?"
giantqtipz,"may I ask how you built this app, and how you got into game dev?

im a software engineer and would love to dabble in video game dev as a hobby, but not sure how and where to start"
Cant_Do_This12,"I actually love this idea. Holy crap, is this real? Should add a way to get spells that you can kill specific enemies/boss enemies with. You get these spells or skills by leveling up from walking and you can‚Äôt level further unless you pass the boss or something. You probably have something like this though. Can you add in a way to level faster by running or working out or something? Damn this would definitely help me get addicted to the gym again."
MarkWantsToQuit,Ui looks clean. What game engine did you use?
Stormhunter117,Extremely disappointed to not see an exp waste comment but maybe im just out of touch with osrs communiry
I-Have-Answers,Is there anywhere I can go to sign up for notifications? I‚Äôd love to check this out on release but worry I‚Äôll forget about it by the time I go to bed tonight lol
sev0,"This app is amazing. I actually looked something like this, but never saw anything decent. This one is amazing idea. Count me in as subscriber once it is done and released."
Twaggofrods,When is the BETA?
Forks_In_My_Eyes,"You can sell accessories to measure different exercises. Woodcutting can be leveled through doing the ab workout woodchops with the pulley machines, etc."
enthalpi,"I love this but I'm really curious about whether this is tied to distance covered or ""steps taken""? I use a walking treadmill quite often when it's cold or wet out, and would love to be able to play and ""walk"" from my desk!
  
Edit: I see your comments now about using step counters-- yay!"
Deliciouserest,Do walking apps like this work on a treadmill or do you have to be moving geographically?
Cricklet,Looks cool! Imma give it a shot
Sanosky,Can I afk it?
Viltrumite106,Is it on Android? This sounds really fun
Drpperr,"add item drops from random mission/quest rewards, opt-in pvp with stakes, and a grand exchange, and you've got yourself a winner."
nutgurb,"I clock an average of 6 miles at work, finally a game I can compete in"
No_Cantaloupe_4782,The hospital told me the law frowns upon IRL spawn camping.
NotOnlyMagicMan,Speedrun the game by speedwalking in real life
ABrazilianReasons,"Where do I sign up? 

Will it be available to android?

I loved the idea!"
SnooPickles8215,"Amazing love it, just don't sell out to Google and the rest of them."
rohallas,Do you lose levels if you don't walk?
OhSillyRabbit,Where do I presave? Or follow progress
I_Am_An_Octagon,When can I get my hands on this app? Will it be on Android?
MysticCurse,"I once had an app for runners where you could capture ‚Äúcastles‚Äù by running through the general area. It was a lot of fun but got boring after a while due to lack of strategy/complexity. I think if you can figure out a creative way to implement scalability rather than depending on steps alone, you could increase the lifespan of your app!"
ConfusedYoghurt,What language and frameworks are you using to dev the app?
kraydful,"Bro, bro, bro, bro, this shit is for me!! I walk 10k to 12k every day, how can I help you test this?"
Conscious_Ad_1379,Sounds cool. Can you notify me when it's available?
Cypeq,...and then you sell my geolocation data.
LacerAcer,"Sounds really fun, when can we expect to be able to play it? Or is it available somewhere already?"
LBMLBukowski,What? This is awesome!
LT_Corsair,"I try to walk 10km a day, this might finally be a game I'm good at"
Genericpotsmoker,I work at Walmart and go to college so I'm bout to max out
JustcallmeSoul,Oh boy! I can't wait to grind more efficiently by shaking my phone like a juice box for 8 hours a day.
SportFrequent,What is the name of this game?
Bogsnoticus,"Looks like you took the XKCD comic to the logical conclusion.  

https://xkcd.com/189/"
RNGesus____,How developed is this app already? I **REALLY** want to download it on my phone so I can grind during my school's annual hiking camp. (We literally walk 2x17 km a day)
onlydaathisreal,Definitely would love to have this. I walk 5+ miles per day with my dog and could use a little fun to break up the monotony.
OliverCafiso,Mobile?
OliverCafiso,Mobile?
k0skii,Will it have attack and str too?
MrFreeLiving,"Yes please! I need this, I'm always on my walks and always wish I created something like this, please be successful!"
Brasileirinh0,"Seems interesting, but what would make ppl stick to the game, like, what would keep the player on? I mean we‚Äôve had pokemon boom then it dropped a lot‚Ä¶ what are you planning besides just >walking<"
Toxic-Sky,I need to know when this hits iPhone! :D
ThievingOctopus,Any idea when this will be launched?
theguyoverhere24,When do you think it‚Äôll be completed?
TalynRahl,That is kinda genius. I hate how good an idea this is. I need it‚Ä¶
Trojanman2002,Does the app have to run in the background or does it pull the data from your phone when you open the app for the day?
KagDQT,When will this be coming to iOS? Can always use another gps rpg game to try out.
WiseBlizzard,"I am all about gamification! And this is quintessence of gamification. I'm downloading this right now!!!
P.S. its not on play market yet :("
yolopes_nocz,"Fuck, I‚Äôm so looking forward to this. Will definitely make the walks with my doggo much more fun!"
gameboy00,you gotta make skilling up from 80-99 a massive grind
Random_Criminal,That is so sick! I really wanna try this out.
magusonline,Until the location spoofers come and set a walk macro to walk in circles 24/7
crucifiedrussian,People gonna leave their phone on a record player to get the 99 agility
Squilliam-fancyson33,Runscape was right there
VxJasonxV,"I think he misread it, thinking it was called RunScape."
ktmpanda,"Id kill this game lol
 I walk 15k+ steps at work every day! Woo!"
KyloBinks,What skill can you level up sitting around doing nothing?
HighOnTacos,"Sounds incredible. I'm following the subreddit, but chances are I'll have totally forgotten about this by the time it launches."
HDReadyFridge,When is this expected to release?
Mizu_Soup_,This is so cool! Definitely would be a good motivation for taking walks. I like it.
spondgbob,We will watch your career with great interest
Snake101333,Really wanna give thos a shot!
stephendewey,Will this work with treadmills?
fleroshift,Do you have a discord channel?
Wondertwig9,Looking forward to it
jrnitc,I would love this concept! Please keep us updated!!
WTATY,"It‚Äôd be funny if there were encounters on your walk and if you don‚Äôt interact and just walk past the interaction it‚Äôd said you fled/escaped. Also, smart watch support would be good for this type of thing. I‚Äôll be real, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like to walk with my phone in my hand or constantly on alert for my phone‚Äôs vibration."
Rampaging_Scum,Sorry if this has been asked but will it track steps without the app open on my phone or my phone screen off
PanglosstheTutor,I‚Äôve been looking for an app like this. Pok√©mon go doesn‚Äôt really scratch the itch for a walking rpg for me.
illmattiq,Awww man Runscape would be awesome.
Edgy_Boy666,Will it be compatible with Garmins/other watches(through their respective apps) like that rather than just the phone stats alone?
GringYo,"If this works on a treadmill, I'm in."
zarkolan,"Gonna leave a comment here so I can keep tabs on this...I do lots of circles walking for my job, so this would be a great way get through the day! Do let us know when you release this!"
steveblais,Sounds amazing!! Well done and thanks for sharing! When will the game be available? or is it already (what platform?)
Losingmymind2020,I was a huge runescape nerd. This is awesome
BloodlustyGummybear,"I need this.

I love to walk. Sometimes I just step out my front door and let my feet lead me wherever they go.

For a while I was looking for an app that tracks my real life progress on digital representations of actual trails. I wanted to track the distance across Canada, or the Bruce Trail. I never found anything simple enough.

This is the app I actually needed. I never played Runescape but I can't wait to start leveling as soon as you launch!"
kastraks,When you plan to release? Gta6?
Prestigious_Seat_625,"I'm pretty sure my neighbors already own this game, but nstead of going outside they just play it right above me when I try and rest"
DavidrHaley,"I must follow you, until I see a game dev website or on Steam"
BlackV,And all the sweet sweet location data
Ok-Boisenberry,"As someone that works in a high movement job, this is really neat. Also good for some added motivation for my off days where I just want to lounge around. I would like to go on more walks.

Subbed. Cool stuff, looking forward to trying it."
MEerYOUer,"Sounds really cool, good luck on development! Is there a privacy policy or data collection/retention policy available yet? I wasn't able to find one on the website."
sparky1_2007,Do the levels take significantly longer to hit as you progress? Ex: half way to max level is 92 or 6 million ish exp? Haha
IRSeth,Time to strap it to the cat again.
tabletaccount,Can't wait to speedrun this game.
hell-on-hwheels,Guy with ADHD made a whole ass video game instead of just going on a walk - I feel you 100% homie

doug5791,"I made this same app in college, 2012-ish. The interface was MUCH worse. Called it RLRPG (real life role playing game). Used RuneScape experience/leveling system.

Allowed you to track Sleep, Movement, Exercise, Studying, Games, Work.

Leveling up unlocked clothing/accessory options for your avatar. Obviously the items were RuneScape inspired - my favorite was the Wizard hat.

Thanks for letting me relive that. Those days were the best"
