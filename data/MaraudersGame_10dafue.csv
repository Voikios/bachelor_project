HHgameking115,"You can always enter a raid and give him gear in the rustbuked and than just extract right away.
There are not a lot of people going for ship combat so it is very low risk imo."
Massive-Clerk-28,"Lobby inventory doesn't sound too bad. Even if it was something to only be able to do post raid. Maybe have a level requirement to be allowed to do it. Or even only those with at least one prestige, etc. However. They still haven't fixed the market. So I can't imagine how complex any sort of implementation like that could be."
