M0ntler,What the shit... My weekly rewards don't even make me want to read the quest twice.
nikMIA,"Your bro got the right energy

 ‚Äúwe go to streets?‚Äù"
fazza0123,"47,000 xp! Damn get going!"
Bubbly-Aside,Eh thats cause they know you'll jus die everytime while rubber banding.
Madzai,"Dailies are either crazy stupid with requirements and shit rewards or are totally bonkers. Got TWO hammers for some stupid items from Jager and 4 M4 for running Shoreline 4 times from Fence. Btw, his next daily was killing 6 PMC with F1 grenade for some garbage..."
tlrelement,Streets is great because when my FPS hits 60 I know everyone else is dead or extracted.
savy9,My friend got the same weekly except it was a black card.  We then proceeded to die 10 times straight times on streets.  Progress‚Ä¶
Ashisutantoo,Wtf
Trickdaddy1,Had a quest give a stack of 2 labs armbands from fence but it was kill 6 pmcs with leg shots on reserve and i barely had any time to do it :(

UnusualDifference748,I hope I never get a streets daily/weekly that gives great reward. I get 45fps on my scav I know my pmc will be worse than that.
Cr1t1cal_Hazard,I would absolutely deal with 50 fps just to run through the map 15 times
Twenty-Three23,Night time streets runs almost perfectly for me. The quest xp is so so sweet.
SmokeyAmp,"Get yourself a squadmate like this guy's friend: *""Okay, we going streets?""*"

Sad_Peepo,"Nice, I've had a great weekly too a few days ago, all I had to do was give ragman 12 security vests (the scav vests but black), took me 2 days and the reward was 40k exp, 200k rubs and one armor level 5 + one armor level 4, worth it"
