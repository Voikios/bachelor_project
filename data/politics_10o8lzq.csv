newnemo,"A 30% sales tax and cutting social security and Medicare.... Republicans for the working class is a cruel joke.

>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has backed his fellow Republicans into a corner with one of the promises he made to his far-right flank to land his job: opening the door to considering fringe legislation that would replace the income tax with a federal sales tax and abolish the IRS.

.....

>Democrats aren’t wasting time debating the fine points.

Support has been dwindling for the past decade, dropping by two-thirds since 2013.”



Telling us that a Republican proposal was ridiculous and unlikely to come to a vote, much less pass, is how we ended up with Donald Trump as president in the first place. I hope democrats beat the GOP over the head with this one for at least the next two years."

This party wants to impose a national sales tax? One that will disproportionately impact low and middle income voters. Even though low and middle class voters make up the majority of their base. Of course low and middle class voters are the overwhelming majority of every party base. The difference is GOP voters vote for these people because they believe taxes are too high. You can’t make this up."

IronyElSupremo,"Yeah, a huge blunder by the GOP pretty much ensuring a Biden-Harris win in ‘24.  Then there’s the GOP wanting to raise Social Security age at a time where American lifespans on average are declining (mostly due to GOP medical fratricide).  

Democrats need to use these GOP “greatest hits” in ‘24, though realizing the policies are popular in those R reps districts (i.e. retake the House and then play a game of “keep away” = play the electoral map correctly this time a.k.a. not holding my breath)."

IamWarlok,"People are really get fixated on the 30% flat tax and think that ALL goods and services will be taxed equally. 

THEY WON’T BE!

American conservatives are waging a culture war and tax cuts are their rallying cry. 

The second Conservatives get this tax increase pushed through they will immediately begin tax cuts and make exemptions on the flat tax. 

Guns, big trucks, tractors, the Bible and other conservative items will get reduced tax or exempted right away along with other relics of conservative culture that are too numerous to name. 

This is the part of the culture war where they are planning on making liberals paying the lions share of the tab.

If they can’t force you to be conservative, they will force you to pay more money on living the way you want to live."

Hans_Delbruck,">Each household will receive a monthly prebate based on federal poverty levels and household size that will allow families to purchase necessary goods, such as food, shelter, and medicine, essentially tax-free.

LurkingLarry43,"So I’m in my 40s and this is just an observation - the Republican brand has gotten more dumb, the older I’ve become.

Select_Insurance2000,"I will make this simple.
You want to buy a car.
The car costs $30k.
Your tax will be: $30k x 30% = $9k.
You want to buy a new home.
The home costs $100k.
Your tax will be: $100k x 30% = $30k
You want to buy a new, large screen 4k tv.
The 4k tv costs $2k.
Your tax will be: $2k x 30% = $600

SpicyNuggs4Lyfe,"Sales tax is a **regressive** tax. Meaning the poorer you are, the more you're paying. If you have a $100 to your name and need to buy $50 of groceries, that 30% tax on those groceries is another $12.50 of your $100. If you're a millionaire, that extra $12.50 means absolutely nothing to you.

This was maybe one of the GOP's dumbest ideas of all time. And in typical fashion, would've gotten rid of ALL corporate taxes. Making themselves and their rich buddies EVEN RICHER. Stupid fucks.

Put a 30% tax on luxury cars, yachts, and private jets."
ItisyouwhosaythatIam,The idea is class warfare.
Cal1V1k1ng,"Ahh yes, another tax that really only disproportionately impacts poor people, while letting the wealthy hoard even more money tax free"
Xtinguish,"For the uninitiated. The goal here is to replace income tax, capital gains, estate and ""earnings"" taxes and replace them with sales tax.

This would increase the wealth gap by increasing tax on people who spend a majority of their income every month and decreasing the relative tax on people who have money leftover to invest.

It's a truly evil peice of legislation. And to top it off it would gut the IRS and make it the job of states to police that people aren't evading taxes (including this national tax)."
IsGoingTTaM,GOP is worthless and a waste of every tax dollar. They don’t care about the American people at all. Decades upon decades of the same shit. Their base needs to wake up and stop re-electing and electing the swamp!

p6one6,"It is political gold.  It's letting the dumbest members of the Republican Party propose something that would upset 80-90% of their base, if not more.  The Republican Party survives because they have a general rule of concern for the stock market, which is what supplies income to retirees, their most dedicated voting base.  Telling retirees that they can expect 30% inflation, including those in Florida, is political suicide.

The problem now is that Republicans tried to.  It's not whether it passes, it's now something they need to answer to and will see ads about constantly during campaign season."
Buckeye_Monkey,"The whole thing doesn't make any logical sense. With the majority of people living paycheck to paycheck (i.e., spending 100% of their earnings after tax), they would need to be getting taxed at a greater than 30% rate by the federal government for this to provide any kind of assistance. Enacting this would force people to spend more money than they are already spending, or reduce their spending overall. Either option would absolutely tank the overall economy."
grixorbatz,"When these dick nibbles controlled the house, the senate, and the presidency, they never proposed any shit like this.   It's just political theater meant to arouse their sucker Magatt base while they sit back and say, ""See. Evil Biden won't approve our sound proposals"""

Emotional-Coffee13,Just look at the destruction caused w every top down tax policy the GOP has given us - the low growth thru their terms b cuz trickle down is a failed economic plan - their original idea was making trumps welfare permanent the same tax cuts Liz Truss rolled out in the UK suffering their worst nightmare now w that & Brexit (Trump said it would hurt global elites & make the UK great again)

DerekStu,"This national sales tax is straight up idiocy.

You know what would happen?  

First people would stop buying things they don't absolutely need.

Next, they would start bartering or buying things on the grey market.

All of this would tank GDP, our national revenue stream and the economy.

Are they genuinely this stupid?"
Feniksrises,This tax plan angers me. Making rich people pay their taxes is hard so let's just slap a sales tax on everything at Target and Walmart.
pinkfootthegoose,the sales tax would not backfire on the GOP. It is already in their playbook to blame the democrats for raising the price of goods. They probably already have the attack ads in the cans.
Relative-Dream-4804,Tax break and cheating for the RICH. That’s all it would be. 30% flat tax on everything. Enjoy!
Notsnowbound,"So, as I understand it the GOP platform is a national sales tax (it sucks to have one), cutting Social Security, abolishing the FBI, IRS and Justice Department, abandoning support for Ukraine, national abortion and birth control ban and pretty much destroying the public school system.  It's also in favor of burning coal, lead in gas, gas burning vehicles, and all modern utilities privatized.  It wants an expansion of prisons and apparently denies that racism currently exists and that slavery ever existed except for white people."
Iredditfromwork,Leave it to the GOP to propose one of the most regressive tax systems possible.
Rude-Cut-2231,"Sales tax is just another way to fuck poor people. If you live paycheck to paycheck and spend all you earn, then you pay a much higher percentage of your income on tax than someone who just adds their paycheck to their pile of money and sits on it"

Telandria,"Oh yeah, sure… food prices got another huge inflation bump the past few months, while at the same time the SNAP boost from covid is expiring…. 

Let’s add some extra taxes on top! I’m sure *that*’ll go well. /s

I don’t give a shit if it removes federal income tax at the same time, that’s only like 12-22% for most people so you’d still ultimately be upping taxes. 

And, if you’re like me, it’d be by a huge amount. I live off disability in a state that already has a sales tax in lieu of state individual income tax, and I don’t meet the requirements to need to file for federal income taxes because I live off disability — meaning all this would do is make my entire monthly cost of living go up by a full 30%. Which would probably see me out on the streets.

Typical fucking republicans, smh. Always trying to make the poorest people pay the most money."
liililllllliilillill,"What Republican had this idea.

No one will hear “eliminate income tax” if it’s immediately followed by “and institute a 30% sales tax on all purchases”

And that sales tax wouldn’t even make up for the lost revenue in income tax. We’d go into DEBT to institute a 30% sales tax on Americans.

Dumbest shit Republicans have thought up in a long time."
fyrejade,You can bet I’d never travel to the US anymore if this was reality.
SilentRidge,"Why are the republicans acting like they have any political capital and are free to pass whatever bullshit agenda they can dream up?  They failed to take the Senate in an off year, which opposition parties usually do, and they barely got control of the House (and they did thanks only to decades of gerrymandering).  They have no mandate.  They basically got smacked down in the last election.  And it's not going to get much better for them going forward.  They have an aging demographic and deeply unpopular ideas."
Economy_Ask4987,"Yes, taxing people who live paycheck to paycheck the highest effective tax rate in a country where 2/3rds live P2P is not great strategy to garner support.

chad917,"People don't even need to understand the concept of how this hurts lower income people who spend a greater portion of their income versus saving.

Bull_Winkle69,"I see this as a cheap workaround to give the wealthy a pass on taxes.

""You want to get rid of loopholes? Then we need a national sales tax!""

The rich make so much money they invest most of it and or transfer it overseas. 

A national sales tax will hurt working people the most. The less they make the more they must spend as a percentage of their income.

This national sales tax is just a scam. If they could really hit the rich with it they would just go shopping abroad"

zaxmaximum,"Isn't that what they want? A depression severe enough to push a substantial number of low and middle class homeowners to default; thus, giving them the opportunity to collect Single Family Homes for pennies on the dollar, and ushering in the age of perpetual renters?

Who needs gerrymandered districts when you can just not renew rental agreements of undesirables? Property ownership is a powerful thing, and they want that power for themselves."
lazrbeam,My god. We’re seriously talking about raising taxes on the common man right now? With record high inflation? With lay-offs coming?

sexysouthernaccent,"They need to bring this up in every economical talk for 20 years.

snow_big_deal,"Me reading the headline at first: ""Sales taxes aren't necessarily a bad idea, they're an efficient non-distortionary way to raise money, and can help a bit to deal with inflation""

detectiveDollar,"30% sales tax with no exemptions? Jesus, my state sales tax exempts most food (except for prepared meals, soda, alcohol, etc).

Also, those making less money spend a higher percentage of it on food, clothing, etc (people who make 100,000 spend more, but not 10x those making 10,000) while paying less in income taxes.

This proposal would absolutely screw them over.

This also actively encourages *not* buying products and services for those who can afford it, which is what our economy runs on.

m_chan1,"Ironically, many GOP members didn't back the bill, considering it's mainly the conservatives/GOP who wants to abolish the federal income tax and get rid of the IRS. One would think that all GOP members would fully back the Fair Tax bill but many did not. Also, the bill would've created 2 new tax agencies which would be worse than having one agency, the IRS.

Then again, they weren't intelligent enough to recommend repealing the 16th amendment which would remove the income tax, so if their bill passed, there would be both the income tax and the national sales tax, which would've been worse.

Also, the GOP never realized the repercussions on the state level as many states with income taxes base their income tax on the federal level and modify it on the state level. It would create chaos across the U.S. for many states."
JJDude,These Russian agents are so eager to break the US that they proposed something which the pre-Russian GOP is always firmly against - Tax Increase.  But they are too evil/dumb/ignorant to give a shit about that.

Exocoryak,"Conservative fiscal policy is always wacky.

Trickle Down economics: Cut taxes for the top 1% and wealthy corporations, while the little man is hurting.

Cut Social Security in a time of need and high unemployment.

Reduce government investment in order to ""balance the budget"", in times where government investment is the only thing keeping certain industries affloat. 

And now raising taxes, while things are already becoming more expensive on a rate that's faster than the growth of wages.

In this day and age, fiscally responsible and fiscally liberal should be synonymous - because liberal fiscal policy always has a higher ROI than it actually costs. And fiscally conservative should be synonymous with fiscally regressive - because conservative fiscal policy always leads to lower revenues, far outweighing the cut costs."
MaxRockatanskyBronze,"Politicians are always looking for new ways to tax the middle class to pay for tax cuts for their donors.

p001b0y,Where does the 30% figure come from? I don’t want to make it look like I am casting any doubts; I am just terrible at math. The bill itself states it is 23% and the Republican sponsor says it is a myth while using bad math to illustrate why but I don’t understand where the 30% comes from.
QristopherQuixote,"Regressive taxes are constantly front and center for republicans. They would rather see a fixed fee where everyone pays the same regardless of your ability to pay.  The only fair tax is income applied with the same progressive rates to individuals and corporations - no loopholes.  All income should be treated the same whether capital gains, wages, dividends, interest, inheritance, etc.  Make taxes super simple with big deductions for primary residences when sold, small businesses when inherited, etc.  However, we need to eliminate loopholes like carry forward losses, trusts, and other tax avoidance schemes.  We should get $15k per person adjusted for inflation on a return regardless of a relationship, and we should eliminate the marriage and single person penalties.  Taxes should be collected and submitted at the time of a transaction rather than at the end of the year or quarterly. Most people should have returns automatically created with a bill or refund generated automatically. Make taxes simple and fair, and the deficit will be gone overnight."
okram2k,Imagine that. The democrats pointing out to all Americans just how little the GOP cares about financially helping the lower classes that constantly vote for them is a good idea. Who'da thunk it?

ThinkitThroughPeople,"The GOP national sales tax is really just a Trojan horse to get rid of Social security.  At present Social security and general taxes are separate.  If Social security runs low on funds, they reduce the benefits to remain solvent.  If the programs under general taxes run low on funds, the government needs to borrow more money. Social security does not contribute to the deficit.

By combining both systems under a national sales tax, social security would now contribute to the deficit. With the increased deficit the Republicans can advocate for eliminating all ""entitlements"".

Also I notice it's essentially a flat tax which would be disastrous for lower income people.  This guarantees poor people will join in the fight to eliminate ""entitlements"".

If they were serious about this they would make it fairer.  Don't tax food, medicine or medical care.  Charge a higher rate on yachts, private jets, the cost of homes above an areas average, second homes, etc."
