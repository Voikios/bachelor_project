logicality77,"From all accounts, Iwata was a genuinely good person. Good role model in general."
akoli,"I loved my Wii U , one thing they haven't managed on the switch which I miss was in Splatoon , two players, but no split screen shenanigans,  one uses the tv the other screen on the control pad.... That was clever, with gyro controls too."
IAstate2015,This says more about Japanese culture than anything else imo. Don’t think we’ll ever see an American CEO do this lmao
El_Cringio,"Jarvis, my karma is low. Find an old Nintendo pandering fact and post it on r/gaming."
chucksstuntman,I see this posted on here and Facebook for years now
WindUpShoe,50% off all titles in e-shop in commemoration lol
Burnstryk,"In a time of reposts, karma farming and general ass-holeness on Reddit, let's all try to not repost the same shit for years on end."
subOptimusPrime16,"Step 2, recoup lost revenue through litigation of our loyal customers and fanbase."
workout_nub,"I'm not saying this is the case here, but most times this is corporate feel good BS. They could have a salary of $0 and still make millions in bonuses."
Thug_shinji,It's a shame nintendo is still a horrible company with predatory practices for both their customers and developers.
aeminence,Then sued and went after a bunch of content creators and took down their eshop.
TwoDurans,"I hate how often this story keeps getting thrown around. He took less cash in exchange for stock. Did it help their operating income in the short term, yes, but he ended up making hundreds of millions of dollars in the next few years. 

Iwata was a great man, but this move wasn't some kind of altruistic endeavor to take blame for the failure of the Wii U it was a Hail Mary gamble that paid off for him."
Fritzschmied,Tbh I like my WiiU more than my switch. Combined with the downwards compatibility with Wii games it has such a great selection of games and pretty much all of the good switch games (at least for me) are just remakes of WiiU games like for example Mario kart and Breath of the wild.
Sir-Kevly,Our hero then went on to send cease and desists to several fourteen year olds for streaming their pokemon themed dungeons and dragons campaign on Twitch. Truly a man of the people.
JustinJakeAshton,All I see is Mr. O'Hare.
Nicktendo,This man also single handedly salvaged Pokemon silver/gold and made it into the game you remember it for.
_NightmareKingGrimm_,"The Wii U allowed Nintendo to perfect their plans for a mobile console and eventually design the Switch. 

1 step backward is worth several steps forward."
Wolf_of_Walmart,The Wii U didn’t fail. The public failed the Wii U.
gosohabc123,They were spending way too much money suing content creators and ROM sites over games they make any money on so something had to be cut back.
RJD2-4000,Wii U is a great console.
DS_Inferno,"This was a decent move by Nintendo. 
Easy to forget about with some very overzealous copyright claims and anti preserve behavior when it comes to their IP's."
SaulJoker,I miss Iwata.
,"I don’t think anyone should envy Japanese business practices… sure the ceo acted honorably ONCE 11 years ago. 

Like, is anyone actually aware of how shitty it is working in Japan? You’re pretty much expected to live at your job lol."
IMarioKart7toomuch64,"Sega did this too. Once Sega CEO Isao Okawa gave $695,000,000 out of his paycheck to save the company from going bankrupt. The poor man died only a few weeks after donating hundreds of millions of dollars in shares to Sega, passed away in a car accident from what I know. Absolute legend, & is the reason we still got Sonic, Yakuza & everything else Sega still does. Why do those who do good in the world die early?"
GetReady4Action,"I feel sorry for the vast majority of people who didn’t play Wii U. was an awesome lil machine that suffered an ill fate because of its odd naming scheme. it finally brought Nintendo into the HD era and because third party support was so barren, Nintendo picked up all the slack and made some of their best work. it sorely lacked a 3D Mario and a Zelda (let’s be real, the moment Switch went into development Breath of the Wild became a Switch launch title and only released on Wii U because of obligation,) but Mario Kart 8, Super Mario 3D World, Smash 4, Mario Maker, Pikmin 3, Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, Captain Toad, etc. were all awesome. in a weird way, I kind of prefer the Wii U’s approach to being a “hybrid” system over the Switch’s where you have the main machine in the house doing the heavy lifting, but you have a perfect, lag free stream to the tablet. I would love for Sony to do something like that, but I know it’s a totally niche thing that’ll never happen. I would loooooooove to play God of War: Ragnarok in bed, but remote play, while pretty darn good, is just not quite it. Wii U nailed that idea and while I like the Switch being an “all in one” place to play, it’s massively underpowered.

with all of that being said, I think Nintendo needs to just keep innovating the Switch going forward so there’ll never be another Wii U fiasco. just give the people the Switch 2 with more horsepower, updated drift-free joycons, maybe better battery life, the option for joycons with a legitimate d-pad, and boom. another home run for Nintendo."
DerCatzefragger,"WiiU was a fantastic console. 

 Complete and total failure of the ***marketing*** department."
Lazlow_Morphine,I liked the wii u thought it was a great console.  And really enjoyed the games on it that are currently and have been remade for the switch now
Bariq-99,"Even better.. He did it TWICE!

he later cut this 50% another 50% just to not fire anyone"
PolyZex,And then sued a fan for remaking Mario 64 in the Unity Engine in what would have been a free learning tool for developers.   HE may have been a good guy but Nintendo as a whole... that's a different story.
WolfPaw_90,"Yes this was a nice thing to see, but he was still getting a ridiculously high salary I bet."
hiricinee,"I still play my wii u- my kids love it now.   Great console, bad marketing, REALLY weak launch lineup.  When your big draw is a 2d mario game that's essentially the 3rd or 4th in a spin-off series you might have missed the mark.  But to the consoles success- a massive chunk of the Switch's best titles are wii u ports.

Some top notch games on there- and Starfox Zero will likely NEVER be ported because of its unique use of the hardware, among some other games."
StuckOnPandora,"And yet, as an owner of a Wii U, I can tell you it was by far the most over-looked console that generation. 

A Radeon inside. Nintendo's first HD system. Great emulation. I love my Wii U, it's just a better HD Wii (with a Wii baked inside).

If the Wii U had succeeded and the Gamepad was a touch better (range and battery) we could have seen some amazing projects brought to Life. Even games that only utilized it as a menu screen, or a couch co-op second screen, tell me that isn't convenient? Once you play a game where the Inventory can always be tapped while playing, quest log, map, etc,. it's hard to play anything else...except it's the Wii U and so it didn't move the needle."
esoteric_enigma,"This isn't an Iwata thing. It's my understanding that this is standard and expected in Japanese culture. I remember reading stories of other Japanese CEOs taking pay cuts when companies have bad years.

It's mind-blowing as an American to hear a CEO taking responsibility. Our CEOs can literally run a company into the ground and are rewarded with a fabulous severance package when they're fired."
dugthefreshest,"Iwata is a treasure.

Unfortunately Nintendo as a whole is the worst there is.  They single handedly destroyed competitive Smash. They absolutely give zero fucks about their player base (probably why they relaxed a console and a team based shooter without a mic jack)"
Capable_Edge_1236,I thought this was because of the 3DS...
,"Not in America. It’s always the everyone else’s fault, except the leadership."
KingofCards011185,"Ask Iwata, recommended read"
achio,"And, like everyone say, the good ones always leave too soon."
Anavorn,Dead?

Echo71Niner,"In North America, they cut 50% of the workforce."
Safe_Ask_8798,i'll keep this in mind next time im a CEO of a large company
MasterDimentio90,# TWICE.
WeepingAngelTears,Tax dodging is one of the most moral things you can do.
TheMagnuson,"Nintendo mismanaged the release of the Wii U so badly.  Most people didn’t know what it was, was it an addon for the Wii, a new console, what?  I remember even websites dedicated to covering video games where still unsure what the Wii U was until it actually released."
CraftsmanMan,The switch is a long range wii u.. change my mind
SuzanoSho,"Didn't he take more stock instead?


Y'all act like this was some sacrificial gesture that saved the company..."
elmachow,He’d have chopped the end of his little finger off in the old days
jacobythefirst,"Wii U was the goat, wish it had done much better tbqh"
cheknauss,...But can we get any form of friendly gestures/respectable emotes in smash bros to hopefully combat the cancer that is some of its player base?
SharkMilk44,This is just Japanese culture.
ElvenNeko,That's kinda logical thing to do. How workers are responcible if they are only doing what you told them to do? Leaders should bear all responcibility.
riicccii,"Good on you, Boss"
ph30nix01,I loved the Wii U.  ZombiU was amazing and showed the console had so much potential.
Kira_Aotsuki,I miss Iwata
seansy5000,Wii U was a branding issue. The few people I know that own it loved it.
RealMemeLord876,"He and Reggie were real bros, RIP Iwata, I hope Reggie is enjoying retirement"
SplendedHorror,Am I the only one who liked the Wii U my family still uses it over our switch it has some good online games
MiniatureRanni,“Let’s all try be more like Iwata” bro how many CEOs do you think are going to see this Reddit post
IHadFunOnce,RIP in peace Iwata.
RyanAntiher0,What an absolute champion.
DeathChron,I absolutely loved my Wii U
CyberAsura,"American CEO: I ain't going to apologize for shit, you are FIRE! 

JP CEO: Please accept my sincere and humble apologies"
cy13erpunk,"its called being honorable 

a pretty big deal in japanese culture 

not so much everywhere else unfortunately 

and fwiw no the japanese are not perfect , but in some areas they certainly try harder than most"
chaserguida,Probably supported by his side hustle as CEO of O’Hare Air
heygreene,My family just played the Wii U tonight. Mario Kart 8 FTW!
GandalfVirus,Turns out his pay was only $2 at the time so it didn’t do much.
Phantom_Wolf52,Satoru Iwata really was such an amazing ceo an amazing person who cared about his employees and fans rest easy king
WrongdoerLive6695,Wii u was ahead of its time it needed better aesthetics however.
TheFlexOffenderr,Iwata was the heart and soul of Nintendo and nobody can change my mind.
neckos,Said in defense of the greediest company in the business...
HowWeDoingTodayHive,Would be tight if they could take that same energy and throw games on sale every once in a while
Put_It_All_On_Blck,CEOs of major corporations don't really care that much about their salaries. As making hundreds of thousands of a couple million is nothing compared to what their stock options in the company can bring them.
AbyssalNazgul,That says a lot. That’s an awesome dude.
kemar7856,I would say this more because of Japanese culture
kidanokun,"Just sad this man is no longer around when Switch came out, the one that perfected what Wii U aimed to be"
yapper5013,was the wii u even bad?
DedeLionforce,"Wii U was the best, love that thing."
19Ben80,"But the staff are already working 12 hours a day 6 days a week as is the norm..

The ceo was still rich at the employees expense"
airforcevet1987,Just reboxed it as a switch a few years later lol
Riparian72,"The only time Nintendo ever had a price cut and it was the CEOs salary. Meanwhile you can’t get any of their games for less than they were years ago. 

Also RIP Iwata"
Oime,"Yet Nintendo is still one of the most asshole companies ever when it comes to the competitive scene, or just using their ip’s in general. These assholes will cease and desist fan art you doodle in your 3 ring binder during algebra class."
skippyspk,"So I’ll probably be downvoted to oblivion in this, but keep in mind this was largely a symbolic gesture.  Halving his salary had little impact on the P+L from either strictly a profit or operating expense perspective.  Nintendo is very cash rich as well.

What it DOES show is accountability and likely gives his employees an extra pep in their step and boosts retention.  

Also…the Wii-U was awesome and I’m sad it didn’t take off.  However, I’m glad they were able to leverage those lessons learned to create the wild success with the Switch.

That being said, fuck Nintendo for not transferring virtual console purchases from one console to the other.  Even XBox has the decency to have purchases follow the consumer between generations.  I can play Heavy Weapon wherever I god damn well please in XBoxland bahaha.

Tangent and rant over!"
lan60000,never understand why this sub loves nintendo so much
Crissaegrym,"In the Western world, employee will face pay freeze or lay off to pay for this mistake.

While the CEO get a bonus for excellent damage control to protect the bottom line."
Venixed,"Think this is a cultural thing but i'll be damned if I don't dream of CEO's being this decent to people, I wouldn't have such a problem with ultra rich people if the money was just better for us people at the bottom, it's not much to ask, I'd like to work to live, not live to work thank you"
CheerioJack,Then sues everyone for anything...
mrfat187,But let's all remember that Nintendo hates their fan base and loves to copyright strike anyone on twitch or YouTube because reasons.
Frikken123,"Man, the Wii U rocks"
Task_wizard,"And the WiiU was a great console. I think the two main factors in it bombing were- 

1. it looked fucking ridiculous, you really needed to hold/play on it to see experience how practical it was. 

2. it was hurt by it’s predecessor being SO damn successful. Everyone and their mom had a Wii, not everyone purchases every generation of device and if every single Nintendo user and even most of the non-Nintendo people have a Wii, including people who normally aren’t the gaming demographic, it can cause expectations to be through the roof even though there is almost no one who thinks they “need” a new console."
escape_of_da_keets,"Ah yes, Nintendo... The company that will send a cease and desist and cut your balls off if you make a Mario diorama for 2nd grade show and tell."
TheStevesie,"Yes Nintendo, the company that sues people like crazy.  Very nice company."
FreakinSweet86,But from the ashes of the U came the phoenix that is Switch
Jonas_Sp,Nice karma farm bud
Drachusz,"Nah, fuck Nintendo. Worst video game company"
TheToughBubble,Kinda like how Donald Trump donated his entire presidential salary to various organizations during his office term.
PunchUrLeg,OP unaware that Nintendo never do good sale prices for their too games unlike Sony and Microsoft.
Theinfamousemrhb,"Some American CEOs cut their pay to 0 or as low as possible...

YuuHikari,"Meanwhile when our company's sales bombed, our boss simply didn't give our 13th month pay and our salary."
kenien,Didn’t that turn into the 3DS
Oldmansoulman,American CEOs: We don't do that here.
Kenju4u,Cut his wii wii.
KevnElevn,I actually own a Deluxe Wii U
Hateno_Village,Iwata was a gem. RIP
Celeste_TransGirl,"The Wii U will forever be my favourite console of all time, great graphic, great games (most were ported on Switch), compatible with Wii games and controllers, Gamepad was so cool to use and comfortable to hold, the Eshop, Miis and the home screen that was so much more lively and cuter than the Switch..."
PotentialLopsided217,Thats the prototype of the wii u. You can tell because it uses circle pads a joysticks instead of joysticks.
Cruxito1111,"America CEO would have gotten big fat bonuses, and move factories across the world."
tootyrobooty4926,I love my Wii U

Admirable-Dot-8535,"That's nice and all, but Nintendo is known for their backwards ass pr policies."

Shitty ass spam bot OP. Report this crap"
amitrion,I've bought every Nintendo version. I loved this one. Breath of the Wild using this tablet was way cool. Youngest son also loves playing as Bowser on the tablet in Mario Party.
NiftyJet,Does the CEO set their own salary? Wouldn't that be up to a board or owners?
,Wii U bombed so that the Switch could live.
btk79,Would the up in stocks immediately compensate for this cut?
thundercod5,Then in a master class of business and operations they took all those unused Wii U controller screens and put them in the Nintendo switch and it sold like crazy.
TheSanityInspector,Same culture where the baseball teams write letters of apology to their fans after a losing season.
PurficPourBY,Nintendo is like the opposite of consumer friendly they suck actually lol
streetsofkage,This is like the 100th time this has been posted this year already
soahcthegod2012,"The heart and soul of Nintendo died with Iwata

RipWhenDamageTaken,"Meanwhile, in the meta verse…"
ManiZach,"I still remember the wii u. For a long ass while, I thought it was a Wii alternative-pro-type of console. Not sure if it was the advertisement or not, but with PS1 -> pS2, Xbox -> xbox360 I knew right away, but with the wii u..."
Thesassysam6626,"Even if what people are saying is true that he didn’t really loose all that much by cutting his salary, it doesn’t take away from the moral high ground he went with. 

The guy realized that even big companies make mistakes. And instead of pulling an American move by just declaring bankruptcy and funneling as much money as he could to himself by sacrificing his employees, he made sure they were able to continue with their jobs and their lives. 

This guy recognized that he had an extremely talented team. And that sometimes speculation and even market testing don’t result in what is expected.

And look at the result. The switch comes out and shakes the very foundation of the earth with how fast those things flew off the shelves. 

There’s a reason Nintendo have remained in the game so long. They’ve had a succession of competent leaders and if anyone here is a history buff, they’ll know that having good leadership in tough positions can make or break empires, let  alone companies."
Black_Hussar,When the Wii U had 3DS circle pads instead of proper analog sticks
IlNuovoImperoRomano,That guy just looks like a taller version of Mr. O'Hare from The Lorax

Bearly_OwlBearable,"The wii u fails was a marketing fails

IAmRealtorRob,Nintendo as a corporation are also way more greedy than most other game companies.

KillgorTrout,Looks like he may be Frank Reynold's son from one of Frank's business trips overseas.
Prikker,"Sadly Nintendo rapidly went downhill after his passing and has become as greedy as all other companies out there.

I miss the old Nintendo that actually released new quality games. Modern Nintendo just re-releases the same games over and over again or just releases broken crap.

They are lucky to have such a dedicated fanbase who would literally buy a turd if it has the Nintendo logo on it."
photoframes,I miss him
KrushaOfWorlds,Ah yes because mistakes and marketing fails don’t happen
PooperJackson,Is this like the modern day equivalent of falling on your sword after committing great shame

TeenLaduk,That mans gonna try and sell air
PooperJackson,Conan has continued to pay his staff after going off the air. I think he's still paying them out of his own pocket years later. He's a great dude.
eastcoastkody,"the whole failure of the Wii U is so annoying. '

Because ultimately i buy a console because of the game library. And the Wii U game library was so strong that they are still selling tons of copies now as Switch games. 

The whole internet hating on it and ppl with one braincell that couldn't handle the name.....somehow killed this thing. 

3rd parties were also complicit. By putting out half baked ports. 

Wii u had a better exclusive library nearly the whole time it existed compared to xbox/playstation"
New-Lavishness4260,My mentor...
the1slyyy,The CEO has a lot of influence over the product when it's only 1 or 2 consoles. He bares some responsibility for the failure too
Foxwolf00,The Japanese have personal responsibility drilled into them from a young age. This is probably culturally related to that. Many Americans know nothing of personal responsibility and expect the government to do things they can do themselves.
levilicious,no one gives a damn anymore about having honor or respect. this man is setting a prime example

Lord_DF,Well the difference between him and the others was that Iwata was a decent person.
St3fanz,"I spent several mornings in the early/mid 2000s taking morning swims with Iwata (and Miyamoto) at the Hollywood and Highland hotel during E3. I was a guest of Nintendo. I knew him before his promotion, and had gotten into an awkward but friendly argument about the viability of the original (non backlit) GBA screen.

He’s a really nice and gentle person. Humble, kind, prefers listening than speaking. The exact opposite of the archetypal senior exec."
