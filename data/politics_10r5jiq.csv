M00n,"*""This pledge is an affirmation of your defense of democracy and the Constitution,"" Cicilline. ""It’s hard to take that claim seriously if in fact, an individual in any way supported an insurrection against the government.""*"
ImLikeReallySmart,"Cicilline is fantastic.

> Gaetz: I mean the last Republican president to get sworn in absent Democratic objectors was George Herbert Walker Bush

> Cicilline: I said I will allow the *chairman* to determine whether or not someone has participated in the insurrection of the United States. I think this language is important. I'm asking Mr. Gaetz will you now accept the amendment?

> Gaetz: **I'm concerned that you may be disqualifying too many of your own members, Mr Cicilline.**

> Cicilline: **I'm not concerned about that at all**, then agree to the amendment?"
OppositeDifference,"I mean, do they or do they not have a point? 

The fact is that every single member of congress that was tied up in January 6th should have been removed under existing laws we're apparently too cowardly to use."
Dervishing-Hum,They SHOULD ALSO BE BANNED FROM HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE. Heck-- they should be in prison!!
Cuck-In-Chief,How about we ban any member who has sex trafficked a minor from committee
dangroover,Insurrectionists should be banned from the House. Period.
TUGrad,"It's interesting how they are ok w engaging in the act, but feign outrage when called out on it."
WhatRUHourly,"This is awesome and hilarious.

Also, the Pledge of Allegiance is stupid and unAmerican."
No_Yak_6227,"Banned from leading the POA ?? Why is trump (twice impeached leader of a coup against this country) even mentioned as a candidate for the presidency? and why are all the insurrectionists not removed by Article14...What the hell is wrong with this picture? 
If you don't learn from history ...you are bound to repeat it"
bootes_droid,Matt Gaetz is such a flaming pile of shit
LiberalHousewife,Seriously. Who TF cares about who says the Pledge - the PROBLEM is that the insurrectionists are still able to hold office. This is a great way to do something about it without doing anything about it at all.
Hermit-Sensei,"You know what? the pledge of allegiance is a perfect encapsulation of how fucked up US political culture is. We love to tell the world about how much we love freedom of expression and religion and detest indoctrination and 'big brother' governments, but also **YOU WILL** declare your love for God and America every day from kindergarten to high school graduation.

I'm so fucking sick of people in this country tripping over each other to prove how patriotic they are. People are way too obsessed with being proud of the random chunk of land they happened to be spat out upon."
gives_free_rimjobs,Fucking pledges of allegiance. Such bizarre and dated pageantry.
Maligned-Instrument,"Josh Hawley, Ron Johnson, Boebert, Gym Jordan et al. should be huddled in the corner of a prison cell getting traded for a box of Ramen noodles and the fact that they aren't shows you the state of the justice system in this plutocratic shit hole."
thereverendpuck,"https://constitutioncenter.org/amp/blog/the-latest-controversy-about-under-god-in-the-pledge-of-allegiance. 

Weird fixation of forcing the Pledge when forcing the Pledge has been ruled on repeatedly by the Supreme Court that is something you can’t do.  Then again, these people are the same ones who demand religion be put back in schools when it was never a part of them."
Canaan_Kangaroo,"How about just fuck the Pledge of Allegiance? It's creepy, idol worshipping bullshit."
ScrapDraft,"Republicans: We should do the pledge of allegiance before each meeting even though we ALREADY do it each morning.

Democrats: That's fine with us as long as the person leading isn't a traitor to the country.

Republicans: DEMOCRATS ARE AGAINST THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE!!!!!!"
ConstantGeographer,"No-brainer.

If you promoted the Big Lie... gtfo

If you supported the Insurrection... gtfo

If you supported Trump... gtfo

If you trafficked in kids... gtfo

If you ban books... gtfo

It's a no-brainer and unfortunately we have a party of no brainers."
Ajegwu,"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion

NO LAW

Fuck your ‘under god’ bullshit and get it out of my life.

ABOLISH THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE NOW"
LiberalFartsMajor,"Fireworks? 

Did MTG plant explosives in the capital building again?"
Complex_Construction,Imagine my disappointment when I realized it was not literal fireworks
sunnydaysahead2022,"They pledged allegiance to the confederate flag all the time. They should just be honest about it. They don’t work for the US. They are there to harm the US. 

Sedition is worse for a country than any other offense. It’s where the citizen want to harm the US from within. 

And we have so many who are currently in our government - and so many who support them."
Vulcan_MasterRace,Insurrectionists should be serving prison sentences not in the highest levels of the government
RammsayB,"Objecting to electors is a function of Congress and is not an insurrection.

What the republicans did, supported, and encouraged at the Capitol on Jan 6 is an insurrection.

Trying to tie them together is dumb and Gaetz knows that. An insurrection agitator or supporter should be expelled from Congress so preventing them from reciting the Pledge shouldn’t even be a problem.

The whole discussion could be prevented by getting rid of the currently unconstitutional version of the Pledge. Get rid of it, or make it constitutional again. Get your god(s) out of government, I don’t care what one(s) it is."
mymeatpuppets,"From the article.

*It began after Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., offered an amendment that would give the committee the opportunity to begin each of its meetings with the Pledge of Allegiance. He said the rule would give members “the ability to invite inspirational constituents” to be able to share and lead in the pledge.*

Republicans finding yet another way to waste the time allotted to do the work of governing in favor of frivolous right wing virtue signaling."
1lapulapu,Insurrectionists should be banned from Congress.
from_dust,"That any nation still *has* a pledge of allegiance is kinda fucked up. I never did it growing up, because I was in a weird cult, but i watched the kids i was in school with. Some of yall had your hand on your heart, but pretty much everyone is just standing there chanting an incantation at a flag with dead eyes. It's creepy af."
NotAnonymousAtAll,"> House members already recite the pledge on the floor every day

That in itself is already incredibly bizarre, without even considering any of the stuff this article is actually talking about."
djuggler,Here’s an idea: how about not allowing insurrectionists to hold any seat in government?
rounder55,Love when Cicciline said he wasn't concerned about that at all when Gaetz tried to use some whataboutism bullshit with Democrats and W in 2000. Republicans don't know how to react when you tell them it's about the country and justice instead of attacking a political party
MagicalUnicornFart,"We still give the traitors a say in the government, they’re openly trying to destroy. 

The whole “we should listen to both sides” has been taken to an extreme, as not every idea is something worthy of debate, and discussion. 

The seditionist traitors have no place in our government. Period. 

By the time enough people realize this fact, it will be too late. Treating people with extreme opposition views, and anyone still in the party of election deniers, and bigots…no matter how “fiscally conservative” they are, has no place in the government. They openly defy the laws, and the “opposition” looks at them as colleagues in Congress. How would you feel if your coworkers sent a mob to kill you, and riled people up to insult, and harm you? Yet, we let them back into Congress. The woman that was giving reconnaissance tours to attacking traitors, has a position on the Homeland Security Committee. 

The guy who organized, and pushed for the coup, who was impeached twice, and used the office to profit, with our tax dollars, and mismanaged the pandemic just officially announced he’s running for office.

We’re circling the drain, and so many people are in denial, and just clicking away buying toys. As long as they’re stock options are up they give zero fucks about anyones future."
clanelinn,"TRAITORS should not be allowed in CONGRESS, let alone to lead the pladge to a country they have already BETRAYED!!!"
jchowdown,"The lie, where is it?"
TarkusLV,"TBF, everyone should be banned from leading the Pledge of Allegiance. What is this, North Korea?"
duder167,"I like how they just gloss over the point that they already say the pledge, they want to add it again. Imagine saying it before every class instead of at the start of school. Yikes."
noodlelein,They shouldn’t be allowed to hold office if they have no faith in the system
Marcusfromhome,Truer words have never been spoken.
vim0971,Damn right they should!!  Should be banned from office too.
RoachBeBrutal,"Well, he’s not wrong."
stabach22,Or probably banned from any sort of elected public office. I dont know. Just spit-balling.
HellaTroi,Matt Gaetz is growing a beard to make his five head less prominent. LMAO!
Im_gumby_damnit,Haha - that's awesome.
AnonAmbientLight,I feel like it’s not a controversial statement.
IsGoingTTaM,If we followed the constitution this amendment wouldn’t matter since those insurrectionist would be barred from holding their seat anymore.
StressedCephalopod,"First of all it's not surprising that people aren't actually reading the article, but: it's about inviting (possibly insurrectionist) CONSTITUENTS to lead the pledge.

Therefore the correct response is as follows: ""I'm far more concerned about the proven insurrectionists still sitting in Congress with no worry, tbh."""
HollyJolly88,"I mean, he's not wrong..."
Crash665,"Saying something as simple as ""If you attempt to overthrow the government, you shouldn't be allowed to say the pledge"" is ""***fireworks***"".  

&#x200B;

Imagine if someone had the balls to stand up and hold these people truly accountable and not allow them in the government at all, and even go so far as to throw them in prison."
Popular_Camel_5047,Why are they still in a government position altogether?
Experienced_AP,They shouldn't even be representing.
AbsentGlare,I’d really like to understand how dems let any of these fuckhead traitors anywhere near seats of power.
DVDClark85234,"Insurrectionists should be staring at the brick wall of a prison cell, not whining about whether they get to virtue signal."
aaerospace,Thank you! I want more dems to stand up and say it like it is. Why are they all not doing this?
cup-o-farts,"Fucking piece of shit republicans want to recite a pledge to remember dead soldiers, meanwhile they will vote against anything that helps veterans and gives money to the VA. Fuck these assholes."
Rikiar,As much as I agree with him. I'm so tired of performative politics.
ZealousWolverine,"""A failed insurrection becomes a practice for a successful coup if the culprits are not held accountable ""

Why are these traitors still holding high positions in government? WHERE IS THE FREAKING JUSTICE???"
Dr_A_Mephesto,Why. The. Fuck. Would. Anyone. Pledge. Allegiance. To. A fucking. Flag
nc1264,How can a traitor still serve? They belong in jail. Sack the lot and put them in jail for a very long time.
PricklyPossum21,They should be banned FROM SITTING IN CONGRESS OR RUNNING FOR OFFICE.
SeaworthinessOne2114,"They should not even be in congress, they are insurrectionists and traitors and therefore should actually be in jail.  They should be nowhere near our government."
mcmullet,How about insurrectionists should not be allowed to be in Congress.
Melodic_Oil_2486,People are angry when truth is spoken. Film at 11.
Hoobs88,Where’s the controversy on this?
petepostlethwaite,Can we just get rid of the pledge
AbbreviationsFair515,Totally agree can’t take the pledge of it’s not sincere
cmgchamp2,"Yes, it seems one of the Republicans on committee was fond of saying the pledge of allegiance in elementary school...and gee...wouldn't it be nice to do it here.

An hour's debate ensued.

Your brand new Republican leadership at work, huh."
The_Pandalorian,"Fucking love it. Drag them publicly and keep showing that the Republican Party is the party of cowards, traitors and fascists."
JohnOliverismysexgod,And certainly banned from serving in the Congress of a nation they tried to destroy.
Zarathustra404,Idk why they continue to let child predators like Gaetz be on committees. Oh right! Republicans made sure of it.
usedtobejt,"In 2023, I legit assume boebert brought fireworks or some shit"
Moonrak3r,"The entire pledge of allegiance is weird IMO. I used to live in Texas and they made my kids pledge allegiance to the state of Texas too. 

It strikes me as trying to brainwash kids in a weird and culty way, and the whole thing is completely ineffective at that anyway. Kids don’t know what they’re doing or why. It’s just a thing they’re told to do before they can get on with their day. 

Also: insurrectionists are bad and shouldn’t be involved in any part of our government, including this."
Btankersly66,How about they are banned from holding public office altogether. Considering that's what the Insurection Act states.
dansedemorte,Insurectionists should have been removed from office permanently.
HarryPate,"If their oath of office doesn't prevent them from trying to overthrow the government, reciting the pledge before committee meetings certainly won't."
scottieducati,They should be banned from holding any public office ever?
baddfingerz1968,"They should be BANNED FROM HOLDING OFFICE.

Then prosecuted and thrown into PRISON.

Whatever happened to the LAW???"
Soggy_Cracker,Insurrectionists should be banned from OFFICE!

bmhadoken,"[Ill just leave this here.](https://indica.medium.com/i-lived-through-a-coup-america-is-having-one-now-437934b1dac3) Seems topical, since we’ve spent the last few years watching our government begin to straight-up fracture."
GaiasWay,"Insurrectionists should be banned from office per 14A s3. They already lied about protecting the constitution and upholding their duties to it, what's a made up pledge to them?"
canon12,"Anyone related in anyway with the terrorist insurrection should be banned from any political position; not just the Pledge of Allegiance.  By not doing so it just opens more doors to attract the trash politicians...Are you listening Jordan, Gaetz, McCarthy, Green, Hawley and dozens more?"

Jo-Jo-66-,"Democrats need to call them out publicly every chance they get.  They have videos, statements , and direct quotes that should be pushed into the American media at every opportunity."
Pixoholic,He's got a great fucking point.
stclvr53,They actually shouldn't be part of Congress at all.
epicgrilledchees,Well. He’s not wrong.
jerechos,"Insurrectionist should be banned from office and be in jail.

I'm glad we drew the line at leading the Pledge of Allegiance."
DefrockedWizard1,Insurrectionists should be ejected from Congress
Happy_Heretical,Imagine a world where they just went to work and did their job
ivejustabouthadit,How about we just grow up and ditch the pledge altogether.
psittacholic,He's not wrong.
thefanciestcat,He's right to call out that insurrectionists have no business saying the pledge. They don't mean it. Attempting a coup because your guy lost an election is the polar opposite of pledging your allegiance to the Republic and that for which it stands.
autotldr,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/fireworks-house-democrat-says-insurrectionists-banned-leading-pledge-a-rcna68585) reduced by 79%. (I'm a bot)

> WASHINGTON - A routine House committee meeting erupted into a heated, nearly hourlong debate Wednesday over the Pledge of Allegiance, with one Democratic lawmaker saying that &quot;Insurrectionists&quot; who backed former President Donald Trump&#039;s efforts to overturn the 2020 election should be banned from leading it.

> It began after Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., offered an amendment that would give the committee the opportunity to begin each of its meetings with the Pledge of Allegiance.

Your new Republican leadership at work, huh."
BrokenInternets,Not wrong
crawling-alreadygirl,"I mean, insurrectionists shouldn't be in Congress. As much as I hate the phrase, this actually is virtue signaling. Who cares about leading the loyalty oath?"
sugar_addict002,"Maybe the Insurrectionist Congresspersons should have to say the Pledge every day and then take a test to verify that they comprehend it.

To them it is just words to use as a weapon."
insofarincogneato,I'm over here wondering why the pledge of allegiance is still a thing... If it's tradition/social rule to say it then it doesn't mean anything
CaPer0420,"Totally agree - should be banned from holding office. Win and it’s legit, lose and it’s fraud…brutal"
RedSpartan3227,"The Republicans doth protest too much, methinks."
wonkey_monkey,"> Fireworks in House

Maybe best to avoid this kind of metaphor. Especially with the word ""insurrectionists"" also in the headline."
ItisyouwhosaythatIam,Seems like the insurrectionist is the only one who needs to pledge allegiance
ting_bu_dong,"They should be banned from government.  Hell, they should be banned from our country."
abelenkpe,"They’re right. More, insurrectionists should be banned from public office. FFS why are they still in office?"
fubes2000,"All other factors aside, I think that the only thing that Congressman Matt ""Sex Crimes"" Gaetz should be attending a committee on is about Soap on a Rope etiquette during shower time."

CrisBkind18,They should be in jail! Not in office! what the hell is wrong with this country?!
PearlDivers,Leading the pledge? They should be rotting in jail.
First-Funnies,"weak tea

they should be banned from congress. imprison for their involvement in insurrection

instead we get they should not lead pledge of allegiance

rich white folk privilege"
KingLouisXCIX,Banned from leading the Pledge? They should be removed and arrested.
bort_jenkins,Throw away the fucking key. It’s absurd that these turds are still in their seats
PoptartMartt,Hes not wrong they're all traitors to America and should  be investigated
DragonOfThePit,... The pledge of alliance is stupid anyway. Being forced to say it in school is next to near cultism.
Space-Dribbler,Reciting or believing. Big difference.
Haunting-Ad788,They should be banned from holding office but I guess the that’s just a suggestion.
Richfor3,"It's hard to believe we even have a pledge much less it's some sacred prayer that all of our politicians say multiple times a day and force our children to say every day.  Very cultish.  

I for one would never say that prayer again."
BrownEggs93,That's the *least* thing they should be banned from!  That they are still holding office is shameful.  That they are still guiding (or whatever they want to call it) this country is a goddamn joke.
Kantsas,"This argument would carry a lot more weight if they actually punished the insurrectionists.

weed_blazepot,"I fail to see how this is even remotely controversial. Traitors and insurrectionists *shouldn't* be allowed to lead the Pledge, or hold office. I'd say that's pretty cut and dry - *and it's specifically mentioned in the Constitution these assclowns claim to hold so dear.*

I guess the problem is half of Congress self-identifies with that label. Interesting."

_R2-D2_,"I think my takeaway from all this is that instead of tackling important issues and solving real world problems, they are making amendments that require them to recite the pledge of allegiance. What a waste of time and taxpayer money."
Imaginary_Tone_6577,Every single congressman who voted to deny the state electoral votes on January 6th are insurrectionists. Everyone of the should be removed from office and profited from ever running for public office under the crystal clear language in the 14th Amendment. They showed destain not allegiance for the constitution of this nation!
tomismybuddy,">	Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the committee's ranking member, immediately objected, arguing that House members already recite the pledge on the floor every day. ""I don’t know why we should pledge allegiance twice in the same day to show how patriotic we are,"" he said.

Totally agree with this take."
,Pledge of Allegiance? How about not be allowed to be in office.
RDO_Desmond,It is correct to question the sincerity of those who were engaged in trying to overthrow a lawful election. This whole thing has been for the sole purpose of undermining our humanity and pitting us against one another.
FUMFVR,">Freshman Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, said he recited the pledge in elementary school and argued that reciting it during committee meetings is necessary because it represents the deaths of thousands of Americans

He is obviously saying he is a child. 

>  Gaetz's amendment, on the other hand, passed unanimously, 39-0. 

Proving that soon Congress will be pledging allegiance every 5 minutes because none of these people can have it on the record that they voted against it. A country of children governed by children."
Nodebunny,they shouldnt even be allowed in congress quite frankly. sad that we are at this point.

Numerous_Rope_9409,"remember the prosecutors probably won’t charge gaetz with statutory rape and paying for sex with a minor but they did charge the guy who taught him!

“ Greenberg, who was once considered Gaetz’s “wingman,” had faced credibility issues in part because of the massive list of charges he initially faced. Greenberg faced multiple indictments and a total of 33 criminal counts against him at one point, though he eventually pleaded guilty to only six counts. Those criminal charges included sex trafficking a minor, stalking and fraud. He’s facing a minimum of 12 years behind bars.”

concreteKorvax,Seems pretty logical to me. Insurrectionists shouldn't be allowed to lead the pledge of allegiance because they're all bent over for diaper don the patron Saint of sore losers

Alone-Charge303,"I mean, they should be banned from the House entirely, but that’s a start…"
frupp110,"It’s hard to lead the pledge allegiance to a country when there are literally so many elephants in the room that attempted a coup against it.

It’s also telling that when January 6th comes around it little like 9/11 in 2002 and 2003. It’s like, “are the terrorists going to use the anniversary to do something again?”, but this time the terrorists are domestic."
Nerney9,"So anyone else read this title and first  think some screwball Republican decided to \*literally\* light off fireworks as pretend gunfire after a Democrat started talking about insurrectionists?

david-writers,Party Member Gaetz admitted that the proposal would disqualify too many members of THE PARTY who participated in the recent insurrection.
