Sug_Madi,"I understand you completly. I am new to the game(bought long, started playing last week) and i came upon a cave, which was quite dark and full of poison so double dark with gasmask on.

Now, so far i have only seen standart hogs and like 3 standart spitters. I didnt know spiders were a thing.

So i went in, expecting some hogs or spitters, but it was clear. And then sudenly that thing spawned right next to me with 3 normal size spiders ass a back up.

I had the same panic attack, only with rebar gun instead of building gun and sprinted outside the cave as fast as i could. That thing followed me, so i killed it outside, but man, with headphones on, playing in the dark during the night and without any knowledge that spiders were a thing in a game, let alone that thing, my heart rate was throuht the roof.

I still get elevated heart rate when i see one now and goosebumps, when i hear another fking artifact."
