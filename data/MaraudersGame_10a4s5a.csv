CAPITA1g,When you Breach you are at a positional disadvantage and you lose some health. If you left a disabled ship chances are you took some damage on the way to the pods. Breachers are at a disadvantage and honestly I go for space combat to try to force people to breach me and it‚Äôs the best way to force pvp and get kills ImO. Best part of the game. The only thing that could be tweaked is how much damage you take and maybe adding 5-10 points of trauma damage
Pakman184,"Jesus OP, after reading all your comments here ive never been happier to just press the downdoot button on all of them. You're obnoxious lmao"
Hellcinder,"I love it!  In fact, I wouldn't mind more space combat type games that involve boarding ships and attempting to take over the bridge."
bSurreal,"Idc if people breach me. I want people to because I like PvP, and they're most likely gonna die. I've only died once from a breacher and it's when they were cheating. That being said, I think it's better for the general playerbase that pods can't breach ships until they're 50pcent destroyed. If I wasn't very good at the game, it'd be annoying to get instantly breached. The flaw to this method however, is lets say I'm flying out in my rustbucket and my ship gets disabled without me outputting much damage. Where do I fly to? The ship that destroyed me is full health, can't breach him. No other ships on the map? Guess I fly back to base. It would create a boring gameplay loop. I don't really know the solution, but hopping out at the start and instantly breaching someone is pretty lame"
scared_star,"Instant Beaching just ignores the fun weapons that we install on our ships, i rather damage or disable a ship then have a chance to board it than braindead rush to the pods,

Personally think there should be a system in place of if a ship is damaged more than 50% they can be breached, does not take in account of repairs. The people that own the damage ship is then able to breach the attackers and other ships as well. It at least prevents people from podding right away in a match and encourages one of the other CORE gameplay, the space COMBAT. So far its just a pod fiesta"
,can always count on someone with TTV in their name to have braindead takes
hector_cumbaya,"I think in terms of balance, I'm not rewarded for winning in space combat, I kept my ship repaired, but yet I'm still the one being boarded. The game is in early access so changes are bound to happen."
WiseGuye,I just escape in my pod lol.
HornedMaiden,"Boarding is a very flawed mechanic that makes the entire space battle part of the game pointless (witch is basically the main thing that makes marauders different). Why even bother getting better ship if regardless of who win or lose its gonna end up with one crew boarding the other?

I have to say I understood how fucking stupid it was when I spawned in a game with a enemy team running a capital ship.
Within a min of spawn, 10 ish pod were charging the ship.
The damn thing didn't even have time to do space battle.

I understand the boarding is a ""core mechanic"" but so is space battle, and one is killing the other."
Amaninthetrees,"~~Getting breached within 20-30 seconds of match start by three sweaty boys before you've engaged another ship is... wack.  
The mechanic needs some kind of balance to it. What that looks like is up for debate.  
Gatekeeping via meta on the part of hard-core players kills player bases.~~
Edit. Commented before seeing your other replies. 
Jesus dude touch some grass. Still using Beta as an insult?"
VikingHokieWork,"Perhaps if enough of the fan base hates it, then it won‚Äôt have to be a core mechanic anymore‚Ä¶. Imagine a business listening to its customers /s"
MaxIrons,"I think it's more that with the space combat / breaching / ship loss mechanics there's not a lot of positive incentives for a solo player to take anything other than the fuckitbucket on raids. The Red Baron and to a lesser extent the AI Inerceptor / Scout Frigates give a _negative_ incentive (you risk your personal gear more if you're in 'ole rusty against them).

I think the breaching mechanic isn't the best angle to approach this, at least not directly.  Though I do give props to the idea that the more armor a ship has remaining giving more damage, whether regular or ""white"", to boarders as an interesting stopgap.  When engines & armor mods come out I think these will provide the positive incentives people are looking for,  or at least I hope so."

bajungadustin,"I think you missed the part where you absolutely do not have to start a fight to get breached. Just wanted to point that out.

My big issue with breaching is the set spawn points. We got randomly bombarded by a ship we didn't see so we abandoned ship. 3 of us breached the same ship at the same time and came up in different areas. Where people were waiting ADS with shotguns. It was instant death for all of us. We didn't even have time for the smoke to clear.

So if breaching is going to be a core mechanism of the game and the spawn points for breaching are going to be fairly standard then they need to add stuns to people too close.. Or just straight up one shot them. There is no reason to be in those areas of the ship unless you are spawn camping breaches. Which there is absolutely zero counter play. Also it's a ship injecting itself into your ship. Seems like that would cause massive damage to anyone in the area. 

If there was a stun mechanic involved anyone too close to breach areas would take something like a 2 second stun. Which would make people stay away from those areas when they feel they are about to be breached. (you are not there normally anyway) this would put the breaching crew at more of an even playing field. They would at a minimum have time to ADS and look around. 

Otherwise the mechanic will get solved and people will constantly harass other players to get them to breach only to one shot them when they do. Which eliminates the entire reason for breaching. It should be crew vs crew not free loot."
usingreadit,"I mean I almost never do it üòÅ
Not sure if it is THE core mechanic
I mean sure it is unique"
OverlordZombwich,"The easy solution to this is making the boarding mechanic require player controlled ships to be disabled in order to be boarded. Problem solved.  


Would also incentivize space battles which are extremely lacking at the moment."
TTV_xxero_foxx,"Here's the only acceptable change to breaching I see:

1 - breaching should deal a stun effect or damage to anyone camping the breach point from inside the ship. If it damages the player it should have a negative effect on anyone in the immediate vicinity to balance the breach camp. 

2 - ships with heavier armor deal more blast damage to the breaching player. This makes sense because you're punching through a thicker hull.



But the idea that you should ""only be allowed to breach disabled ships"" or anything along those lines is just a plain bad idea."
ReallyGottaTakeAPiss,It‚Äôs pretty easy to avoid being breached. Either defend or hit the pod when you see em coming.
Kami-no-dansei,The funny thing is you CAN kill the players or seriously injur them inside the ship before they breach by still shooting it as its downed
wilhelmthe11,"Based individual, breaching is fun enjoy it, get better, and stop complaining."
StickyRibbs,A small vocal minority will always be crying.
PriorEnvironmental65,"Don't go picking fights.

Best advice ever.  I gave a wide bearth to two ships having an argument, got breached, killed breacher, got breached again, podded out, breached one of their ships, repaired it, got breached in that ship, podded out and it went on for a while; breached my own ship 3 times in the end, 5 in total.

It was my highlight of the game so far."

stickybible,"Do people really hate it that much? Me and a buddy I play with love breaching it‚Äôs super fun. Coming from Tarkov it really makes the game stand out from other looter shooters. And now with the bigger raid maps I find I‚Äôm less likely to be breached if I‚Äôm just going straight into one of the stations. If you stick around in space and get breached, we‚Äôll that‚Äôs your fault really"
Immortan-Moe-Bro,"I agree with you I think it‚Äôs a good way to balance things, personally I nope the fuck out when my ship is destroyed unless There is a merchant or capital ship for me to board. I don‚Äôt destroy people‚Äôs ships unless I have backup with me because I know I‚Äôm going to be boarded. It really doesn‚Äôt bother me that much."
eswareinedelweiss,"Simple enough, if you shoot me and disable me while I‚Äôm minding my own business flying to a dock. I‚Äôm going to pod to you and if you don‚Äôt kill me, I will run you over. No questions asked‚Ä¶"
ACESTRONAUT123,"For the people whining about getting breached, they need to stop using the rust bucket and get a ship with rocket pods. Half the time you'll be able to just kill the escape pods no problem"

appa_the_magic_bum,Flak is amazing against pods
,Man that down vote farming is incredible.  I enjoyed reading op getting owned repeatedly.  Pod breaching is such a shit mechanic on so many levels.  Think about it.  This ball of steel barely bigger than a human has infinite propulsion and completely slams into an enemy ship without doing any damage and the pilot survives? Like it's pretty shit tier.  Understandable that the parasites who get off on griefing wouldn't want it change.
SupermrCart97,"Tbh isn‚Äôt this game all about breaching like wtf is the intro video ending in? And idk if it‚Äôs still true but if you just keep spamming the disabled ship doesn‚Äôt it hurt the crew inside about 15 each shot so by the time they are at the pods they are hurt?
I feel like they guys who come out the downed ship are at a severe disadvantage and the defenders should win 9/10 in a breach."
