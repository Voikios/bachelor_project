skcuf2,That's one small step for humans; one giant leap for PMCs.
StealthCatUK,Same with flat tree roots on Woods. The PMC just won't fucking walk over tree roots sticking up 3 inches from the ground.
Lishak429,Should have gone to the hideout gym to loose some of those pounds. Fat ass USEC moment.
namrog84,"I was headed to an important interview the other day and had to take the subway.  Unfortunately, I was carrying an extra folder with some extra paper resumes with me that day. Despite my best repeated attempts and hardest effort. I wasn't able to step onto the subway. I was just 0.1kg overweight. I just can't carry much. I'm as pathetically weak as these Tarkov PMCs. I missed my interview and didn't get the job. :( 


Ugh I hate when that happens!"
Pedrofcc,*Veritas' video playing in the background*
WaZ606,"This clip has everything.

1.	Bad collision brushes regarding the platform to train.
2.	The awful recoil system, I could do you really wanted to just keep tapping but it doesn‚Äôt work. Ironically just holding down M1 is more accurate.  
3.	 a ridiculous amount of grenades landing at your feet at the same time as you receiving a shower or bullets. 
4.	Comments unironically calling you out."
pointy_pirate,"lol this really highlights the state of the game.

- horrible stamina system

- horrible recoil system

- horrible movement system"
LeSoldatRyan,"Nikita : It's a feature, will not fix that"
SufficientAd1490,"I like the toss the bag pack in the train comment. 
As obviously stepping in the train with it is counter Intuitive, not. Even if I was over weight I could do that step...."
,"god how am i glad that we at least dont have ""unrealistic"" call of duty movement /s"
forShizAndGigz00001,"Pro tip, look up, face your back to the train and turn around while looking up and strafing in, same thing works for hand rails that are just too high, practice it offline at the oli extract on interchange where the handrail meets the wall between the grass section and the truck."

aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,"Just toss your bag....


....so it can clip through the train....


.....and then if you go for the bag, you get stuck and instakilled when the train moves."
big-floof,"its actually insane that there are people here saying ""throw your bag in the train dumbass"" as if thats more logical than just fucking walking"
Not-a-Scav,‚ÄúRealistic‚Äù game..
BarmeloXanthonii,ouch
bikester1,Wow that was me that killed you! Yeah I watched it happen on my end and felt bad. After that your friend dropped off the platform right as I started healing and gunned me down.
jumpjumpdie,This sort of stuff seriously takes me out of the experience
Turbulent-Wolf8306,Hardcore realistic shooter.
pmscar,"This right here is a perfect reason why the devs not playing their own game is a huge problem. This is the kinda shit that should be fixed within months of beta starting.

This must have been rage inducing."
papalorre,"Also I forgot to mention my buddy the ""I can't help you"" couldn't help me because he was also out of stam and couldn't get back onto the train from the other side."
No-Carry-7886,"Reserve is the absolute most buggy map for me, the switch for D2 and hermetic when I flip them still don't toggle power then I spend the whole timer running around trying over and over to get an MIA or killed at train.

The extracts, every single one, are fucked."
jeff5551,Man this game is ass rn
fvckarchie,"I personally think, in agreeance with many mosin running naked pistoleros, you shouldn‚Äôt have looted that much and you were far too greedy. That‚Äôs why you died. You should have left almost all of your loot that you worked for behind so you weren‚Äôt overweight. Or brought in less gear so you don‚Äôt become overweight. Cause trained PMCs can‚Äôt handle 110lb of gear. 

/s


I‚Äôve been saying it for 3 years, the weight system fucking sucks."
Melodic_Obligation_5,"I love how the other team mate said ""I cant help you"" There are multiple windows on the fuckin train or anything else. The pmc playing could've dropped his bag and waited for stam to do the jump, but i will admit the tarkov dev's need to get there shit together with the preformance glitches, desync, rmt."
mr_trashbear,"Man, I wanted to play Tarkov, but seeing all these clips of basic ass mechanics causing death in a game where death means a huge setback makes me really hesitant to play the damn game. Like, saw a post yesterday that was all about some dude who kept getting slapped by desync and peekers advantage, and everyone was just like ""yeah thats the game, git gud"". Like, dafuq?"
Nickenord,Please mind the gap *train voice *
pedestrian_joe,COD has better movement mechanics thab this garbage of a game.

ChineseFood_Desu,I love that every video posted in this sub from now on will prove Veritas' point.
mrbawkbegawks,whats funny is my starting carry load in the marine corps was damn near 65kg for any more than a 1 day hike
Wolf10k,"This is and not being able to step over 1 inch tall objects absolutely boils my blood. 

Like I‚Äôm of the opinion that jumping and stamina drain should go back to pre inertia days untill BSG figure the fuck out how to fucking vault and step over shit. 

Like it‚Äôs literally not that hard. Yet they drag feet on every god damn feature ‚Äúbecause it has to be right‚Äù then it comes out bugged anyways ( looking at you prone lean)"
TheUltimateDoobis,I really don't get why this game is so revered. In every aspect aside from weapon selection and the core idea of the gameplay loop this game is not very good at all.
Pyramid9, the single fire recoils is the best part of the vid. gun bouncing like a jackhammer lmao
BeefyZealot,"Yup, happens all the time in that spot. I stopped taking train as pmc, stopped playing reserve and oh wait, I stopped playing this shit fucking game!"
qleptt,How realistic. This happens to me often where i feel like i can‚Äôt control my character right. For instance I‚Äôve died trying to jump over a completely jumpable ledge by someone just looking at me jump over and over again in the most embarrassing way.
Many-Arm-9804,Same thing happened to me the other day when I was super injured and had no stamina to run/jump. I eventually was able to wiggle my way in but was lucky there was nobody around to dome me.
SlavDawg,"This is only one of the many issues in this game that has been here for years.   


Go on factory and your TRAINED PMC will not be able to do small step on some concreet walls that are lying around on that map. That you would de be able to step on even if you had a 100kg barbel in your neck."
wxmco,"yea, that's a pretty shitty issue and should be addressed in the next small patch-it's been there since I started playing in January 2020."
BulletProofSnork,"Realism, baby! Don‚Äôt want no douchey CoD movement in our super realistic milsim game!"
PureRushPwneD,"This is so hard to watch... how is this enjoyable, BSG"
cousinchris1,That's tarkov right there. Dude can run down an almost vertical cliff face at night in the rain but cannot step onto a train...

Admiral_Thrawn_7,But COD is too unrealistic while tarkov isn‚Äôt
WAiiNz,tactical
BUNDLEOFSTLCKS,Tarkov'd.
RJohn12,Nikita/BSG will be like 'we absolutely will not roll back the weight system we want a hardcore experience'
HaZarD_SFD,Jump fatty!  (This is my comment every time a teammate runs into the same issue).
noahsark02,I am sure you will get lots of hindsight comments üòÇ hope you didn‚Äôt break your mouse or headset üëå

KniffelLive,Why did your shoot the stairs so much? What did they do to you?
Dirtydantheman95,‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help you‚Äù as he stands right next to you
VoidVer,"The best part of this is that he would have lived had he just stood still, killed the first raider and jumped into the train."
WARSAW4EVER,"This has happened to me  before as well, if you double tap z to throw your bag on the train, you can then walk on normally. It's some bug about being heavy."
Frickex,Ahhh what a classic. Gotta have Stamina and sprint on unfortunately. We‚Äôve all learned that the hard way
svvrvy,would dropping backpack help you get enough strengh to jump in? then pick up after?
DJJ0SHWA,Don't worry guys. At least we aren't like cod right?
Lanky-Structure-8838,Fucking stupid broken game
Technical-Oil4125,Should have dropped the bag inside then get stamina back
2manyoddones,"Shoulda threw your backpack in then jumped if you were out of stam, then just pick it back up once youre inside. Its stupid but i have to use it to jump out the dorms windows sometimes."
CorvusEffect,"Toss bag into train, enter, pick it up."
J3st3,Did you not know how to throw a backpack down? Lol
QueenAnneRevennge,"That's almost as bad as a particular wooden fence at Swamp on Shoreline. The one next to a spawn.

sando_commando54,"I mean you wouldn't of died if you killed the two other pmc's lol! Or you could of taken off the backpack next to the train, got on then picked up the backpack."
dorekk,So tactical. What a stupid game. I hate that I like parts of it!
not1fuk,This one clip highlights almost everything wrong with Tarkov at the moment.
Elli933,Aren‚Äôt PMCs supposed to be army vets? Like my bro can get both of his legs utterly shattered and shredded and walk it slowly off. But cannot pass a 30cm gap?
usherstin,"PMC are disabled lab rats that can barely walk,  are too stupid to sneak, starve or die of thirst after 35 minutes and taking steps is a big challenge.

This is the reason why EFT is ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù but pretty unrealistic. EFT is not realistic. Fanboys don‚Äôt need to argue about this fact because I also like this game."
Gloxxter,After watching some youtube videos of what real soldiers can endure and how far they can run with full Equipment i came to the conclusion that our pmc must be based on russian conscripts instead of real trained soldiers.
DinnerDad4040,Fuck this game. I'm uninstalling. I don't need to be tempted to play then hate my life 29 mins later.
YTmrlonelydwarf,While this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem and they really need to fix shit like this. If you drop your bag into the train you should be able to then walk in and pick it back up. Unfortunately half of this games skill gap is figuring out ways to get around shitty game development without getting hired and recoding shit
But-WhyThough,Most realistic shooter 2023
squirtle911,.... Just jump... Just.. just hit the spacebar.... OMG JUMP.
Modri_Kachon,My pmc dies of hunger and hydration while i can play airsoft for 4-6hrs straight without a sip or snack.
GrzybDominator,"I am kinda glad that I stopped playing this game. Don't get me wrong, I like it and I have around 1k hours, but that is enough. Got my money back with hours played."
Sestos,I assume you were massively overweight that is why you had no stamina at all nor could regain any. Did your mule or something run out while walking to the train?
adfsagos,This is perfect game design man. I don't get why you complain. Maybe you just want a twitch fast-paced shooter that let's you jump all around the place or an FPS game that actually rewards you for aiming properly like cod or some other weak ass game. /s
Lowpolygons,"I'll give you the benfit of the doubt, but if it says anywhere 'mind the gap between the platform and the train' then i'm going to have to take back any sympathy /s ( unlucky mate )"
cth777,"The awful walking collision models need to be fixed for sure, not just here either. 

However if you run into this again try walking backwards, and if that doesn‚Äôt work, dropping the bag forward in"
THEzRude,Oh its been like that since day 1. Dont expect them to fix it.
mudokin,"Sadly this is known to happen for a long time now. Best way to get in is indeed throwing your backpack inside and go in after it.
It's annoying but that's the way it has worked for a couple of wipes now."
Longjumping_Water_74,"you also freaking sprayed that guy and he was still alive, thats so realistic"
AtumTheCreator,Aim is atrocious. Perhaps that contributed to your death.

Seenot77,"""realism"""

WhoWont,All you had to do was drop the blue tape.
piningmusic,"the movement in this game blows, but i gotta be honest. not dropping your heavy ass bag on the train when you realized you couldn't get on without jumping was kind of brain dead"
IUpVoteIronically,The recoil system in this game is such dogshit üòÇ literally all RNG‚Ä¶ sick game.

maizelizard,"Drop the pack get in the train pick the pack back up. 

Just get good dude."
Dry-Let-2538,No hate but maybe because you miss 80% of your shot too
pjvanrossen,"No, you died because of shitty aim"
RoboticControl187,You died cause you didn't want to drop your bag to step over the gap. Don't blame the gap its your greed that got you.
ImSkiZzy,Not the only reason you died...
MrPatri0t,Skill issue. You missed so many shots.
SlothX0Xo,Skill issue?
CKosono,"I get the stress, but throw your bag down into the train next time."

Dramatic_Ad_2740,This is also not new information‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre that heavy‚Ä¶ you gotta drop something
Gamebird8,"As dumb as the collision box is... You stood in the open mag dumping a single target when there were two.

I'm surprised you weren't dead sooner"
Le-Misanthrope,"I know in the heat of the moment it is hard to remember but you can always hit your drop backpack key and it throws the backpack about 2 feet in front of you. Hop on and pick your backpack up. Scary, yes. Works, yes."
Suicidalskies,Looked to me like you died cause of the games shit recoil system.
Wide_Repeat_1738,Lol and i was thinking of checking this game out
P_f_M,aah yeah .. i always love when i take greedy friends with me ... they are so fat at the end of the raid .. that they act my insurance to survive ... i'm lightweight and fast... they are chunky and slow ... who is the better target?
BukLauFinancial,"hate if you want, but this game was more fun before weight and inertia"
FBTrueZombieKing,"And and as a 6ft 3 person in real life, sometimes you have to duck your head in door frames. Just because you probably are a 5 ft 1 smurfette does not mean it's not realistic ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Educational-Web-5787,"No, you died because you overloaded yourself and didn't hit the key to throw your backpack on the train so you'd be light enough to make that gap."

captwaffles27,Skill issue
Low_Morale,You died because you‚Äôre aim is actual dogshit lol
CeKanZ,Doesn't look like the gap between the train was what killed u.
electronicfixdude,"You were overweight in the red and couldn't jump. The reality is you should of dropped your bag on the train and then got on to grab it. Its risky but unfortunately its how this game works sometimes. Just work on iq moves. We dont just accept it, but we find work arounds because this is the only game that does this style well enough. 

Most of us want the game we started playing 5 wipes ago. We complain about wanting fixes and half the playerbase is delusional AF and its always get better and stop complaing, the game is fine yada-yada. Veritas pointed out everything wrong with this game and the direction its going. We want tarkov, but not where its going."
kit_carlisle,Dump some loot you goblin.
V_Energy,Have you tried hitting your shots? That generally helps
chiaros,next time do a quick Z drop of your bag inside the train to offload weight gotta play around the busted systems
storage_god,Drop ur bag
PhilosopherDave,"Died because you didn't drop your bag, step inside, and then pick up your bag."
Rasputin0P,Well now you learned that those steps arent walkable while heavy lol. You wouldve still made it by quickly dropping bag to get on. Just dont drop it through the gap
-Arbiter,Next time drop you bag into the train
PutridAppointment69,OP somehow missed 20 different shots and manages to somehow get everyone into circlejerking against the movement. You died because you‚Äôre bad at this game.

Epicpacemaker,"Yeah the weird lack of stepping over objects in this game is broken. If somethings below your knee level, you should be able to walk over/up it without jumping.

Maggiespharm,"I ran woods a couple nights ago and know the map like the back of my hand. Got some good kills and incredible loot. Running low on energy with no food, I was also overweight so I took breaks throughout to regather my stamina. Made sure to check the Evac points multiple times. Read them all out loud more than once to get it in my head. Stressing, I finally make it to my evacuation point on the other side of the map. It is then, I realize that the evacuation I was actually supposed to go to was right near where I got my last kill and decided to leave which was now on the complete other side of the map. I not only went to the wrong evac, I was also hitting the 1 minute mark, I was out of energy, overweight from all of the kick ass gear I worked very hard to get that raid, but I also checked my evac points throughout my entire journey to the wrong direction.
