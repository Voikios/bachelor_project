Maybedeadbynow,"Marauders is cool, but VERY raw right now. It has a huge potential. Hopefully devs will fix all the bugs and fix some mechanics."
METTTHEDOC,"Thanks for the love OP! Whatever others say, you are personally enjoying the game, and that's what matters. Cheers!"
BArhino,"I like to refer to Marauders as ""Tarkov lite."" Its definitely easier to get into, mostly for the fact that you don't have to worry so much about specific armor or bullets to pierce that armor. You can just jump in and start killing. Of course that's unless you meet some super sweaty twitch dude or something"
ncghost213,The audio is certainly better in Marauders at the moment
Snarker,"marauders is fun, but it is not even close to tarkov in terms of depth.  Marauders is like a cartoony shooter in comparison.

Team 17 is not the developer btw, they are the publisher."
PerfectAverage,"I would agree. I started playing Tarkov in 2020. I have a little over a 1000 hours in that game .

Sure, Tarkov has more depth. Sure, they are both different games. No one is debating that. I'd have to agree that, at the moment, I'm enjoying Marauders a great deal more. 

Over the last couple of wipes there have been a lot of small things that when added together, just make Tarkov less enjoyable for me. Marauders is in a great spot imo."
shashybaws,"They are different games in a similar genre. They both have pros and cons, its like comparing overwatch to tf2."
Undecided_Username_,"Couldnâ€™t read the whole post but yes this game stomps on tarkov already for me as well. 

Iâ€™ll never understand devs who prioritize simulating real life as much as they can. we play games to escape that shit, mean while I had to escape tarkov ðŸ˜ª

Not my only complaint with tarkov ofc and I canâ€™t get into it now but this game reminds me of when I could play tarkov and have fun."
nervouswhenitseasy,dark and darker is more fun than both of them. next playtest in 2 weeks
Legogamer16,"So you know, that banning without plausible cause in the TOS? Yeah every game does that. Thats always been the case"
realMartianJesus,No. 10 hours into this game and you will have seen it all
DJRobbyD,"Good for you that you enjoy Marauders so much. Not being sarcastic. I liked marauders for about a month or so while the end of tarkovs last wipe was going on also.

My problem is with you coming to another games Reddit to what, validate yourself? You played tarkov for less than a year. None of the things you mentioned should ruin the game for you. 

The new map is glitchy? It just came out, it's not optimized yet. Lighthouse was the same way. It will get there, the game is still in 'beta'. They aren't releasing finished products, they are testing and tweaking. You also don't have to play it?

 Audio is kinda bad, but not game breaking, and marauders audio is not much better even without the complexity of surfaces or covert movements.

Hackers are not a large scale problem in Tarkov. It's a reddit problem where people think people are hacking all the time and amplify nothing. I've come across maybe 2 times I'm almost sure of a hacker in over 4 wipes and thousands of hours. First day playing marauders? I saw a unarmed prisoner looking guy run super fast at me, threw some wires on the ground and then sunk into the floor. It's all anecdotal.

You're not getting banned from killing streamers. 1 person that happened to? They aren't abusing their power, they aren't breaking the game with updates... They are making changes that the community asks for and then complains about when they change them. The Tarkov Reddit is almost strictly complaints and hackusations. It's toxic af and doesn't reflect the actual state of the game, and shouldn't affect how you vote the game.

I like team17 also, but this game is so so so bare bones compared to tarkov and will not take off like we would hope it would. This genre is too niche and tarkov is too good to be overtaken.

If you like the faster pace gameplay with little to no stakes, on a game whose genre depends on the thrill of the fight and therefore the loot, good on you, but it is not better than tarkov by a long shot."
mightyapplepie,Basically tarkov for kids
Traditional_Band_419,"Marauders is great, but the stability issues could end up driving new players away. I get at least one crash a play session l."
