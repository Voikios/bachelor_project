dustofdeath,Be careful it's not the execute button.
Sir_Tea_Of_Bags,"For a second, I thought this was an edit of Destiny's Drifter, and I grew *very* concerned for the fox."
Forsythia77,"The DLC for Ghost of Tshushima has these chubby cats you can pet and it gave me massive amounts of joy.  

Conversely,  I never felt worse than when I was playing Assassin's Creed Origins and I accidentally poisoned a cat.  That little traumatic death meow when the cat ran up to me and crossed the poisoned body..."
_Mr_Cheeks,"Donâ€™t think Iâ€™d be doing this in Far Cry 6 with the crocodile. 

Fox, yes. Croc, no."
Lollomojo,This gif is pretty awesome!
Zero0mega,"If you put dogs in a video game and have no option to pet them, you have failed as a game developer."
SarcasticGamer,"In Sound Mind gives you an achievement that reads ""10/10 Game of the Year"" when you pet the cat. They know their audience."
ohmygodimonfire4,Good fox bois. Of all the awful people in this game I felt the most rage at the person you find killing foxes in that one side quest.
RatMaster999,"When the ""Feed"" prompt appeared near the nutria/giant rats in Far Cry 6"
guywithagun2,"*""ding""*"
Who_GNU,That fox is huge.
LightKnightTian,I was so excited when I noticed that you can pet dogs in Assassin's Creed Black Flag
JoshDarko,"Hive, bring a swordâ€¦ or a foxâ€¦"
skepticcaucasian,I hope Tears of the Kingdom has this. Those dogs and horses in BotW needed all the pets.
Good_kitty,so true.  I love the fox petting on this game.
mynameisimp,"Alright, alright, alright"
Raytheon_Nublinski,I tried walking past the dog in last of us and had to circle back. I thought I was strong enough.
macmynameismac,I think it would be funny if there was an option to pet most animals in a game and some were nice and some would bite you and take some health
gameplayuh,This was me when I was able to pet the animals in Pentiment
C_Tarango,"Fox : ""Please kill him.

Or me.

I don't care at this point."""

yaosio,"The Medium has a cat right at the start of the game. You can see it run into a room. You can follow it into the room and it's sitting on a couch watching you as you move around the room. You can interact with everything in the room including the wall. There is no way to pet the cat.

They gave an interaction for the wall but not the cat. The developers are monsters."

Salakast-1,"Imagine if Miyazaki added it to the next Soulsborne game. If you pet the dog, some terrible tragedy will probably befall it. Souls games are so depressing man."
JuggsGotchya,"Maybe not a 'new' game, but when I click on the starting scout in civ 6 I almost always have to stop and click the 'pet' button for the German Shepherd. Also I remember it didn't used to be a feature, great add!"
esinmuratt,I hate that prompt
