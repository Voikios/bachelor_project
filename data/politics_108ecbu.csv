Turk182,The GOP just gutted the ethics committee to avoid having to address these issues with its members.
Hip_Slick_Cool,"Brendan Fischer, a deputy executive director of the watchdog Documented, and Robert Maguire, a research director at the watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, both told CNBC that the actions could be seen as criminal conduct.

""A person who misrepresented themselves as speaking on behalf of a candidate in order to raise money may have committed a criminal violation, and any other person who knowingly and willfully participated in the plan could also face criminal charges,"" Fischer said in an email, per CNBC."
MoreStarDust,The entire system is a sham if this conman remains in office.
whatistheformat,"vote GOP, get catfished."
ToastTurtle,"Congratulations Republicans, You managed to get a complete con artist elected again. Interestingly Santos is even more blatant than Trump. Shocking."
crabussy,In the real world we call this fraud and theft
vegandread,"I swear to god this guy has to be a plant. There‚Äôs no feasible way that he is actually doing all this without it being some sort of stunt to see what he could get away with and still get elected to congress. 

In another thread I joked that this was all being directed by Sacha Baron Cohen. Every day that feels more like reality."
Phallic-Monolith,"He did call the GOP tanking the ethics oversight committee ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù.

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if this is some sort of art project"
aks59,"Please stop piling on George Santos, he's had a rough week. On Saturday his grandma died, and then last night his grandma died, and then this morning his grandma died ü•∫"
MydniteSon,\*slaps the trunk of the car\* This baby can hold so much fraud!
humbug77,George Santos is a new persona of Sacha Baron Cohen. Calling it now. This is becoming way too absurd.
Kotengu15,"I don't understand how this guy was sworn in. George Santos isn't even his name. NY elected a person who doesn't exist. How does this guy get to fill that spot?

And how is it not a massive conflict of interest and national security threat to have this dude serve when he can be coerced to vote a certain way or face prison time for fraud?"
Boxhead-1815,Isn't it frustrating how people like Santos can commit multiple career-ending crimes like this and everyone knows they will never face any repercussions for it
dun-ado,The US needs to purge all the George Santos and all his colleagues from government and society. Their existence make everything worse for everyone.
Dial8675309,"Has Netflix optioned this yet?

I can see it now: ""Inventing George""."
accountabilitycounts,Grifting on the new Speaker. Wow.
2_Sheds_Jackson,"Remind me again, exactly why did Al Franken have to resign?"
mkt853,"This guy is such a scumbag. Hopefully Brazil solves our George Santos problem. I'd be on board with a package deal: send him, Bannon, and Bolsonaro to Brazil to face justice."
hdiggyh,Lol this guy is terrible
OriginalCDub,This is just cartoonish levels of buffoonery at this point.
,[deleted]
I_Brain_You,"I think this dude (Santos) is a right-wing troll in ‚Äúdisguise‚Äù, and has lied completely about everything, not just his professional or educational background. I think this was a complete joke so he could get into Congress."
_SpaceTimeContinuum,"This is criminal fraud.  Santos should be charged and arrested, but he won't be because the DOJ considers Republicans and rich people above the law."
Dysc,How did this guy go from stealing checkbooks in Brazil and stealing/pawning his boyfriend's cell phone to US Congress (R). It can't be that easy. You just need to use your  meager campaign money to convince some rich guy that you're speaking form the office of the GOP House Leader? And to give you money to keep snowballing more money? Insane that we allow mechanisms like this and reward for it.
LieverRoodDanRechts,"The news here isn‚Äôt this Santos guy but how people are somehow surprised by the current state of the GOP.

How could it _not_ end in the shitshow it is today?"
keyjan,"Wait, what? Is this real? Can the guy *be* that stupid? And why did the staffer cooperate?"

old-hand-2,"‚ÄúRemember, The False Will Be With You, Always.‚Äù 

- Republi-Cant Kenobi"
cegr76,"The fact that the GOP is going to put up with this is still mind boggling, even after all these years."
Alex1867,The whole Santos show has just gone from being a comedy and crossed the line into criminal activity if this is true. AFAIK impersonation+grifting = crime.
Spin_Quarkette,"Yeah, and the House GOP is gutting the Ethics oversight group.  Just  in time for little slim ball Santos."
jsudarskyvt,Santos is obviously a professional criminal. He'll go far in today's GOP.
crlynstll,"Meanwhile, a Democrat takes a grape at the grocery store and Republicans lose their shit."
SirTiffAlot,"This mf'er man, what else is coming"
cmgchamp2,"Pretty funny that.

What I don't get is why don't Santos' own constituents sue to get rid of him."
Just_Far_Enough,Things must really be coming off the rails if ppl are using the politically powerful/connected to steal from ppl wealthy enough (or ppl that believe themselves to be wealthy enough) to donate to republican politicians. What a time to be alive!
Classic-End-5505,They deserve him.
sassygirl101,You mean FRAUD? He committed FRAUD?  Color me NOT surprised!
GarysCrispLettuce,"Holy fuck, Republicans are ripped to their scaly tits on the drug of corruption. They love it."
Dasnoosnoo,You mean the former Disney CEO and Undisputed MMA Heavyweight Champion George Santos was deceptive? Can't trust anybody these days sheesh.
Chemical_Knowledge64,"I‚Äôm gonna be brutally honest. We deserve a George Santos type after Citizens United. This is our biggest failure as a nation: letting the corporations, the billionaire class, and the special interests make the system in which we operate in and not put them down in their place."
marchjl,"If this man was a democrat, he‚Äôd be out of congress even if democrats controlled the house. We don‚Äôt tolerate this kind of corruption among our own. That this man was ever seated further demonstrates how few fucks republicans have for the law"
Jazzlike_Professor49,¬´¬†Fake it till you make it¬†¬ª political spinoff
ynwp,"I am kind of starting to like this guy, he is exposing our political system as farce. That nothing matters."

LightWarrior_2000,"Cool! He's robbing his own people and the Republicans will protect him!

Carry on..."
meyersjl30,I don‚Äôt want to hear a thing until literally ANYONE in the GOP is held accountable. This shit is exhausting.
zeno0771,"""You did WHAT??  Actually I'm not even mad, that's impressive.""

-- Kevin McCarthy, probably"
Forestbrews,"GOP: I am a Republican. But I am not a white nationalist. No, not a Christian Nationalist. No, I did not vote for Trump because I like someone who brags about having sexually assaulted women. No, I don‚Äôt think a majority of Americans that identify as democrats drink the blood of babies. No, I don‚Äôt believe Italian satellites were involved in the 2020 election. No, I don‚Äôt believe Jewish lasers started all the fires in California. No, I don‚Äôt think the 2020 election was stolen. No, I do not believe January 6th was a harmless party and I do not support the insurrectionists. No, I don‚Äôt vote for the GOP because I wish to defund the FBI. No, I don‚Äôt support violence against people who wear masks to protect me or other people. No, I don‚Äôt believe in defunding public education. Oh no, my party affiliation is not a reflection of my own character and morals‚Ä¶

Being a member of the GOP today requires a lot of clarifications when meeting a decent person."
J-Team07,"You know there is a screen-writer in Hollywood frantically writing a screen play to adapt this farce. The whole thing is a Coen Brothers film waiting to happen. Fuck it, at this point I‚Äôm not mad, I‚Äôm just impressed."
r1dogz,"How is this not slam dunk fraud and these people in prison?

glantern42,And how is this one not illegal? I'm so tired of this
banjo_assassin,Let me be the first to recognize the *presidential qualifications* for the GOP in this fine young maverick‚Ä¶
PopeHonkersXII,And McCarthy had just descended to a new level of hell. How delightful
NowThatsAnAdventure,Ouch. This may be the bullet that ends Santos run in office. Let's hope so.
psychedoutcasts,And nothing will come of this.
Comfortable-Refuse64,"Notice all these right wing tools use the super cliche steepling hand posture whenever they know the camera is on them. It‚Äôs like the non verbal equivalent of stating ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an alpha!‚Äù, which, as we all know by now, is definitely not ‚Äúalpha‚Äù behavior."
dobie1kenobi,As long as right wingers continue to be idiots with their money the grift will proceed.

BerryExpensive,Jail time for this dopey fuck

jkvincent,Just openly committing fraud now.
victorbarst,Bro this isnt even funny anymore what the hell is going on with this guy? Is he a comic book villain? Is he even from the planet earth?
paperbackgarbage,"> ‚ÄúI am not a criminal. This [controversy] will not deter me from having good legislative success,‚Äù Santos said. ‚ÄúI will be effective. ***I will be good.‚Äù***

""I will be good"" is basically what a nine year old tells their parents after they messed up but still wants a ride to GameStop."
Edmfuse,"Dang. This guy is like a Riverdale villain. More and more is revealed as the weeks go on about the things he did, and there‚Äôs no way you could see them coming because it‚Äôs so out there."
Ciburri,He will fit right in among his Republican colleagues! They should nominate him for a Chair of the Ethics Committee.
ZookeepergameOk8231,From pathological liar to straight up conman. Dude is going to get crushed.

kkeennmm,let‚Äôs talk about identity theft and wire fraud
PineconeFactory,He was just Kevin McCarthy ish. No biggie.
FrostySquirrel820,"Even if any future allegations are not true, there will always be suspicions that they are.

However, since those allegations are unlikely be acted on by the authorities, it doesn‚Äôt really make any difference."
Worf1701D,This guy looks like a sleazy movie villain.  Only thing is he‚Äôs real and this is not a movie.
TheOtherUprising,Just when you think this story couldn‚Äôt get anymore insane another thing gets added to the pile.

Cucumber_Basil,They should throw him in jail for fraud and then when he gets out they should extradite him to Brazil lol
evilninjarobot,Should be a top candidate for GOP Speaker in no time
AFQpro,Unbelievable! Republicans are trying to legally make the rules so they can rule the country despite that just based on the results only about 51% are the majority. But they haven't done anything about this conman who they allow to still be a Congressman simply because he is a Republican.
peterfrknpan,Slimeball gets worse every day

Zware_zzz,This man is a strait up con artist
FrequentAnnual1262,"The RepubliQan House wants to be just like the SCOTUS, completely unfettered from oversight or scrutiny and then they will tell us it is the most transparent Congress ever. 

Lot of doublespeak and jabberwocky.. 

BTW they are now saying they will ""talk"" with George Santos.."
LFCfanatic999,And absolutely nothing will happen because of this. This is who they are now and it doesn‚Äôt matter because they know their base will keep voting for them no matter what.
fdolce,For 100k he could have got McCarthy himself to back him!
HauntingSentence6359,"Santos will eventually be charged with campaign violations; the GOP House won't have any say in the matter.  Santos is a short-timer.  McCarthy will do nothing;  ""we're looking at this internally.""  McCarthy wants to avoid seeing his slime margin further eroded."
toobscreemer0891,Dude looks like the right wing Sinema.
ExpensiveMemory1656,"Get the staffer to testify as a witness, and allow Brazil to extradite, There are no recall provisions for elected federal officials in our Constitution. Our house and senate both have no established ethics as they want to cover their own a$$.

Remarkable-Rice4974,Some kinda sub human species these repugs.
DavidGlennCox,"And will the voters who elected George Santos, vote for another Republican anytime soon? Highly unlikely. Because Santos refuses to resign he‚Äôs rubbing salt into their wounds.
