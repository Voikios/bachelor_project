Cleru_as_Kylar_Stern,"1. and 3. are the same, as Dark Souls is a Metaphor for Depression ('Don't you dare go hollow!')"
HiddenChymera,"*Clears Throat*

Rock & Stone!"
DJDoubleDave,What about trombone champ?

ChristianLS,"It's more that almost all of the super popular indie games lately are in these genres.  If you can think of a genre or combination of any two genres there are probably at least a few indie games of that kind.  You could play indie games every waking hour for the rest of your life and never run out of varied, interesting stuff to engage with.

...I say as an indie game developer currently working on an open world survival craft game."
mindbleach,"Rogue-like means ""I didn't want to design maps.""

Source: currently putting off designing maps."
_Proti,"Stray? Outer Wilds? Deep Rock Galactic?

altho every good game fits into 3rd category when the credits roll"
BloodMoonScythe,"Might only be me, but im totally tired out of the Rogue Likes/Lites and Souls like"
TheOldKingCole,Clearly op isn't part of the boom shoot community.
Peter_G,"I have no idea why, but those myriad metaphors for depression are 10x better than anything coming out of the AAA market."
EeK09,"I got 1 and 2 from actual immensely popular games. Can you guess which ones?

P.S.: It's not a difficult guess at all."
Kasefleisch,"Don't forget the highly randomised, build-focused ""Only one or two inputs ""-Style games.

Brotato, magic survival, Bounty of One, Vampire Survivors."
demiskeleton,"None of them are roguelikes, just mislabeled roguelites"
Kaktuste,Celeste made me hate myself more after playing it
BeginningGas3569,"Back in the day it was like:
-Early Access

-Survival

-Open World

-Crafting"
Volt-Phoenix,You forgot charming little cute game about being wholesome
HeyDeze,Any game where you can die is a roguelike
Sorry_Village13,And in which genre would Stardew Valley be?
fupamancer,"wrong, but funny"
NoMoreGoldPlz,"There are more though. 

Like puzzle games, muscle memory games, point and click adventures, competitive online games, spiritual successors of iconic games of the past, including racing games, and probably dozens more if you're not as lazy as I am."
Spuigles,What about Roguelikes?
Quaaraaq,What about the super niche engineering games like from the depths
willis936,"5k updoots, 300 comments, no mention of undertale"

EnigmaNL,I'm so tired of roguelikes ans roguelites.
Whispering_Wolf,I like my indie games to be walking simulators with a good story. So... Closest to 3 I guess?
Mrrsilver,"You forgot the horror game where a bright character that's not scary at all chases you and hints at the game having lore 

Also selling merchandising as soon as the game comes out 

Coff coff... Poppy neighbor"
Picolete,"I just want to play a normal metroidvania, but almost always comes with the other 2 tags, souls-like, rogue-like"
TheCopyKater,Are all of the indie puzzle games also a metaphor for depression?
malibujukebox,"Hmm, It‚Äôs too bad that puzzle/platforming indie games are falling by the wayside nowadays, but they certainly had their moment. Games like Limbo, Fez, VVVVV, N+ and Braid (to name a few) really dominated the early indie days"
lizard81288,Where's farming?
ChaosMiles07,"You forgot ""Touhou-inspired bullet hells, with unnecessary retina-burning graphics"""
