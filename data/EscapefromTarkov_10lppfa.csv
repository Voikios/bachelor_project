ApeOfDiamondz,This post is like a honeypot for all the toxic people in this community
fpsgamer2,"No offense man, but I think it was the well-documented videos provided by Veritas, Trey24k, and Klean. I don't think they listened to the Reddit people, even the ones that provided proof via videos that the recoil was atrocious. Just IMO, I don't mean to downplay the effort."
turtlejizziz,Post history check out
Franklin_le_Tanklin,Yea. Screw those guys. I’m gonna complain even harder now!
HelloThere-66-,"Shut the fuck up, harassing the devs isn’t what brought these changes"
DaHedgehog27,"Lol what??

The reddit has no impact.. Nikita jus wanted some streamer ass."
cky_stew,"This post feels like mental gymnastics from OP to not only take credit for something someone else has done (Veritas), but also a justification to continue acting like a vile person on the internet, as evidenced by his post history.

Come on, man."
mastervodkaXD,One thing is bitching (this subreddit) and another thing is making well done feedback with actual research
Stanislovakia,"I'm glad for the recoil changes, but this post is incredibly cringy."
Saint0591,"Yep, fuck all the apologist idiots in this sub"
towhead22,Least self-righteous redditor
VanDeny,"You were probably the last person BSG would listen to. It was mainly feedback from streamers/youtubers that helped to push this through, those reddit cries were the very last thing they looked at."
Kielix,"""wah, YOU didnt do anything, veritas did all the work""

mind you, veritas has been bringing up the same issues literally for YEARS in the exact same long-form video format, but please pretend that all this happened overnight and veritas was the only person who influenced the recent balance changes because he made a video about it

point of the post was to dunk on the people who dickride BSG and hand-wave away any criticisms by parroting brainless phrases like

* its a beta and the game's not finished
* you cant adapt
* they arent going to change anything
* nikita's vision
* what we have now is fine, actually

which is 100% deserved"
MisterLisu,Tbf out complains dont mean shit. When youtubers started complain they did something. We been complaing since 12.12. 2 Yters made video week later we got a change.
Parad0xium,How did the community get the change done? BSG only made the changes when Veritas (a streamer/content creator) makes a video about it and then a few days later we get a patch for it. The community has complained about it for well over a year.
SpaceC89,"No worries bud,  whilst I do still check into the reddit I'll have you know my crops on Farming Simulator this wipe are well taken care of."
wonder1069,"Thanks because before the change, I literally lmao. I was in the army and the recoil from a M4AO1/249/M16 had better recoil than any weapon in Tarkov. Definitely not realistic. Also those listed were the first times I ever even handled and shot a weapon."
Livid_Tap_56,Facepalm
jnmann,I’m excited for a month or two everyone bitching about the return of the M4 and Mutant meta.. this community really is something else lmao
InertiaEnjoyer,"LMAO keyboard warriors did nothing, the streamers with a direct line to russia did this"
Ok-Street-7240,Watch in a week or so half the noobs will be complaining that recoil is too easy and they get owned
Buchmada,Bro homies post history has not one complaint. How you gonna take credit for something you had nothing to do with.
bbbevy,people in this subreddit smh
Plessume__,"Yes, the neckbeards on the eft subreddit that got 1 upvote per post really made a difference"
wallywot,The people that told us to stop should be forced with the bad recoil
Skoosti,"I hope you understand that it wasn't your mindless complaining that got through, it was the work of a Content Creator actually explaining the problem that got through. Just mindlessly flaming the devs won't accomplish anything."
culibrat,"You're bitching did nothing. It was was an impassioned video from Veritas with actual thoughts and logic behind it. Not ""REEEEEE gam sux now!!!!"". Don't give yourself any credit."
berationalhereplz,"Changes are changes… all it does is change the meta and probably more casual players are about to get dunked on. RIP to the SR-25, M4 is back."
RamenSommelier,"I'm going to bitch about these changes over the weekend when I'm getting lasered across the map but I'll celebrate these changes when I'm lasering people across the map. 

The old ""anyone I kill is bad but anyone that kills me is cheating"" mentality."
TheGobbler3264,Try having sex you dork
AftT3Rmath,"""AlL tHeSe fUcKinG CryBaBieS iN HeRe. JuSt gO pLay CoD ThIs GaME iS suPPossED bE HaRDcoRe REEEEEEEE"" *Head explodes*"
Lord-Rune,"They listen to streamers, not us."
Grimtrove,You are an insufferable person
Raikohhh,Many people don't understand how this reddit used to help BSG
TheJigglyfat,I don’t think it was the sub complaining that changed it. It was creators like Veritas and Trey who made well argued points in a video with examples and ideas on how to fix it
Y0cub,What if i dislike the changes?
sNiipp,calm down. it will be changed again. Its a never ending cycle
benjibibbles,Never stop complaining
WiseRevise,"Did you personally take the time to put a 40 minute video together compiling years of footage, knowing how things were, what worked, what didn’t etc? Did you send it to BSG? Veritas took the time to do what most people don’t, and that’s provide detailed feedback.

OR did you just make this post after literally not making a single post  with any feedback and a few comments complaining with no feedback? From a quick glance of your profile, this is exactly what you did.

You contributed nothing to these changes and this post is just toxic."
xTitanOP,CODkiddies think they got a win

paulmonterro,"Sure, they def listened to toxic losers who express their frustrations with the hate torwards devs in this sub every day, keep doing that fellas."
Arzzet,"You are like my ex girlfriend, you think other people do stuff when you bitch but the truth is it was to be done anyway, but at the right time. Balancing stuff and fixing is an ongoing work in development. Is like wanting someone to thank you that thanks to you the sun rises because you were bitching about sun over the night."
Albquehu3ur,Maybe some people just don't want these changes? It's not that hard to believe
kaibtw,Yeah fuck off pestily
Ovnii3,what changed
WingsOfWingsOf,Yup. We made a difference because we spoke up.
igg73,Thankyou so much OP
FaithlessnessDeep492,"What? Protesting something loudly actually works? Whudda thunk.  
People that say that complaining and protesting doesn't work are just lovers of authoritarianism."
No-Phase2131,Bad move of bsg listen to this shit
fratzi,enjoy getting laser beamed by full kittet chads
Levi31k,"U meant bitching, and I liked old recoil :c"
Electricklamette,“Y’all” ain’t do shit. Veritas’ 45 minute video did something. It pointed a finger at a lot of wtf is this shit about gameplay and realism. Trey bitching multiple tweets a day about recoil and answering every troll with honest (yes opinionated) answers did something.
,[deleted]
drbanegaming,"Bitching did nothing, all the people who showed actual comparisons and stats/research and had a well thought out constructive criticism is what got a change. The whiny horde does nothing but distance bsg from this subreddit"
snootsmagoots,Welcome for what. ?
sNiipp,they stopped comming to reddit for advice. not sure what this kindergarten vibe post tries to accomplish. just looks like you are trying to antagonize
WhatWeirdWindow,Just because they made changes that don’t make you bitching and moaning ok
anno2122,They area still right it took a streamer to complain....
EducationalProduct,"this is a sad day....


FOR MY HATERS"
GameQueazy,Stop complaining about complaining about complaining
reaperinio,"every streamer, youtuber of EFT has wrong takes sometimes. that was one of pestily's L takes. i still love this guy though"
Raiju_Lorakatse,Well I still complain. I think these chagnes go in the completely wrong direction.
Puritania95,Let the toxicity flow
KoreanKopKiller,What the fuck got fixed
radelrym,"There’s a difference between outright bitching and moaning about issues, and actually providing feedback. Almost all of these “voices” followed the first part and not the second. Get off your high horse and enjoy the game"
SnooApples2090,i think it was content creators and not reddit XD
ronintalken,"That's my secret cap

I never cared"
RoyalSquarious,"I think the real issue is the complaining is so negative and bitchy.  I agree with most complaints but posts like ""FUCK YOU NIKITA FIX THIS GARBAGE GAME!!!!!"" don't help and are going to be ignored by the devs.  Veritas showed how to give constructive criticism in a positive way that isn't so alienating and toxic and it was a tipping point.  Love how the changes look btw, can't wait to get home and play!

Edit: I do agree that for things to get done in this game streamers have to be the ones to speak up, sucks. However, I kinda understand why bsg has to ignore the complainers here, it would be too much to sort through all the bullshit bitching around here to find the real feedback.  If we as a community we're a bit more positive when we gave feedback we likely would see shit get done more often."
Kdj87,"It had nothing to do with the people on this sub. It was the high profile streamers making videos about it that did it. The devs ignore reddit, and rightfully so. This place is a cesspool of whining and shit takes. Quit jerking yourself off."
JebstoneBoppman,"lmao, this guy is using ""Us"" like he had something to do with Veritas's video."
MyHouz,"What I'm hoping is that this isn't just one change but the beginning of a larger set of changes that take the game back to a better place.

I feel like the wipe after inertia was introduced, where you could still sell most high-tier ammos and armors on the flea, was peak Tarkov. I'd like to see the game move back in that direction."
Leytarkhan,"The toxic overload of people that are here on Reddit that bitch about people wanting a better game is huge.

I will never understand people like this they are always that subset of people that dont care about the game and just spoon the shit every studios produce right into their mouths and get mad at other for having standards... or pointing out obvious flaws and problems..."
Longjumping_Water_74,"how is pointing out the weaknesses of a game thats in development toxic ? you guys could also just leave the subreddit if you dont wanna hear complaints about an unfinished game that is still in testing and need people to actually point out the bugs, glitches and ridiculous changes added to the game. If you wanna post your fun clips of you killing other players, just do it and dont look at other post from people that are trying to make the game better."
Z0EBZ,"It goes back and forth. At the end of the day everyone who disagrees on this sub is basically saying ""shut up, I'm right, you're wrong"" and luckily, everyone who doesn't break the rules can say what they want. And I'm here to say, never shut up, never stop giving feedback. Be mean, be nice, (don't fucking doxx or deaththreat people holy shit) but don't stop talking/typing"
sleepy_the_fish,"Lol. Unfortunately I think how toxic reddit is, BSG has stopped coming on here. Because we have all been bitching about this for over a year and ""the Flip Is a lie"" came out 9 months ago.   Klean saw the Flip is a Lie a week ago and personally sent it to BSG, and bsg watched and agreed.  Vertias video on stamina and other things came out almost a week ago as well and boom, bsg changed all the things we have been bitching for over a year about, in 1week.  kind of sad.   I think the biggest lesson to be learned here is BSG really needs to do things slowly and find a middle ground. People use a bitch about laser beams 24/7 and PSG completely reverted the opposite way. I think BSG needs have a community manager and bad manager sees what's the trending topics amongst the player base, and then there should be another community manager that talks amongst all the streamers and YouTubers and see what they think and combine both opinions and make subtle changes, slowly, until you find a perfect middle ground. Not do a complete 180 and then take over a year to Dial things back."
trailing11,Yeah bro making it so I can level up my endurance faster totally fixed the audio everyone was complaining about.
jcready92,"Something something complain, something something recoil."
ToiletGrenade,This is unfortunately what it takes to make people fix problems. I'm glad people stuck to their guns with the complaints because it's getting results.
Rude-Society-7622,ITT: All the delusional toxic community members come together to rejoice the changes they made to Tarkov
spamdatm4,YOUR WELCOME PLEBS! YOUR WELCOME. THATS RIGHT KISS MY SHOE.
HOU52k,HAHAH
Susp,"Those IRL raiders at BSG knows how to detect issue in their game/community, for sure!"
MagicMaleMan,Stop complaining intensifies
Sim-Hog,"It's actually really sad that it took a high profile content creator, who consistently creates well thought out videos that highlights the flaws in EFT, to get BSG to pull their collective fingers out of their collective arses to make the game ENJOYABLE.

It's really sad that those average gamers who have been saying the exact same thing have been constantly ignored by BSG. It really shows just how much they ""care"" about their community."
brycdog,Surely it was the redditors right guys?
bit32x,Complaining on reddit is practically pointless since bsg refuses to look this way anymore. Only people that read your complaints here are streamers and content creaters who you also hate.
V4ALIANT,"it wont change a thing for me, i'll keep clicking on heads just he same. Promise me you won't whine when you die to head shots every single raid. lol"
Dry-Astronaut-9479,This had nothing to do with you and everything to do with streamers. Don't congratulate yourselves lol
No-Pomegranate-5737,"I hate to break it to you, but you didn’t do anything. The streamers did. Developers only care about streamers and could give a shit about the others."
CeeDLamb,hypocritical watching two groups both think theyre right calling the other morons and idiots. reminds me of voting
EmmEnnEff,And next week you'll all be complaining about bushwookies lasering you from 70m.
M0NTY26,hope you dont break your arm patting yourself on the back
thebabyslayer,Now if they could just get rid of global stock limits
Solaratov,"Right? Feels good to be justified. BSG does listen, but only when we speak up together."
coomloom,I am going to violently shit myself
Shawzus,Veritas? Is this you alt?
spamdatm4,KISS THE SHOES. THATS RIGHT. KISS THEM REAL GOOD.
BetFit2122,Bsg has been caving to the community for years. Where you been at?
Rekyks68,"Pestily kinda sucks the more I watch and listen to him. 

Makes me sad"
SaviD_Official,"Pretty sure they changed it because all the streamers told them to, not because you and Reddit did. But yes, keep living in your fantasy where Nikita wants to impress literally anyone on earth who isn't a streamer"
DucksMatter,I’m happy about the changes but don’t get it twisted. We as a community didn’t affect shit. Content creators did.
lazy_elfs,In what fucking world do you have to come to a complete stop to ads….. fuck already
KEROSENO93,oh yes those that consider negative hype any criticism
jrocAD,"AMEN!!!  If you don't like it, go play dayz or arma, and STFU"
Lots_of_schooners,ROFL... Don't believe it for a second that this sub had anything to do with the changes
murderxxxx,"I was one of em..foot in mouth lol. I do love seeing this community happy, today. Very refreshing! HAhaha. In the end we all smoke crack and it's nice that we got a major rock today."
Splitdifferences,"Saying you’re welcome without someone thanking you first is like, seriously, on my top 10 list of signs that a person has a big dick."
Beaverlegions,"Thank you sir, you make me wanna unquit playing tarkov just so that I can come back in a week to this reddit to announce that I quit again.

So now what shall we bitch about the audio or the fact that BSG has admitted that their position is that cheaters are valuable members of their community (or contributors to their revenue stream) ?"
EternityZX9,"It's like maybe some of us who have been playing Tarkov for 5+ years and have been listening to Nikita and his vision for the game that long realized quite a while ago that the direction the game was heading was not what was he originally described and set out to achieve. 

Some times it's hard being so focused on building the future vision of the game that you forget to step back and look at where the game as a whole stands right now, and you forget why you're doing the things you are doing. 

That's the community's job to keep things in check.

And we don't have to be toxic about providing the feed back to BSG to make change happen."
the_th1ng,/u/shiftyslayer22 Can you show me where you have complained about any of the things that have got changed ?
GreyFur,"As an MP9 main, I have never felt the pain of the bad recoil."
MagicSceptre,"I couldn't really care for the changes, I'm glad everybody is happy but I doubt the complaining made a difference. BSG wouldn't have made the changes if they didn't want to."
tlrelement,"I love seeing pestily eat crow on this, his lips are permanently attached to BSGs asshole"
Seanannigans14,The initial kick of the recoil was bad but the rest of the recoil was fine honestly. But now everyone's gonna have lasers across the maps so this will surely be better!
TrigPiggy,It doesn’t make the complaining any less insufferable.
Mustangs33,They didn’t even change anything people have been complaining about mostly the last month. And half of the shit they have been working on for a while you think they just did it bc people been whining the last couple weeks
LingonberryLunch,Great job bud. You really can stop gloating though.
ProfetF9,the power of many.
sanctionTheOrcs,"vocal minority: cries for year
- nothing happens
Veritas: creates video
- changes got introduced
vocal minority: ""wE dId It""

Clueless fucks but enough with you, its time to prepare for posts regarding laser guns."
PolarPole,"To be fair, I hate anything that lowers the skill gap. And this recoil change does just that…."
TittieButt,"lmao, it's a miracle they even listen to you guys or the cringe streamers, but i'm glad they do."
SoNElgen,"You're kidding yourself if you think your personal whining had any impact. Unless streamers disagree with a change, it'll never get fixed."
BUFFWarthog,Imagine having so little going in your life that you're immensely proud of yourself for bitching online about a video game.....
_inertia_creep_,"Sorry, but, who are you again?"
HereFortheLulls,"There is nothing to indicate that Reddit bitching was consequential to any changes at all, and you should never be encouraged for being a bitter little dweeb.

Giant self-suck."
The_Suffix,"Yeah, so BSG came out and said they don't read anything on this accursed social media echo chamber btw."
SwiftBetrayal,Your voice was worthless. If a popular streamer didn’t pipe up nothing would of happened.
EaterOfFungus,"hate to tell you, but the years worth of reddit posts likely had nothing to do with it"
NabuBot,Big yikes if u think the constant shit posts on this sub had anything do with it. Sure maybe a little echo was heard but most of it came from them already knowing and working on and and content creators talking about it. Also it's nice to see that a year ago when everyone complained about moment for months till the obliterated it. Now everyone's hoo rahing about getting back some of it. Like make up your minds.
ARepresentativeHam,TYFYS
Key_Transition_6820,"Well there is bitching and there is creating constructive feedback. 

Bitching- I hate this and going to quit for the uptenth time because this that and the third.

Constructive feedback- The recoil system is to much to effective play the game over 20m. With the new audio changes although you can hear people more, you have no idea where the actually person is relative to the sound that they are making.

This is also proof that BSG devs actually listen to the community and not for once, again."
Sokaris84,This post is going to be hilarious when in 2 weeks time everyone is complaining about the full-auto meta again.. xD
Chindisery,"no you are wrong I will continue to settle for mediocrity from the product that I have paid for and I will continue to blissfully ignore all the issues with the game and I will call  you dumb when you bring up these very obvious apparent flaws

and then when the game does change in the direction that a large section of the ""complainers"" were asking for we will credit the streamers as the ones responsible for getting the developers to change the game

i am very smart and super cool and i have alot of sex; now if you don't mind i will now take my leave as i have to go give Veritas half of my monthly earnings"
BIGDongLover69420,Posting the same thing 50 times every week about recoil on the reddit didnt sway them at all lol. Im sure you will find somthing else to complain about in a couple days.
JJdisco21,Lol complaining did nothing. You actually think they whipped together patch specifically cause you said “recoil bad” on Reddit. Lmao so delusional
Jrmuscle,"Lol bitching has done nothing for these changes to take place. FEEDBACK is the word. Ever wonder why we don't really see the devs on here anymore? It's because this subreddit often fails to give actual useful feedback and just moans about everything. It's annoying af to most, I imagine it's mentally exhausting to BSG.

You have a problem, help find a solution with your brain instead of just saying things like ""FIX THE RECOIL WAAAAAAAAA""

Okay I'm done complaining sorry"
BackFromMyBan,What type of person actually makes this post? What type of person comments on it…hmmm
ThatGodDamnGinger,"TBF there is a difference between genuinely constructive or even neutral criticism (think the veritas video) and the absolute a-holery whiny entitled bitching that this reddit devolves into.

Don't think people ever have an issue with the first.

And the first is usually what leads to these kinda changes."
Stase1,Damn y’all really think you’re the heroes when you complain about recoil huh?
Gloomy-Mongoose-6827,Wow congrats you begged the devs till they made the game easy enough for you
Accomplished_Lack_61,for what for the idiots complaining 5 days from now for laser beams and 60 ammo magazines?
IanMinch,"They didn't listen to you. They don't give a shit about reddit, nor should they.

They cared about constructive criticism and well made video with tons of research behind it. If you think the toxic posts helped you are dead wrong.

""Without our voices"" give me a fucking break."
SAKilo1, The devs don’t look at this sub reddit. That’s a known thing. Your voices didn’t do shit
NervousQuail179,Do humanity a favor and stop bitching. Your whining did nothing for these changes lmao
Noswad_gaymer,Probably isn’t just about people complaining it most likely was largely about Veritas’s new video it’s had a lot of good arguments half of which I’ve never heard
