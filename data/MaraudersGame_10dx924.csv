axempurple,Actual player or npc? Npc ships fully heal while taken over and i don't think npc's die while on board
ShamrockJesus,"Are you sure it wasn't an NPC scout frigate? If there was loot where you would find the starting gear in a rust bucket then it was NPCs.

They won't die to shooting the ship over and over and the shipp is fully healed once you kill them all"
mightEmac,"Fire extinguishers, and a LOT of meds on hand.  Lol, I did this to someone but not with uzi. Was able to wait them out, and boom easy frigate."
bSurreal,"It's a visual bug. When you board a destroyed ship, it appears at 100pcent but it's actually at 0. One tap of the fire extenguisher will fix the bug. Dunno about the player, possibly a Marauder that breached just before you?"
Cm_west,"Buddies and I did a run where I would go and steal extra fire extinguishers. That being said it still took quite the upkeep and I wasnâ€™t able to keep us at 100%

Could have been that someone else boarded and grabbed the flight controls. This would put the ship back to 100"
Vahagn323,Dsync.
l3lNova,Lots of healinf
Blake_Aech,"It was definitely an AI Scout Frigate.

The AI do not take damage from ships shooting.

I have bombarded plenty of AI Scout Frigates and Interceptors, the AI inside do not die from damage done post ship kill.

They have to be manually dealt with.

The 100% health is just a visual big when you breach a ship, it is pretty common. Use the fire extinguisher on the engine for 1 second and it will say 1% instead."
nervouswhenitseasy,lack of answer from op is weird. why even make the post??
muaddib0308,I had this same thing happen to me.  Me and a friend had 2 shups and each bombarded a third ship with 50 plus full volleys just to board and find a playerfully kitted stormtrooper style....no wayyyyy
