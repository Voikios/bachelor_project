SlashingSimone,"Female gamer perspective. My husband never gives me any grief if I decide to game. He does not care if he goes to bed earlier if I decide to have a late gaming session. 

Mind you I only game at night once all chores/kids are taken care of. He just does his own thing, does his hobbies etc. 

He is fine with being woken for a quickie before sleep. 

Why women give men who game so much grief, I will never understand."
