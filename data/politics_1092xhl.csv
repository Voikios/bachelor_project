romacopia,Because there's no reason to think they're impartial. It'd be impossible to make that argument given the changes made and the politics involved in appointing them.
downwardspiralstairs,"Oh, were we supposed to believe that it's impartial?"
2FalseSteps,They're not wrong.
SmackEh,When the wife of a Supreme Court Justice attends an insurrection and that guy doesn't recuse himself from the case.. that'll do that.
was_and_wasnt,"Yup.  When repubs (specifically Senator McConnell)  used dubious morals to stack the court, many of us feared the court would tilt towards the more insane elements of the Right.  When the court overrode Roe and stopped the rights of half our population, what we feared became reality.  This court is not only politically partial, it is essentially immoral."
Future_Dog_3156,I am old enough to remember a time when the SCOTUS was an esteemed institution. I no longer believe that. I think the first step was Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings with Anita Hill. Then there was Mitch McConnell's unwillingness to confirm Merrick Garland.  We went off the ledge with all the Trump appointments. I think I'll be dead before their credibility is restored.
Plainchant,"From column:

Never in recent history, perhaps, have so many Americans viewed the Supreme Court as fundamentally partisan.

Public approval of the nine-justice panel stands near historic lows. Declining faith in the institution seems rooted in a growing concern that the high court is deciding cases on politics, rather than law. In one recent poll, a majority of Americans opined that Supreme Court justices let partisan views influence major rulings.  

Three quarters of Republicans approve of the high court’s recent job performance. But Democrats’ support has plummeted to 13 percent, and more than half the nation overall disapproves of how the court is doing its job. 

Public support for the high court sank swiftly last summer in response to Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a landmark ruling that revoked a constitutional right to abortion. The decision delighted many conservatives but defied a large majority of Americans who believe abortion should be legal.  

Yet, partisan anger runs deeper than Dobbs. Liberals are fuming about a confluence of lucky timing and political maneuvering that enabled a Republican-controlled Senate to approve three conservative justices in four years, knocking the panel out of synch with the American public."
Fit-Firefighter-329,They've taken up a case that could make strikes illegal - just one.more step towards Fascism.
King_Kingly,They couldn’t give a shit what the public thinks.
DAGCRO,Can't imagine why.
databacon,Only since they very literally stole the presidency in 2000.
insomnia99999,Because they’re not.
BinomialNamerator,"How's that legacy you were so worried about, Chief Justice John Roberts?"
heelspider,"> The Left was used to, for the most part, getting its way with the court,” said John Malcolm, a senior legal fellow at conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation.

Is he referring to the 1940s?"
StThragon,"Hmmm, I can only wonder what could have possibly given them that thought. Anyways, it's been how I felt ever since Mitch McConnell violated my Constitutional Supreme Court pick with Obama. I vote for presidents with the Supreme Court on my mind, and this violated any pretense of fairness and impartiality.

Obama had about eleven months left of his presidency when Scalia died and they didn't hold a hearing, saying it was too close to the election. Then Ginsberg dies with four months left in Trump's presidency, and suddenly the Senate decides it can easily seat her replacement. Yeah, the Supreme Court is heavily compromised.

edited for a word"
BillySlang,"We had an attempted coup with the wife of a Supreme Court Justice, not only in the middle of it, but actively aiding it, and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. The Supreme Court has lost all impartiality."
Try040221,"22% of 330 million Americans identified as Catholic.


78% of SCOTUS (7 out of 9) identified as Catholic."
The_Revival,"""Believe"" is a generous word. I don't ""believe"" the sky is blue."
nykiek,It's quite clear the conservative justices have an agenda.
sortofpresent,The Supreme Court has convinced the American public through their own actions actions that they are not impartial.
johnnybiggles,"I'll say it once again:  

> **Roe was an [unpopular decision](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/08/29/u-s-public-continues-to-favor-legal-abortion-oppose-overturning-roe-v-wade/) made by an [unpopular Supreme Court](https://news.gallup.com/poll/354908/approval-supreme-court-down-new-low.aspx) packed with the nominees of [unpopular presidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote#Comparative_table_of_elections) who were confirmed by an [unpopular Senate](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx) led by an [unpopular Senate majority leader](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/538518-majority-of-kentuckians-disapprove-of-mcconnells-job-in-senate/) who is part of an [unpopular party](https://news.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx) in an [unpopular Congress](https://news.gallup.com/poll/389096/congressional-approval-sinks-democrats-sour-further.aspx).**  

What could go wrong? ^^^/s

A previous comment here to expand on this:  

Two very obviously telling stats I always resort to are as follows:  

- Republicans haven't won the popular vote to become president since 1988; 34 years ago, and he was a one-term president  

- The current Supreme Court is a reflection of how unrepresentative and unfair the rule of law and federal government overall is:  

 - 6 of the 9 Supreme Court seats are filled by conservative-appointed justices.  

 - 5 of those 6 justices were appointed by presidents who *lost* the popular vote to become president.  

 - 3 of those 5 justices were appointed by a president who not only lost the popular vote, but was impeached twice and has been documented by multiple investigative authorities as being helped into office by way of Russian efforts.  

 - 1 of the 6 willfully accepted his appointment into a vacancy intentionally held open by the Republican Senate majority leader who blocked the opposing party's 1st and only presidential nomination, citing an upcoming election ""to let the people decide"", which was 237 days out.  

 - the 6th conservative justice was nominated 35 days before the 2020 election, the shortest period of time between nomination and the next presidential election in US history.  She was confirmed only 8 days before the election.  She also willfully accepted her nomination by an already impeached president who went on to become a twice-impeached president following her appointment that took place before the election he lost.  

 - The only 1 of the 6 conservative appointed justices who *was* appointed by a Republican president who won the popular vote was credibly accused of sexual misconduct before being confirmed, and he is not the only one of the 6 to be.  He is also currently under scrutiny for his wife's role in an insurrection and his own dissent on a case involving her role.  

 - All 6 are members of The Federalist Society, a conservative organization known to have [associations with dark money](https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/speeches/the-scheme-speech-5-the-federalist-society) and vast influence in conservative politics.  

- An unprecedented leak that still goes unresolved preceded the overturning of Roe v Wade, removing major rights from Americans for the first time in roughly 50 years, and going against several of the prospective justices' positions during confirmation hearings.  

The [Senate is undemocratic](https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2070&context=concomm) - it's the most powerful body of government and does not represent the people fairly, or at all.  Yet it's entirely responsible for the second bullet point, among other things, and nearly all policy."
R3miel7,Never has been
chunkerton_chunksley,They lied under oath about roe. It was settled law until it wasn’t. Of course they’re impartial three of them were sat by a traitor another is married to one.
Jagasaur,"At the age of 35, I only realized in recent years just how powerful SCOTUS is. Being able to change laws with the stroke of a pen when you can hold your position for 40 years is so damn dangerous in hindsight."
a-really-cool-potato,"It *objectively* is not impartial, so of course the public is going to arrive at that conclusion"
PicassosGhost,That’s because it’s not.
wytewydow,"The United States has been replaced by a soft theocracy, and it's getting stronger every single day. The religious minority has a stranglehold on our nation."
Wild_Guess_7402,Because it’s not lol…it’s all about ideology now and not the law or it’s ramifications.
cycko,"Not even from the US and it's clear as day that it's not impartial.

But was it ever, considering it is always politically appointed judges?

Maybe it's just MORE partisan now than it was, but I dont think you can say its ever been truly impartial seeing as they're politically appointed judges"
Inaspectuss,"Never fails to amaze me how this sentiment has only really become widespread over the past ~4 years.

SCOTUS showed its true colors in Bush v. Gore and it has been a downward spiral since. Not to say SCOTUS has not made horrific, backwards decisions throughout time, but there has been a consistent pattern over the last 20 years that has seemingly flew under the radar until very recently."
VibeComplex,It’s almost like they are blatantly partisan or something
409024072546630,"The court has become an activist court. Not just an impartial one. 

The media always seeks to present a sense of normality even when things are completely abnormal."
RoundTableOfGentlemn,Did anyone ever think that?
BearDen17,Hard to argue otherwise.
Responsible_Meal,Of course the public doesn't. The court is absolutely biased. It's a disgrace.
thatonesmartass,Could have something to do with the conservative political activists that sit on the bench
sneakysnake128,"If all legal avenues are exhausted, what's left?"
Gaius_Octavius_,Is this poll from 2000 when they picked the President?

Johnny_B_Asshole,"And in other news, the sky is blue and grass is green."

81FXB,Why do you think it matters to the political parties whether a judge is from the Democrats or the Republicans ? Because they are not impartial !
StumpVanDerHuge,"That's your legacy, John Roberts. Cheers!"
mike_blenderface,"They were appointed on purpose specifically to enforce conservative viewpoints.  That is an objective, known fact, not a belief."
thenewredhoodie,The American public is correct. Good job guys.
AbeRego,"The nomination process was a joke under Trump, and Clarence Thomas' wife helped in an attempted coup. Oh yeah, and Trump likely threatened Breyer in order to get an additional appointment during his term. How could we possibly think it's impartial?

Edit: typo

Edit: oh yeah, and Mitch Tits McConnell held up the nomination of a qualified judge for almost a year so that his treasonous shill of a president, who lost the popular vote by ***millions*** could steal the pick. The court is essentially a sham."
Jingtseng,I no longer think they are competent.
johnn48,"What was most troubling was the undue partisanship of the nomination process. McConnell used spurious reasoning for denying Merrick Garland’s nomination and then jammed through Amy Barrett’s at the last minute ignoring his own reasoning for denying Garland’s nomination, essentially packing the Court ideologically."
Suzzie_sunshine,"When the wife of a SCOTUS judge is caught trying to overthrow the government with other high level officials and nothing happens, it's hard to imagine there is any impartiality, especially when three justices were replaced by a president that lost the popular vote. 

The pigs are standing on their hind legs and rewriting the rules on the wall. There simply is no legitimacy."
the_deputy12,Supreme courts job is to rule on the constitution. Not public opinion.
,That would be because they make it VERY clear that THEY’RE NOT
Livelih00d,Why did anyone think they were impartial before? It never had been.
TeddyDaBear,"> The American public no longer believes the Supreme Court is ~~impartial~~ legitimate

FTFY"
Soggy_Midnight980,"After Trump installed the religious zealots, how could anyone pretend it’s impartial?"
Stonecutter_12-83,"They lost impartiality when Republicans refused to elect any democratic picks AND then lowered the required to a simple majority. 

Republicans prove over and over again to break their own rules just to gain control"
dixie12oz,Wonder why. Surely nothing to do with them going down the conservative wishlist at break neck speed throwing out years of precedence with flimsy to no reasoning. Seems like a very impartial thing to do.
Fynn_the_Finger,"Uh oh, the American public is crossing Alito's line!"
ScurvyDervish,"Humans are not impartial.  Institutions are not impartial.  The issue is that the Supreme Court of the past had made things more fair, to grant opportunities to people to live their best lives.  Now the Supreme Court wants there to winners and losers in the life.  And the want the winners to keep winning and the losers to keep losing."
The_Scyther1,When you lie on the stand about your beliefs and then strip women of their civil rights that is bound to happen.
orcusporpoise,Because it isn’t.
,Shocked pikachu face lol
GroundTruth01,"The Supreme Court has never been partial and its great that people have finally caught on. Rules of interpretation and precedent are constantly manipulated by the courts to decide a case, not by merit and facts, but rather whatever the judges want."
sauceymama,Because they're clearly not impartial.  They've become the GOP's lap dogs.  It's depressing that we're stuck with them for the foreseeable future.
4GDTRFB,Because it’s not and they’ve shown us this much
photowhoa123,It’s not…
Neil_Fallons_Ghost,"The Heritage Foundations cackling intensifies. The Koch brothers organization cackling intensifies. 

Corporatism, Oligarchy, Religious Fascism."
Lucachu777,"This isn’t news, we learned this when they overturned Roe v. Wade."
Misterfahrenheit120,"I mean, no shit?

Literally nothing in government is impartial.

If you’re only realizing this because of Dobbs… maybe you’re in a bit of a bubble"
timothypjr,Gee. I wonder why.
b-macc,That’s because it isn’t.
Chimalez,I wonder why they could possibly think that?
YWxpYXMw,"But if you pack it with a bunch of liberals, it would totally be impartial."
gentlechin,"Because it isn’t. What made the Supreme Court impartial was the 4-1-4 split it had across judges, so that each view point could be discussed and considered. Any ruling that came out of that court I had faith in.

There is no way anyone is going to convince me that a 6-3 split is good for the country."
RudePCsb,"Well yea, when they put 3 conservative judges, that were very religious, it changed the landscape extremely away from balance and reason. The one thing I always appreciated about the SC was reading all the cases that became precedent and were argued on rational grounds rather than hate and greed. Now it's just corporations and what their religion agrees with."
DeathsPit00,They're not. They're bought off just like every other politician in existence.
__Funcrusher__,"15 years ago as a British student studying American politics, I was taught that the supreme court was heavily politisized - a constant battle for a  conservative or liberal majority based on the appointment of (literal) politicians. Did Americans believe it was an impartial institution back then, and if so why?"
sarathepeach,"Not only impartial, but the length they go to in order to justify their decisions is unbelievable and inhumane. Citing centuries old jurisprudence such as how Dobbs was argued in order to rationalize not only abortion rights, but laid the groundwork to overturn other settled law such as Loving and Obergefell."
fifthstreetsaint,"Gee, maybe if they didn't pull their fascist judges DIRECTLY from cults like the FedSoc & ""People of Praise"", citizens would be more easily fooled by the obvious move to take away our rights."
Sashley12,Anyone appointed by Trump should be removed from office.  Sucks for them
Kimmm711,The Supreme Court overstepped by overturning Roe v. Wade. The institution is obsolete & should be dismantled.
_danbro_,"That's because they're not. 

It was the GOP's long-term goal, and they succeeded. Source: Mitch McConnell"
CommonplaceCommotion,"Impartial or not, the American public has come to realize that politicians AND the Supreme Court, do not operate with the People’s best interests at heart."
schrodingersmite,"If I can predict with great accuracy how a Justice will vote by knowing who nominated them, it ain't impartial."
slowfadeoflove0,"Impartial, or indeed, legitimate"
fried_duck,Because they’re objectively not. Even their behavior outside the court would lead you to that conclusion.
zanderkerbal,Brett Kavanaugh perjured himself during his own confirmation hearing by lying to downplay his history of working closely with the Republican Party. It hasn't even been pretending to be impartial since 2018.
TruthStriking1022,It's pretty obvious !
fvillion,The makeup of the current court is not the least of Trump's assaults on the fabric of our country
NanaBananas64,I don't believe in SCOTUS ability to be unbiased. Especially now they are party and personally driven. I don't think they should get a life long appointment and citizens should be able to vote who gets the position
hd016,People with uteruses: yeah duh
DirkDiggyBong,"Not surprising, considering it's fundamentally a political body."
Ibringyouasong89,I wonder what gave it away…
houseman1131,Biased judges hired because of the federalist society
dreddedexistence,They make it quite obvious
highliner108,"What, the small group of rich people who have more or less unchecked power and aren’t elected aren’t impartial? Who could have guessed!"
DemiMini,It's a MAGA court and MAGA are traitors
HungryApeSandwich,Once abortion was thrown out and they set out a full fence three times higher than the capitol had on January 6th to defend themselves should have been the wake up call that they were impartial. They had the whole police force guarding the supreme court that day as well. They know what they are doing and they understand they are destroying American lives.
CirocObama97,"I mean when you pass laws based on your religion (Christianity) and your religion alone, ofc it seems biased"
haunted_tuna,Do you think that possibly has something to do with they are no longer a body of impartial judges but in fact have political agendas?
ChaosKodiak,Well duh. They aren’t impartial. The killing of Roe vs Wade showed that. The justices don’t uphold the law. They uphold their beliefs.
TheRobsterino,"Because they're not. They schemed and scammed their way to nominating a right-wing majority. Those nominees promised - up and down, day after day - that they weren't partisan and were going to keep things running as they always have been.

Then they immediately fucked over women by overturning Roe vs Wade - a specific example they said they were *not* going to do - and telegraphing that they were going to keep up the hardline conservative bullshit in their opinions.

SCOTUS needs some fucking term limits."
EusebioFOREVER,"move this poor excuse of a court out of Washington. put them in a poor city. Expand the ""court"" to 50 members. Mandatory IRS and security audits. Let each case be heard by randomized 11 members or an odd numbers. Let the voters choose chief justice every 5 years. REFORM IT!"
almightywhacko,Only because they've demonstrated that they are not. They've also shown that they are 100% OK with lying to further a conservative agenda that is unpopular with the majority of Americans.
dortdog75,"They haven’t been for a long time. They are beholden to corporate interests, just like most of our politicians."
JimWilliams423,"The truth is that, except for the 15 years or so when Earl Warren was the chief justice, the supreme court has *always* been a conservative, if not reactionary, institution.   For example FDR had to threaten them with court expansion to prevent them from dismantling the New Deal.   Or back in 1881 when they twisted the 14th amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship to create corporate personhood based on [a lie they knew was a lie.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/03/corporations-people-adam-winkler/554852/)   And then of course there are heinous rulings like Dred Scott (black people are not citizens) and Korematsu (putting American japanese in concentration camps).

The mistake liberals made was trying to defend the rulings of the Warren court as impartial instead of simply saying ""these are good, *principled* liberal rulings.""   So even after Warren retired and the court reverted to its typical right-wing lean, liberals had to keep up the pretense.    They basically gaslighted their own voters into thinking all the right-wing rulings since were impartial,  when any truly objective observer could see that they were plainly not."
