Eldgrim,Nikita is Jaeger irl.
sleepy_the_fish,"That's honestly what I've been bummed out about the most.  I don't mind the ammo overhaul that much,  but the only reason I'm using the Razer Vortex or the Eotech Vudu is because they're really the only scopes that work right.   Removing them from traders wouldn't be a big deal if all the other scopes worked correctly."
aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,"Nikita, one year ago, said-

""guys please relax. we are working on optics/sights overhaul with iterations. Proposed changes are taken in consideration long time ago already. It does not mean that we can't or we dont't want to do it, it means that we need to do it properly with all of the upcoming changes/features etc.""

The biggest change to sights has beeeeeeeeennnnnnn.... Removing scopes?"
Ikuorai,"so many useless sights in this game because they have them broken out of the box.  They continue to just do random stuff that has no positive bearing on the game like removing sights from traders, when they could allow actual choice with all sights being better."
AetherBytes,They should legit just pay that guy like $500 for the rights to those and use them themselves.
SomeFuckingMillenial,"Frankly, it would be cheap AF to just pay the modders of the forbidden mod to implement some of the changes to tarkov. So cheap.  I bet they'd even xfer the work for free if asked kindly enough."
fsPhilipp2499,Adding a zoom changing animation (it's already in the game) would have gone a long way too imho.
CampLite101,"I'll go even further back and ask where the fuck are the inverse kinematics they randomly removed in 2017 and promised would be added back later? Also flashlights are still trash compared to what we had in 2017. 

Post twitch drop players have no clue just how deep in lies this company is."
Wheat9546,"Just BSG Big Brain Balancing, just remove the sights people that 99.9% of the playerbase uses and they'll BE FORCED TO USE THE OTHER SHITTY ONES THAT NO ONE USES   


BRILLIANT"
AquaPSN-XBOX,Remember when they nerfed all of our favorite sights instead of making the crappy ones better? BSG is the only company who actively attempts to make player experience worse for ALL players
Hendeith,"The cycle of BSG:

- rework stuff because what you had was overall meh

- fuck up everything except few guns/scopes/armors

- people are forced to use only few guns/scopes/armors that are not fucked up

- remove them from traders/market/make them LL4 and lock behind quests because Nikita hates that meta exists

Job well done, you just made game shittier (again)"
badluck_bryan77,Easier just to remove stuff that is there instead of doing actual work.
Hane24,"Remember the quest overhaul? Remember the story line and tutorial? Remember the ""best in house anticheat""? Remember the trader overhaul? Remember the group system addition? 

Streets was supposed to come out before reserve/military base as well.

11.7 was only supposed to be a few weeks before .12, spoilers it was 9 months.

BSG has lost their spark, and are just burnt out on this game. They've even said so. One of the main devs even said a year ago that he hadn't even played the game in 2 years. They wanna just rush tarkov to 1.0 and move on. They've literally said as much."
HJALMARI,"Remember when Nikita said in the thread they wanted to do it properly but didn't?

2 years goes fast."
cth777,‚ÄúGuYs PlEaSe ReLaX‚Äù - Nikita on that post
CityOfTheArdvark,"But we got streets. Who cares if you can't run it. Who cares if the game becomes airsoft. Who cares about this game. Shut up and go see lightkeeper.
 Sincerely Nikita
Ps. Next wipe we are putting cooldown timers on pmcs"
Vjekov88,"IMO the scopes need a timed animation when switching magnification, like when switching firing modes."
Thebottlemap,"Out of all takes, this is the correct one. We effectively have a bunch of redundant sights because they aren't implemented correctly"
eodFox,"Its not about that BSG wants to us to use other sights. They want to reduce the trader offering and do it step by step. I predict, that they remove more and more high-tier items from the traders in the future."
VelvetThunder2319,Pepperidge Farm remembers
Txontirea,"The more I learn about the arrogance of this devteam the more funny it all becomes. In a kind of painful way, admittedly."
Mean-Ad-9193,They are the reason people cheat because their changes are always shit
xXNodensXx,"yeah, not a fan of arbitrarily removing the best scopes in the game...  I haven't been playing much since the wipe.  Maybe I'm finally over Tarkov."
RUSKITURBOBLYAT,Nikita will ignore this and then add another obscure russian collimator that will be useless because of the giant housing blocking half of the view
FetusMeatloaf,"Nikita: *makes half the sights unusable*

*Players stop using them*

Nikita: *surprise pikachu face*"
TylerTry1,"All i use is MRS from ll1 skier, so i've never noticed. Maybe im gatekeeping myself?"
boomstik4,"Holy shit that was a year ago, time flies"
svtdrew,I agree with this. Most of the optics have horrendous sway when adsing. Only handful of optics are used for a reason.
Rezhyn,"I think everyone uses those sights because they're incredibly clean and allow you to essentially have a red dot on an automatic gun *and* snipe with it far away. There are plenty of other perfectly usable sights that just aren't as flexible or 'clean'.

I agree eye relief and obvious bugs can ruin some, but others are quite good. Most people just don't like having to actually lock themselves into a scope or a holo (or the combo mount). They are still available on the flea at not even much of a markup."
Xmoneycristo,I would rather the game be optimized or a better cheater system. Top priorities.
ThomzUK,Lost all hope when they made the pk-06 bad. God forbid we have good optics that work in the shooting game. Don't understand why they all can't be usable and we use what we like.
AdhesiveCam,"I just got my first time seeing an AD0 p4 scope. I was stoked, looked great. No scopes unlocked but maybe I can use this one!  Imagine me shegrin that the red dot sensitivity is so low it's unusable. I google it and find out that this has been an issue for 3 years and no end in sight. Bsg pls"
WhyGuy0102,Bsg nerfing the availability of the only viable sights causing people to use ugly ass sights
Nuggetsofsteel,"The obvious and ideal solution is to fix the awful sights as you mention. However, on top of that the LPVOs did need to be made less accessibl, although I think the best way to do that is to increase the price.

BSG has always been obnoxiously afraid to attempt a comprehensive approach to balancing prices at traders. I think it's insane that you can play the game for hours on end, grinding quests and trader rep and for there to be huge gaps in what is available as gear from the traders. As their solution to coveted gear is to remove it from traders, outside of the AS VAL.

What will fix the metagaming is if you moderately balance the value proposition of weapons, ammo, armor, and attachments. BSG has taken a reclining chair approach to that part of the game in my opinion."
theEdward234,"How about that new UI as well? Has been promised 2 years ago, Nikita even had ""a couple"" different UIs ready to implement the just had to pick which one."
theCleversleazoid,"And this is why I play SPT, zero fucks given."
ConradIronmonger,"i don't liek meta reeee, i gonna fight meta rreeeeeeeeee, there is going to be no meta in tarkov reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee (c) Nikita

proceeds to remove everything decent from his game"
ravenousglory,"You still can buy Vudu and Razor, it's not banned from FM it's banned from traders"
MandoBanando,I still play Tarkov but im convinced the devs are a bunch of lazy fucks that don't want to do work
Crimie1337,nah just remove the good ones or make them bad
sanctionTheOrcs,"I understand the sentiment of post, agree. Just wanted to ask wasn't it part of nikitas vision that with each iteration it will be more about what you find than what you buy? I haven't watched BSG streams more than year, have no clue."
Vastroy,"Every gaming subreddit has been complaining lately, that or I just never noticed. Not sayings it‚Äôs undeserving but eh"
AKoper8tor,XDDDDDDDDD
