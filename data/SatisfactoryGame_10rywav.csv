redditbing,"FYI: On a live stream a few years back, Snutt was talking about how a developer is afraid of spiders and insisted on adding the arachnophobia mode so they could play test.

They came up with the lore that the helmet‚Äôs AR is ‚Äúcensoring‚Äù the spiders by overlaying the cat images on the inside of your visor. The visor tech that Ficsit added was a rush job which is why the images are static, low quality, and flicker"
AC_Bradley,I want an arachnophilia mode that turns more things into spiders.
Shadowbound199,That would be u/JaceAtCoffeeStain I believe.
emorisch,Just wait till you see what it does. You might change your mind.
Tryant666,I read this option as turning this mode on will give you arachnophobia!
Temporal_Illusion,"**Agreed For Those Whom Need It.**

1. Additionally, added in [Update 7](https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_0.7.0.0#Creatures), the use of the [Creature Hostility Setting](https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Settings#Creatures) of **Passive** makes exploration easier.
2. Combined with [Arachnophobia Mode](https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Settings#Gameplay), you can now beat up on ""kittens"" to your heart content.

TheMahoganyTree8,"I use it even though I love spiders, it makes them bigger and easier to hear, I love it."
zseliakiraly,"When first started to play I went through the options first and turned it on. Nevers saw any spiders, yay

Then encountered the cats and thought: ""well it's early access, maybe they are placehoders for creatures added later"" 

And year later realised that the cats are actually masking the spiders."
KingcoleIIV,"As a non-arachnophobe, the cats are so much creepier to me lol"
Less-Confection-3434,"Thanks Jace, helps alot"
GoodoDarco,"Yeah my girlfriend saw it in the settings, and said ""oh what's this?"" then found the spider cave, and immediately turned it on"
Storm_runner426,It makes fighting in dark caves so much easier
20EMANON02,tbh i am more scared of there cats than the actual spiders
0190038r34,Now you can have catphobia
IAmNotJasonTrustMe,"Im not even really arachnophobic, i just like the cat pngs"
KajMak64Bit,"Suuuure bro...

*shame it makes things more scary then actual spiders*"
AntonyPNT,Wait? They added spiders to the game?
Sc0lapasta,"context:  
i was chilling in the game when a GIANT spider randomly jumped in front of me, that was TERRIFYING (i'm highly arachnophobic, because of little traumas involving spiders that appened when i was little).  
finally i can access caves without the fear of having little/big spiders jumpscaring me, wich is very very good for me.  
however, i think it need a little ''rework'' because sometimes i can see very little parts of the spiders texture, wich still makes me scare my soul.  
another little problem is that, when i kill a spider and take his loot, you can still look at its white outlines, and yes, it scares me.  
i am probably being very critic talking about this filter, but dont understand me wrong, i still LOVE the arachophobia mode because i can play the game without so much fear of random spiders coming, it just need some reworks for people who are very very very scared of spiders, like me and other people.

thanks everyone for the 600 upvotes!, sorry for my non fluent english writing, i'm still working on it."
MoonBoots4600,Thank you for alerting me to the existence of this so I can turn it on. I've just been avoiding those areas all this time
KYO297,They made spiders that are scary to normal people. But they're too scary for arachnophobia people. So I'd say it makes sense they'd make something equally scary but also something that isn't spiders
SaltyGeymer2001,I just realized that this is literally pussy mode XD
BantramFidian,I cannot be the only one that is far more scared by the the kitties than the stingers themselves
DoobiousMaximus420,This is bloody un-Australian
SargeanTravis,Now OP will hate cats too!
toothpaste-girl,they also have misophonia mode which is super sweet and thoughtful
Slntkilr25,The misophonia mode is a god send too.
EetTheMeak,Nope. It's worse.
Lemme_eat_your_pvssy,"I dunno why they did. Fighting shit is supposed to be scary. I really wish there was tech to scan the mind of the player, find what their worst fear is, and then turn their opponents into that (turn everyihing into clowns with horns in their noses, so honks instead of meows = lol)."
Pit_Full_of_Bananas,The cats are just as scary.
Ambitious-Parking-28,"I've always held the unpopular opinion that the damn spiders are awful and should be replaced with cave trolls. Build an entire storyline about how they're the indigenous people to the planet and then late game you can ally with them by sending them resources, eventually becoming friendly with them and unlocking access to a secondary map that is completely underground. Maybe make it into an expansion pack...but like I said, I know I'm on the unpopular side because the last time I mentioned this, the downvote army invaded."
ucrbuffalo,I think it‚Äôs worse
No-Obligation7435,That's cats are definitely just as scary üòÇ
SeaworthinessInner94,I quite like spiders in real life but I find stingers really disturbing. I think it's the footsteps and their general speed. Horrible.
Sc0lapasta,me now: lol a cute spider
