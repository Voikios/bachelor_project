{"Title": "UNBANNED! - Don't kill streamers if you want to keep your account", "Post Text": "Hey everyone, just letting you know **I've been unbanned!** I'm not sure what the best way to prove this is so I'll just attach a couple different screenshots.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Bro9EOa](https://imgur.com/a/Bro9EOa)\n\n(Just so you know, that KD includes scavs. I've only killed 39 PMC's in 67 raids-oof)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/8eO0zns](https://imgur.com/a/8eO0zns)\n\n(I wasn't even able to sign into the launcher before)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/iqY8xR5](https://imgur.com/a/iqY8xR5)\n\n(it used to say BANNED in big red letters next to my name)\n\nI was absolutely blown away by all the support I received through this. Thank you all so much for sticking with me. Say what you will about this game, but the community stands together. I seriously had 5+ people offer to buy me a new game.\n\nSpecial thanks to /u/trentbraidner for reaching out to BSG and keeping me updated, /u/OnepegMG for spreading the word/straight up buying me a new game, and /u/Jinx0028 who bought me a new game too. I did not ask them to haha, but I think it's awesome they were so willing nonetheless. The amount of supportive DM's I've received has been awesome as well.\n\nI received quite a few DM's from people who have also been falsely banned. It's clear to me that this is a far more common issue than it seems and hopefully changes can be made at BSG to counteract this. The truth is, **had my post not blown up, I would most likely still be banned for months to come.**\n\nShoot me a friend request if you ever need someone to raid with, thanks again everyone.\n\n[**Original Post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10b70ec/dont_kill_streamers_if_you_want_to_keep_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "ID": "10dpz45", "Score": 6942, "Total Comments": 893, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10dpz45/unbanned_dont_kill_streamers_if_you_want_to_keep/"}
