{"Title": "Given the latest reality of bans, are our accounts safe?", "Post Text": "During some of discussions, it was brought up and agreed upon that since streamers and sherpas have pretty much the power to ask BSG to ban \"sus\" users, how do we know our accounts are safe?\n\nAs I have mentioned here ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10bgtn8/comment/j4f7kza/?context=3)),  **I feel quite stressed that there is a chance I can lose my account because I kill wrong person in a video game**. I have EoD and just imagining I can step on wrong toe and lose it is pretty off-putting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKudo's to  [**thebatfink**](https://www.reddit.com/user/thebatfink/) on this one!\n\n*Many people are targeting their distaste at just Rengawr. ... But the real issue is, that could be you, me or anyone else having their very expensive game stolen from them.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso [**keyringer**](https://www.reddit.com/user/keyringer/) much appreciated their take on issue ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10bxszy/comment/j4f79m0/?context=3))\n\n*Something that just came to mind is that* ***we are only hearing about this because the player was able to actually loot the dogtag and make the connection****. How many people get similar kills, but don't manage to loot the dogtag, then wake up the next morning, and their account is banned?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some key notes to close this and let's face the reality:**\n\nBSG team gets killed by someone during raid? Ban arrives within minutes.\n\nStreamer gets killed by \"sus\" player as we all do? Ban arrives within minutes.\n\nStreamer gets banned for whatever reason, looses gear, etc.? Solved within minutes to hours.\n\nNormal player gets banned? Enjoy ban for life.\n\nNormal player encounters problem like bug with karma, loot lost due to error, etc.? Don't expect BSG to address it, only streamers have that power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBSG really needs to start communicating with their player base or this will go downhill pretty fast as with other games that abandoned their players and kept them in the dark.", "ID": "10cidfn", "Score": 2022, "Total Comments": 581, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10cidfn/given_the_latest_reality_of_bans_are_our_accounts/"}
