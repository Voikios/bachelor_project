grandchester,"During the 300 speaker votes every single republican who nominated McCarthy talked about crime, boarder security, fentanyl, etc. with such urgency and passion. What is the first thing they do out of the gate?  Protect their wealthy donors of course!!!"
PhyterNL,"And just like that all pretense of budget concern is gone from so-called ""conservative"" House leadership. Didn't even last one Mouche."
kiltedturtle,">	Progressive U.S. lawmakers on Monday took House Republicans to task after the Congressional Budget Office said the erstwhile deficit hawks' first bill before the 118th Congress—a measure critics say is meant to ""protect wealthy and corporate tax cheats""—will swell the federal deficit by more than $100 billion.

>""They all run on reducing the deficit and now the House GOP's first... bill will increase the deficit by $114 billion,"" tweeted Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). ""Make it make sense.""

>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the euphemistically named Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act—which faces a vote as soon as Monday evening—would ""decrease outlays by $71 billion and decrease receipts by $186 billion over the 2023-2032 period.""

Ok, so this is the first law that will die in the Senate.  Whats next on the list?  The more time they spend on bills that will never get signed is fine.  They can pass crap like this all day.  And for what its worth, Biden has said he will veto it.   Not likely that the GQP will ever get to a veto-override on any of their bills in the next two terms."

slickprime,Now if only I made enough money to be able to cheat on my taxes....
DriftlessDairy,"The Republicans continue to defund the white-colar police.  
Specifically, they have pushed to defund:  
• The US Chemical Safety Board, which polices major industrial accidents.  
• The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which polices corporations’ compliance with civil rights laws.  
• The Consumer Products Safety Commission, which polices industries to make sure their products don’t harm or kill people. The agency now acknowledges that its “funding level has been insufficient to keep pace with the evolving consumer product marketplace.”  
• The Internal Revenue Service, which polices the tax system and which is responsible for making sure the wealthy and large corporations pay the taxes they owe. Thanks to this successful effort to defund the police, the agency “conducted 675,000 fewer audits in 2017 than it did in 2010, a drop in the audit rate of 42 percent,” according to ProPublica. With 30,000 fewer tax cops on the beat, a recent Treasury Department report found that 800,000 high-income households have not paid more than $45 billion in owed taxes.  
• The Department of Labor, which polices employers and makes sure they aren’t stealing wages, breaking workplace safety rules, ignoring overtime laws, and/or violating workers’ union rights. Amid this particular Republican effort to defund the police, there are now fewer cops scrutinizing employers than ever before and workplace inspections have plummeted – as workplace injuries, deaths and disasters have increased.  
• The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which polices the accounting industry.  
• The Securities and Exchange Commission’s reserve fund, which was established after the financial crisis to bolster the agency’s work policing Wall Street. The agency reports that the number of law enforcement staff “supporting our investigation and litigation efforts remained almost 9 percent lower” today than it was at the start of Trump’s term – and now white collar prosecutions have hit a historic low.  
• The law enforcement agencies that police corporate mergers. This effort to defund the antitrust police has come as mergers have accelerated (and there has been some recent effort to reverse the defunding).  
• The independent law enforcement agency that policed agribusiness monopolies.  
• The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which polices the financial industry and works to protect consumers from fraud.  
• The law enforcement offices that police federal agencies and root out waste, fraud and abuse.  
• The federal program that polices local law enforcement agencies.  
• The Environmental Protection Agency, which is responsible for policing polluters. Trump’s first budget proposed to reduce EPA “spending on civil and criminal enforcement by almost 60 percent,” and laying off 200 environmental cops, according to the New York Times. By the middle of Trump’s first year in office, the EPA had “fewer than half of the criminal special agents on the job” during the George W. Bush administration, according to one environmental advocacy group. Bloomberg News noted that Trump’s most recent budget cuts “could hamper the EPA’s efforts to link contamination at hazardous waste sites to companies and others that may be responsible for the pollution.” The result: environmental prosecutions have now hit a historic low.

esotericenema,"There is no reason left to vote Republican.  No reason at all.  Even for formally one-issue voters.  And I'll admit I used to be a pretty much one issue voter.  But there is no reason, anymore, no matter what your one issue was.  Unless you happen to be an insanely rich and evil person.  That's really the only demographic left for the GOP, and that should be terrifying.  Because even though that's a tiny minority, that's a tiny minority with A LOT OF POWER, and the malicious will to use it."

Can any Republican explain to me why this is what you keep desperately clamoring for? 

They. Don’t. Give. A. Fuck. About. You. 

They literally prove time and again that they’re not “fiscal conservatives” in any way. They trigger you to vote for them by screeching about illegals and all sorts of other dumb, non-existent shit just to get your vote and then do *literally nothing* to quell the fears they’ve stoked in you.

MindSteve,"What is this, GTA? How do I enable tax cheats?"
Marnever,"Why does this headline (like so many others) focus on the apparent response from the other side as opposed to the actual story? A far more succinct and useful headline would just be “House GOP Introduces Bill Adding $114 Billion to Deficit By Enabling Tax Cheats”. I don’t understand how we got to the point that the “clap back” or the “blast” or the “slam” is the relevant part of any given story. Like yeah sure it’s good to note that democrats are criticizing this dumpster fire of a move, but that’s not the real meat and potatoes is it? The actual story that should be the focal point is that the republicans (who campaign endlessly on reducing the deficit) are doing the exact opposite of their promises just like anyone with a brain would expect. It’s just bizarre to me how so much of our discourse skirts around the bits that matter in order to pump up the fanfare and theatrics."

SporkOfThor,"All budget and deficit concerns are now gone in the House with a Republican majority.  Why?

Republican ""Starve The Beast"" philosophy says debt doesn't matter if it's caused by more big tax breaks and subsidies for their crony billionaire campaign contributors.  

Democrats' attempts to balance the budget will be criticized by Republicans as a giveaway to the undeserving poor (black people) and a treasonous existential emergency for our economy."
RilohKeen,"The Republican Party is the “give more money to rich people and fuck everyone else” party. That is their one and only goal or concern. All the rest, the hate, the racism, the guns, the religion, all of that is bait, just smoke and mirrors that they use to get impoverished rubes to vote for giving their taxes to rich people. The really sad part is that it works every single time, all so ignorant assholes across the country can say, “at least I’m not some *liberal* who wants their tax dollars to *help people* and make life better for average Americans!”"

Dude... I fucking hate this, I'm so sick of it. Like, is this ever going to end? Congress is where our democracy goes to die, also why aren't the people involved in the vote to appoint people to committees and shit? It's all these assholes just doing reach arounds and appointing themselves, like we have an election denier on the homeland security committee... You think sane people wanted him there? Fuck no."

Twigling,"It wont get past the Senate but it's still well worth the Dems highlighting what the Republicans are trying to do and hence what they stand for. 

The next two years will be spent by House Republicans trying to pass their bills that, if passed by the House, never get through the Senate (oh yeah, and trying to impeach Biden for whatever the hell they feel like). It'll be a complete waste of time (which is of course the idea) and definitely not in the best interests of the country. It will though allow the Republicans to point their fingers at the Democrats and say ""look, they've done nothing!"" because their extremely gullible voters will just lap it up (with the help of lying media organisations like Fox 'News').

Hopefully 2024 will see the Republicans reduced to irrelevancy."
FlyingRhenquest,"Yeah, it's pretty clear Republicans are all about cheating on their taxes and not paying their debts. That seems like the opposite of fiscal responsibility to me. Or maybe I'm just a chump for believing that you should pay your debts, because if everyone did what they did the economy would collapse. Our roads and bridges would also be (Well... also *are*) collapsing as well. Because unlike some fantasy book they might spank it to as teenagers, people will not come together and do that shit for free."

Modsda3,"Why is this always their first go to, and why is no one paying attention?!"
GuitarGeezer,"     A fair critique of the Republicans as they are clearly on the side of tax cheats here and are aggressively dishonest about tax reform. That being said, voters of both parties who have a problem with any of this need to seriously consider doing something more than nothing about campaign finance reform which may require a constitutional amendment-I am a federal practice attorney and know what I am talking about. 

     Tax policy and legislation in general is seldom done with a rational basis. Rather, those who finance the campaigns directly and through shadow spending using ‘charitables’ are purchasing the right to directly draft federal laws in-house at their lobbies. Even bipartisan legislation (the bankruptcy heist of 2005 and the fixing of student loan laws and literally thousands of other laws) is usually just proof that both sides were purchased in a way that wasn’t anywhere near this bad prior to the 1980s until you go wayyy back. Congress staffs tell me when I lobby and complain that almost no voter has ever so much as complained to them in any way about our system of legalized bribery and coercion. Sometimes prior to 2010 I was the only person in my entire state bugging them about it. Sickening suicidal negligence by voters."

The key issue is it shifts tax burden disproportionately onto lower and middle class Americans, completely bypasses businesses entirely, and is a proportionately lean burden on the wealthy.  Every tax payer has paid hundreds of dollars more a year, every year for more than half a decade because of it."
Fernway67,Worthless republicans

SpockShotFirst,"They understand the concept of ""Defund the police"" just not the purpose."
Bubblejuiceman,"""Blast"" ""Slam"" ""Destroy"". 

The fuck are we taking about, Pokemon?"
Kyonikos,"The flip side of gutting the IRS so they can't do their jobs in auditing the rich is how they have dropped the threshold for scrutinizing activity on sites like eBay and Poshmark down to $600 so they can automatically shake down the non-rich. Millions of us who have been selling our used items and clothes on sites like these can now expect to be getting CP2000 notices ""suggesting"" that we owe back taxes and penalties and there will be nobody at the IRS to talk to in order to clear this sort of thing."
Kyral210,"Ah yes, freedom! The party of Trump is ironically the party of tax fraud… who would have thought it?"
Cryophilous,"Don't worry It'll ""trickle down"" and whatnot. This is better for the working class I promise. I'm sure all those billionaires evading taxes will use the money saved to take better care of their employees and most definitely not on their 7th luxury yacht."
tunamelts2,"I don’t understand what these hard right lunatics have against the IRS collecting what is owed to the American people. If you’re trying to cheat your way out of paying your fair share through tax fraud, your ass deserves to be in prison."
analog_approach,"Titles that include a reaction to something done by someone else are a sure sign of clickbait garbage. 

This is a good example"
cogitoergopwn,"I'm checking out of politics w/ these idiots in power and a compromised DOJ. I think Merrick Garland spits in the face of democracy for his indefensible lack of urgency, politicization, and spinelessness to protect us from foreign/dark money-funded traitors."
Actual__Wizard,Doesn't paying your taxes help limit inflation?
MommasDisapointment,The crooks run the country what’s the point in trying?

Faustt_Thee_Artist,It’s why they were elected. Of course they cut IRS staff
dzastrus,"Wait, don’t Democrats get to filibuster every bill by submitting an official email, too?"
