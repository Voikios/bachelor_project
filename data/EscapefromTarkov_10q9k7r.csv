Savagenius,The more I find out about the Lightkeeper the less interested I am. None of the quests seem fun or worthwhile.
TheRealSlobberknob,"Jokes on them. I was never going to get that far anyways, at least not on a 6ish month wipe schedule."
TheFlabbs,You have just sent the cavalry to that island in making this post. People are going to abuse the fuck out of that lmao
THROBBINW00D,I already have a full time job I don't need another one.
vaapr,It almost seems as if they wanted to make the quest line impossible and then tweak it next wipe or something. Iâ€™m new to this game but holy shit as a level 17 I donâ€™t ever see myself getting to level 40-50.
i4play,"Absolute trash mechanic. Everyone and their granny can go there and bait players who have unlocked those LK quests and they pretty much have to take the L unless they want to get on those tedious tasks. I am indifferent because I know I will not ever get far enought to unlock LK, but this is just stupid gamedesign 101"
attomsk,This might be some of the worst content ever added hahaha
Trygvelurius,"Sniping from the lighthouse into the mainland seems incredibly abuseable then, if you've met Lighkeeper you can't return fire. 

Does it work both ways then, if someone on the Lighthouse kills someone on the mainland do they get punished the same way?"
pistonslapper,The worst part of lightkeeper quests is having to play lighthouse...
BaderBlade,"So, if I'm camping the bridge and a full Chad shows up, he can't kill me and i can kill him, ransack him and leave for free meta kits? And if he kills me he fucked up, wow i will definitely do that"
PukkaMeal,"why even release lightkeeper, what a joke he is"
IMIv2,"I'm confused now, dont you NEED to kill 20 pmcs on the bridge for his quest?"
Ru8ey,Braindead devs
Niitroglycerine,"Honestly light keeper is the most disappointing piece of content they have ever added and I genuinely wish they just saved it for 1.0 and never spoke his name

All that hype for this shit"
Txontirea,This seems like genuine cock and ball torture. Fuck everything about this stupid NPC haha
joe102938,"Yo fuck every word of this post. 

This game is way to grindy to still be fun."
BoogMan1980,"They might as well have light keepers dead fuckin corpse when you FINALLY get to him, just as a final kick in the dick. 

His quest line is absolutely asinine right now, theyâ€™re for sure gonna have to redo all of that shit"
Enthused_Llama,"I'm not sure BSG understands how 'emergent gameplay' works.

In a game with zero punishment (and in fact, massive encouragement) for KoS behavior, you can't suddenly introduce a no KoS mechanic with no warning."
Radioactiveglowup,"Man, this game is utter shit with quest design.

What the hell is this? ""Play the game, then get slapped with an insane grind task to get back to where you were as punishment for playing the game?"""
Trust-Grouchy,Nah just kill them. They will do it to you later in wipe
Scarity,"I dont get it, isn't there a quest to kill pmcs on that bridge aswell?"
GarryGirth,im level 38 and once I get level 42 im done with questing. Idk how you people do those annoying ass quest.
SourceNo2702,"Wait

Killing the cultist boss has zero repercussions if you havenâ€™t done the quest line then?

Holy shit dude, you get a ton of EXP for killing him. This may be the most optimal farming method"
BurningHotels,"These quests just ruin the experience for me. I think I'm done with tarkov late game. The feeling of progression is what keeps me in a game. When the quests or requirements are stupidly complicated, difficult or just hyper time consuming, it just ruins the whole mood.

I got to Kappa the wipe before last and was gated by the fucking level cap. I simply did not have the raw time to grind those levels before wipe. I find ""The Guide"" the most unfun bs quest in Tarkov. It just feels exhausting and anxiety inducing. Atleast Quests like shooter born and tarkov shooter 8 provide challenge thats clearly doable."
LYCAN_247_ZA,Missions are becoming so stupid in Tarkov . Sit in a bush for 40min and throw all your gear away and extract with nothing 3ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Maleficent_Hat4905,honestly the quest themselves is what ruins this game.
jeff5551,Crazy how lightkeeper came 2 wipes late and still released in a horrible state
overwatchlap,"So many people here are unreasonably upset. Yeah, it's hard, but I am confident that 95% of those complaining will not even come near this quest chain at the first place."
grimshogun,They time gated all this shit cause they knew the community would hate it. They should have just left lightkeeper and all the quests out IMO.
AbsentOfReason,What a boring terrible idea from BSG. Lightkeeper is nothing more than achievement.
CarheartTheMan,Honestly I donâ€™t want lightkeeper anymore just seems like dogshit the only thing Iâ€™d do if for is Intel 3 and thatâ€™s stupid because we had Intel 3 before he was a thing so dumb
ego_less,wth are the devs smoking
ConstantCarnage,This game is so trash lmao
dumnem,"Lol that's fucking tarkov for you

Absolutely 0 warning and it MASSIVELY punishes you, to the extent that it will take hours and hours to fix.

Dude I wonder how good the crack is that bsg is smoking"
P0werEdge,"I had that quest line myself it went from the quest that i had to deliver 4 SVDS which are not RARE on woods Sniper took me about 15 raids to get out with 4 SVDS's to the last quest on that line where i had to find again the V3 flash, for some reason it skipped all other quests in between."
ArcticHuskyyy,Itâ€™s quest line is sooo hard because Lightkeepers reward/trading/whatever they want to have when the quest line is done is not ready yet.
Snarker,It does say on the wiki to not kill any pmcs in the area.
dimsumdonair2,"The whole point of that quest is to refrain you from doing it again 

It makes sense for it to be hard 

It's still obtainable but if you are going around doing that 

Ya full well deserve the time consuming punishment"
F_Dingo,I'm not going to do stupid Lighthouse Keeper quests. Rival PMCs will be SHOT ON SIGHT regardless of where they are.
DucksMatter,Would this happen again if you finished all the make amends quests?
Haksupaksu,Never going to get to him so wont matter
CreatedReality,"This seems like a bug. I could totally see a punishment questline for trying to farm the boss, but the pmc thing makes no sense."
RoboticControl187,If he killed you would he get punished? If not having the transmitter and being on the lighthouse is the best sniper position in the game right now. You even get boss support
paulfunyan,"Wait, can't you only have like 225k roubles on you at a time? Or is that hand in not in-raid?"
Borschik,How does one even figure out that you cant shoot PMCs on the bridge? Is it even stated somewhere?
GoTTi4200,I remember when everyone was stoked about light keeper..... Now...not so much hahahaha and it all makes sense
llB1ackoutll,Whatâ€™s really shitty to me is how ridiculously out of reach he is for 90% of the player base
YungR29,The dialogue and animation was the hefty load this wipe ðŸ˜­ other than that absolutely nothing
Dominik_17,I wonder what the exact rules to this are. What happens if you dont have the dspt with you? Does it only apply to the island and bridge or where is the border? And does it mean you're not allowed to shoot from bridge and island yourself and not someone who is there?
Dyils,"I am completely ignoring him. Once again, like every previous wipe, I stop questing at around 40-42 level and just enjoy myself. Going to look for PvP, having fun, that's all. 

I previously ignored Kappa, now I will ignore Lightkeeper. Equally not worth it imo."
ShoodaW,"Wait  


People want real prizes for real effort in tarkov?  


Bruh"
Dido_Dtv,"Today I was on the island, about to turn in a LK quest, and suddenly I CANT ENTER, I hear loud bangs and shit, people were trying to come to the Island. I go and see Zyrachi is dead, then I remember this post and was super scared to shoot at the people. so I just shoot at their legs... so they can't come.  They waited till 2 minutes left on the raid timer and ran for the exit.. I stayed and shot at them trying to kill them while they were running...  I DIED MIA on rocks! I WAS THE NEW ZYRACHI! I AM HAPPY.

Anyway if somebody have killed Zyrachi, should I be able to kill them? I didn't try cus I really don't want to go on that side quests bullshit. Does anybody know?"
PleaseRecharge,"I'm glad they did this. It is a clear sign of ""If you kill people doing these quests, you're a dick and deserve to be punished."
Sargash,1mil is nothing for someone at that point in the game lmao
LocksmithCharming790,4 svd should be no problem. Just run woods and kill sthurman and his guards 2-3 times. Shouldnâ€™t take longer than 3-4 hours if you reset instantly if he is not there.
korewarp,Lmao just don't shoot people at the lighthouse. You dingus. Not everyone you see needs to get shot. This is not a deathmatch game.
DrXyron,"25 raiders on reserve is easy though. SVDs are harder but with pscav often spawning with one, it isnâ€™t the end of the worldâ€¦ 

But yes, not delaying progression is much better."
itsbrave,BATTLESTATE GAMES LIMITED
acaerus,It\`s almost like they making game design decisions based on data gathered only from streamers gameplay :D I mean this will explain A LOT...
BulkyNet7937,games ez quest no cry and youll get him :D
wilck44,"I saw lightkeeper as stupidly grindy but now, wow.

it is even worth the effort for anyone?"
ActionBlyat,"if im on assessment pt1 and see you running there, im 100% shooting (:"
Daniluk41,Fair
BulkyNet7937,"Hey im level 55 and just killed my 1st pmc at the lighthouse died to the guards right after

It then made me start the Make Amends - Buyout quest ( find 4 SVDS fir )

I decided to recode my DSPT takes 12 hours and  retry a lighthouse run, i can confirm you are NOT banned from here after recoding so all hope is not lost!!!! You CAN go to the lightkeeper again  once you recode!!!!!

hope this gives you motivation again for anyone stuck on this bullshit quest"
RedYoshikira,"BSG giveth
BSG taketh
screw the quests
kill those raiders anyway and incentivize using their gear to become stronger.

New reason to not play lighthouse"
vectorseven,Thatâ€™s heartwarming. Iâ€™ve rage quit Tarkov a couple times already. This is my first wipe. I paid attention and used the 556A1 or whatever the better ammo is. Night and day. I hate this game.
