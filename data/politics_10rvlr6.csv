newfrontier58,">House Republicans had set their sights on removing Omar after she had made what Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) recently described as “repeated antisemitic and anti-American remarks” throughout her time as a member of the House. The resolution, once adopted, would explicitly condemn Omar for using an antisemitic trope to suggest Israel’s allies in U.S. politics were motivated by money rather than principle when she in 2019 tweeted, “It’s all about the Benjamins baby.”  


Just to point out, Trump has repeatedly stated that any Jewish person who doesn't support Israel or him is ""disloyal"" and George Santos raised money on kickstaretr using a Jewish-sounding alias because ""the Jews will give more if you’re a Jew.""

I know that there's no shame there anymore sos hypocrisy won't affect the GOP, but I still felt then need to write it."
washingtonpost,"**From reporter Marianna Sotomayor:**

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) was kicked off the House Foreign Affairs Committee in a party-line vote that followed a contentious debate on the House floor Thursday morning that included yelling and Omar defending herself on the verge tears.

House Republicans had set their sights on removing Omar after she had made what Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) recently described as “repeated antisemitic and anti-American remarks” throughout her time as a member of the House. The resolution, once adopted, would explicitly condemn Omar for using an antisemitic trope to suggest Israel’s allies in U.S. politics were motivated by money rather than principle when she in 2019 tweeted, “It’s all about the Benjamins baby.”

The resolution also disapproves of Omar’s critiques of Israel and her comparison of actions by the United States to those of terrorist groups. She later clarified those comments, saying, “I was in no way equating terrorist organizations with democratic countries with well-established judicial systems.”

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), while noting that Omar has made mistakes, forcefully defended her in a Thursday morning news conference, saying: “What’s going to take place on the floor today is not a public policy debate. It’s not about accountability. It’s about political revenge.”

Omar, a refugee from Somalia, is one of the first Muslim women to serve in the House of Representatives and often faces death threats and other threats of violence. Her office told The Post that violent threats had increased considerably since she has been in the news again. On Wednesday, Omar tweeted an expletive-laden voice mail she received this week in which a man said, “I’ll put a bullet in your f------ head and get the f--- out of my country.”

“These threats increase whenever Republicans put a target on my back,” she wrote. “They can continue to target me, but they will never stop me from fighting for a more just world.”

Icommandyou,Rep. Ilhan Omar's ouster from the committee isn't surprising but a good indication that the current GOP majority has started its revenge tour. Next up is worthless impeachments and subpoenas. None of these will help American people. The very next vote after Ilhan Omar's ousting was denouncing socialism like wtf. There is not one single policy resolution passed by the GOP house and there is no indication they will do so in future. Of course we elected jokers and now we are seeing the circus.

iceflame1211,"Great example of false equivalencies. If we're going off what Republicans have previously said, Marjorie Taylor Greene had calls for the House speaker to be killed. She \~literally\~ told her constituents that Pelosi was guilty of treason, and treason is a crime punishable by death. She denied doing so under oath, but when caught with proof of her lie she changed her answer to say she did not recall.  
  
Further, MTG said if she led the January 6th riots that her people would've been armed and they would've won. I am not sure if that means they would've killed Mike Pence, Pelosi, or that Trump would still be president, or perhaps some combination of these things.  
  
So yes, while Representative Omar made some blatantly wrong and awful comments about Israel- she took them back and apologized for them.  
  
Republicans on the other hand are repeatedly and unapologetically threatening to kill Americans they disagree with. Some of their constituents are actually taking their advice (see: Pelosi's husband, New Mexico, Michigan, etc).

danranja,very predictable comment thread
ruthrachel18reddit,"""New McCarthyism"".

One may not always agree with Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who has made some troubling statements in the past, in my humble opinion, but she does have 1) the right to free speech, and 2) the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.

To call decisions, policies, and/or practices of the State of Israel into question is not *de facto* anti-semitism, in my humble opinion.  There is no state in the world that is above being called to account, whether by its own citizens or the citizens of another country.  Anti-semitism moves beyond mere questioning and calling to account, and is motivated by baseless hatred.

Even if one agrees that certain statements made by Ilhan Omar about the State of Israel are of legitimate concern, her removal from the Foreign Affairs Committee smacks of racism and partisan ""witch-hunt"" tactics, being fueled by a male Speaker against a fellow member of the House who is a woman belonging to both an ethnic and religious minority in our country.

Ilhan Omar has been forcibly removed from the Foreign Affairs Committee for statements which she has made about the State of Israel, while Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) believes in ""Jewish Space Laser"" conspiracies, yet continues to sit on the Oversight and Homeland Security Committees...

...and even more egregious, George Santos (R-NY) continues to occupy a seat in the House of Representatives which was fraudulently won...

This is my opinion as a Jewish woman of color who loves the State of Israel, who is working for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and who is an Independent voter and concerned citizen born in the United States of America."

Willowbaby67,"Absolute bullshit, GOP is rotten to its core!"
Crumblymumblybumbly,"She'll be back on committee in 2024 when Democrats retake the House. It's whatever. 

Republicans have accomplished nothing"
Stormclamp,"While I disagree with republican motives regarding her removal I do have my own problems with how she's acted as a representative and committee member. 

For starters she voted ""present"" on a bill back in 2019 that would have acknowledged and condemned Turkey for the Armenian genocide, along with sanctions against Turkey for supporting militia groups in Syria that were targeting Kurds. While her statement regarding her decision wasn't completely without merit. She should have still voted yes if she truly believed in her commitment to human rights abuses, that's not to say she couldn't have complained about why the bill was introduced, but to vote present merely out of a concern for politics seems quite underwhelming for someone who claims to be concerned with human rights abuses. 

My next concern is one of the organizations she said should investigate and charge US personnel with war crimes instead of American Courts. Now I don't have a problem with this idea on the surface, especially with laws like the ""The Hague Invasion Act,"" and I don't have a problem with her pointing out that there are and have been war crimes committed by US troops. My concern is more with the organization she said that should charge these accused war criminals with. The International Criminal Court shouldn't be the overseer of such cases when they refuse to [even investigate a genocide going on in China.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/world/asia/icc-china-uighur-muslim.html) If this organization is going to play geopolitics in favor of some nations but not others than they have no right to investigate human rights violations when they're playing favoritism. 

I don't know if these concerns should be enough for her dismissal as a committee member, however, I do think she should be called out on biases and geopolitical favoritism, especially if it doesn't reflect on what congress believes regarding its own foreign policy considering she is/was a committee member but that's just me."

Eric_in_America,"So much for freedom of speech and a fervent stance against censorship, suppression and cancel culture. 

Remember that Republicans are more than willing to abandon their so called ""values"" if it's in the name of spite or preserving their culture war. If it's for the sake of thwarting the radical left's depraved and subversive agenda, they'll find any justification for it. In fact, Republicans spend a considerable amount of their time and energy doing just that, finding ways to justify their inherently discriminatory or suppresive measures. 

They'll disguise it as some noble achievement or some counterrevolutionary effort, thus indulging their voter's sense of ""patriotism"", but a vast majority of the time it's either a double standard, or it's part of some ""stick it to the libs"" vindictive crusade, both steeped in a deep-rooted sense of entitlement and a growing right-wing chauvinism. 

This is all while they have the audacity to feign the victim, to claim how they're one of the most persecuted groups in this country. I don't think they'll be happy until they're made a protected class. To them, a demand for accountability or a call for justice is persecution, to them, equality is discrimination, their world is turned upside down by these challenges that ask for a more equitable society. 

When they see someone like Ilhan Omar, in her position,  expressing views that are radically opposed to the party line stance their obligated to take, it threatens the whole paradigm, and their fragile egos of course."

Ilhan was removed because she is an intelligent powerful women that isn't afraid to speak truth to power.  She is seen as an incredible adversary that must be removed at all cost.  She turns Iran Contra trash into frothing imbeciles with barely a sentence uttered."
slinkymello,And the Dems will still be hapless and unable to use this to their advantage
jigglyjaunt,Some people did some things
Leather-Bug3087,"AOC and Ilhan Omar gave very powerful speeches.. calling out the hypocrisy of republicans, the racism and the anti Muslim rhetoric that they continue to push. AOC even called out old marges “Jewish space lasers”. I love seeing dems fight back against the fascists!"
Altruistic-Rope1994,She can go hang out with Kanye now!
Mephisto1822,It’s all about the Benjamin’s.
melikecheese333,"Oh because they didn’t like a few of her tweets????  Have the GOP ever read their own tweets???  The reasoning is laughable for anyone paying just a little bit of attention to anything beyond the Fox News. 

Clowns. People voting for these people are nuts."
Winnimae,Can’t they just go back to being unable to elect a speaker bc the entire party is just a competition over who can be the most insane and the winners didn’t think McCarthy could hang?
One-Presence8015,"It's all well and good to be upset about this. Just remember that there is only one thing you can take action on today.

Plan to vote. Look up local, state, federal elections and vote these scumbags out and replace them with better options.

Vote every time. Make it a priority. It sucks but take a day off work to do it if you have to. 

I make it a personal holiday. Vote in the AM then go do something fun. 

Vote."
ADDeviant-again,"Of course she was.

What a pile of small, smelly dicks ."
obsertaries,Is this unexpected? A hard right GOP has taken power in congress and I assume they’d kick everyone like her out of every committee.
Old_Fart_1948,She made a comment the republicans couldn't respond to. So the republicans want to get rid of her.
sameol_sameol,Wish I could say I’m surprised but…
No-Consideration6589,Her skin tone makes republicans livid.
Infidel8,"The point is to draw some equivalence between both sides.

Like when they inevitably impeach Biden over BS, they will pretend that it is the same a Trump getting impeached for his role in a terror attack on the Capitol or extorting a geopolitical ally.

""Both presidents were impeached, so there is no difference."""
TheOvercusser,Republikkklan gonna Republikkklan
Sad-Stranger8447,So cancel culture huh
UnitGhidorah,The white supremacist party took a non-white from a committee. That's unexpected.
