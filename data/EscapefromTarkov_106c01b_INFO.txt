{"Title": "This game is seriously just not worth the bulls**t it comes with anymore.", "Post Text": "EDIT: For the love of God, you don't have to agree with what I say here at all. But if you're gonna be an asshole, at least be bothered to read the whole post. This post is NOT just about the cheating issue. Stop cherry picking this post to fit whatever anecdotal evidence you want to give here to further your own views. You enjoy the game, that is fine and I'm happy for you. Stop trying to make everyone who doesn't agree with you feel stupid. \n\nI mean what the fuck are we all playing for anymore. Those very few, and I mean *very* few highs you can get with this game still? When most of the time you go in kitted now on Lighthouse, Shoreline, or Labs you're almost guaranteed to get dropped by a blatant cheater. \n\nYou dump dozens of hours a wipe doing the same quests you have multiple times already to finally get max traders and have fun only for the game population to have died significantly by that time, running around aimlessly looking for actual PvP where we abuse the same stupid peekers advantage and shit audio that hasn't only remained the same but continuosly gotten worse over time. All while dealing with wonderfully immersive features such as malfunctions, single use keys, changes supposed to prevent RMT and cheating that don't help at all and just make the game harder for everyone else, aimbot AI that still isn't fixed after how many wipes now... I could be here all day.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake is I can't even get a simple tweet or mass e-mail about when something as simple as a fucking Christmas tree is being deleted from the game so my resources don't go to waste. \n\nI'm just so damn tired of all the downsides for the very little upsides. There's nothing out there like Tarkov, and that used to mean something in the best way possible. But I fear the opposite is true now and whatever vision Nikita/BSG have for this once promising game is just gone. \n\n1700hrs+ here and I'm officially out. Maybe I'll come back for Arena, but my faith and expectations in this company have completely fallen and I fully expect that to be a flaming shit show too.\n\nJust remember if you want to try to chime in to defend this cock-and-ball torture simulator, we're going to be going on *7 years* of this game this year, and THIS is where we're at. \n\n/rant", "ID": "106c01b", "Score": 3272, "Total Comments": 1340, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/106c01b/this_game_is_seriously_just_not_worth_the_bullst/"}
