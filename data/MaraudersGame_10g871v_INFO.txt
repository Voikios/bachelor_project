{"Title": "Feature request: Allow rigs to be stored in containers/bags", "Post Text": "As of now, it's a huge pain to have multiple chest armour pieces that have storage, e.g. Plate Rigs or Leather Jerkins. They are the only item than can't be put inside bags or containers, since bags can at least be folded and stored. This means that not only do you have to have space set aside in your stash specifically for a rig if you want to craft one, but you can also never bring more than one rig out of a raid. So unless you go into a raid with storage-less armour and drop it for a rig, you'll never be able to keep any in backup. Came in with a plate rig and found a Panzer Rig? Tough luck, can only keep one of them, that Radio Backpack ain't helping you.\n\nEven if they could be placed in other containers, they couldn't be abused for space, since no rigs can fit inside themselves. Technically a Leather Jerkin could fit inside a BA Flak Vest, but only once, and that could be prevented by a \"no rigs inside of rigs\" rule if need be. Or, if they allowed rigs to be \"folded\" or \"flattened\" to fit inside of a bag, that would be fine as well. A Panzer Rig already takes up a 4x5 of space, so it's not like it would be easy to carry out of a raid.\n\nOn a side note, it would also help to allow market/contract rewards to be put inside of containers if there is space in them. Otherwise you would still need at least a ~5x5 empty space in your stash to fit the big item rewards.", "ID": "10g871v", "Score": 61, "Total Comments": 22, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/10g871v/feature_request_allow_rigs_to_be_stored_in/"}
