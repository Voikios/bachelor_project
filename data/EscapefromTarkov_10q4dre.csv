Losnah,"I feel ur pain, i spent over a week farming shoreline looking for a leddy. Got so over it went to labs and found one at parking button. Since u have black, id just recommend playing labs cus its prolly the highest chance u will find one ngl"
TheHapah,"[https://streamable.com/smxv4h](https://streamable.com/smxv4h)

  Last 15min of an Interchange, my third SCAV run of the wipe, which was about 6 days in? She sat there on that table, and just waited for me to come along and carry her outta that terrible mall. 

  I think all of us feel like you though, for one reason or another. As someone with a full time job, I hate skills in this game. Feels like I'll just never reach elite on one, and the bonuses are so nice."
hiddencamela,"I didn't realize how lucky I was to find my ledx early and hoard it away (not using it in med 3).    
I found it out of a med bag or cache somewhere, and was pretty sure I'd never see another one."
Mediocre-Soil9792,In all my wipes since 2017 never found 1 single ledx in raid
Agent5109,I found a ledex in a barrel stash on interchange
GrapeGang19,It actually takes 26 runs……
Honest-Ruin-1277,"Weird, when I make this post a couple weeks ago I just get instantly downvoted and flamed. Strange redditors ready to defend the game, but then when others finally get to the same place they realise how dog it is."
DukeLander,"And yet, 3rd day of wipe we had guys on flea who have sold 25x ledxs... So its simple, we are just noobs..."
Sturmbrecher64,"Have you considered just being faster? I have seen a guy post up 20 LedXs at once on the Flea, so he probably just beats you to the punch at those loot spots! /s"
russianrebound,I've played about 3 years now. I've never found a ledex. Only ever crafted it.
FistsoFury,"Look up stash run guides for various maps and just run those. Loot up, make some monies and one will pop up eventually. It's either that or spam resort  50 more times"
SleazyHermit,"Damn. I guess I was lucky getting ledx in the one black keycard run I did today. I finally caved in after doing god knows how many runs in shoreline, both scav and pmc with no luck.

Bought black keycard and found it first try."
Cactus1986,"It’s the roadblock type quests that stop me from coming back. Making a game “grindy” does not make it “hardcore”. It makes it stupid and not fun. The game should be about the brutal combat, punishing your mistakes and rewarding your IQ. Instead, it’s turned into a mobile game that simply rewards those who sink the most time into it. As an example, the Bitcoin farm is simply a mechanism to fuel daily logins. “Oh shit, need to login to refuel my farm and pull out my 3 Bitcoin so it keeps producing.” It’s truly lost its way."
ButterMakerMoth,First 2 weeks in wipe I found 4 ledex rbwtween resort and airdrops. How many have I survived with? Well.... *I don't wanna talk about*
Ktm_my_life,"I found one at lvl 10, my mate found 2 in duffle bags on customs. Total RNG."
tiny_blair420,If you've done all of those things 1 month into wipe I think something else might be ruining your enjoyment of this game.
Maxos43,I loose enjoyement when quest becoming stupidly hard :/
Tresorsee,"I found one in West 301, that I could not pick up. I even tried reconnecting. Oh boi was I unhappy…"
xRamee,Interchange has LEDX spawns both in the open and behind keys/pwr. It also has less cheaters then both of the maps you mentioned.
frolie0,"While I actually agree, how is not getting a THICC case slowing your progression? It's a nice QoL improvement, but has zero impact on your progression."
djn808,I got mine in a duffel bag
Kalsyum,"Dont enjoy it.

Leave.

Thanks in advance"
CatLooksAtJupiter,"If you bang your head on a wall once and it hurts, maybe it's you who is the dumb one for banging it another 49 times and not the wall."
Rockyrock1221,Airdrops…
PatThaCat,"You are not checking every single LedX spawn, im on 7 Ledxs after 50 shoreline runs. There are like 4 unlocked rooms in the resort that have ledx spawns too that you should be checking"
SnareXa,"they are not making you do anything, you can play the game at this point"
bwheatley,Preach it
RippemRickems,"I am almost through uses on the popular resort keys searching for a ledx and have yet to find one. Starting to get a bit annoyed by it. Previously I didn’t have this issue in other wipes, granted they were not every run, but I found 2 or 3 per key uses."
AlternateImageGaming,"Now would not be the time to mention my scav spawned with one on like the 3rd day of wipe, would it? 

Me being awful aside, I definitely feel for you. I'm not pushing for lightkeeper, but I do love those thicc cases for hoarding loots, so I'd be pretty frustrated if I had to do crazy stuff to get one and then not."
bufandatl,Found a LedX in a hidden stash on shoreline day 1 and made 800k excluding the LedX that raid. Was one of my best in a long time. But the LedX ground stash I had last three wipes. No need to buy 6 Mio keys. Also had LedX in rooms you don’t need keys for in resort. Most PMC and Scavs don’t loot those so late raid as Scav or PMC checking those is always worth.
batl_axe_warrior,Sounds like awful rng I got a ledx in 226 first open amd second got one for myself and gave the second to my duo
JakorPastrack,"I found one in a stash first wipe day lol. Also, loot jackets, you dont need to buy the keys, i got most shoreline keys from the town nearby."
Rezhyn,"I am finding Ledx like candy this wipe. At a certain point it's really just bad luck and they want it to be a special item you grind for. Almost everything in this game nowadays is just ""farm rubles"". 

Have you seen some of the LK tasks? If finding a Ledx is driving you crazy you will lose your mind doing any of that stuff. I'd much rather find a Ledx and play the game naturally."
x_GeGe,I've found 3 ledx on labs yesterday
Tap1oka,I found a ledx in a sports bag. I have the clip!
kasabian-7,"I usually scav on Interchange and found mine in a drop late game with nobody coming for it. Even had time to dc and back cuz it was glitched with no ""loot"" prompt coming up. Always worth risking it if you have nothing of value on you I say! Good luck bud"
falconn12,Skill issue /s
Ronananana,"Assuming they didn't change the spawn rates with the wipe, you are astronomically unlucky to go black room on labs 15 times without seeing one, last wipe when I got black keycard I was finding one in there more or less evey 6 or 7 raids on average, that room is insane"
aQuarterChub,"I have found 3 in orange med boxes this wipe. I haven’t seen a single one in their spawns, except once on a scav that someone missed in 301"
ImaginaryAI,Sounds better to just craft it at that point. That’s my plan
Internal-Manager-203,"Just managed to get mine via med airdrop i called in as a player scav, ran shoreline rooms before this to basically get most of my loot from duffles and medbags, feels like loose loot in general is a bit tame than it used to be"
Zeroa2572,That is rough.
TheFunkadelicOne,I found one in a duffel bag on interchange lol
shittyrivets,Dude i still havent completed chemical or lend lease ill skip all his quests before i pay 600k per key.
dontdonit,Honestly found mine in interchange not behind doors
DolanMack,"I found my 1 LEDX this wipe in a medical bag on the Scav Barge on Shoreline lol, luck is a bitch"
BaziJoeWHL,Do you run moonshine case ? They can get you one.
hiidkwatdo,2 days straight on shoreline. Fucking sucked dog. No amount of cope will make me think it was ok.
Oknamehere_4980,"Literally didn't try to find one and opened up the door under idea and found one, must suck lol"
zen111,"Meanwhile I have found around 12 in total this wipe, all on Shoreline - mainly in 301 but also anywhere in Resort, like med bags, med crates, duffle bags. I feel like there’s always a leddy in the Resort, you just got to search it all."
Joesthatguy,I found one last wipe in resort in a duffle bag on the top floor of one of the wings. Cant remember where exactly since I'm not familiar with shoreline. I was a scav.
ChestBroadshoulder,I found a ledx on my 4th resort visit in a medbag in an unlocked room.
Xenoph0ntis67,"Played 4-5 wipes ao far, and I've only ever found 2 ledx in raid.


Both were in dufflebags on interchange.


I don't understand"
InvisibleZero420,W205 is a ledx spawn key too.  300k on the flea though :(
Lllamanator,Found 3 in my past 10 or so shoreline runs. twice in w311 and once in e226.
StoppedKarma,"I've hit 301 and tape key over a dozen times with no Leddy. I actually found mine in a gym bag in the Idea office on Interchange (the one on the couch). I agree though,  I think the whole lightkeeper grind is insane for something that was hyped up over two wipes. I've put 3400 hours into this game over 5 wipes and I have no intention of grinding through that bullshit. I feel bad for the people that don't have 700 hours a wipe a dedicate to the game, having a life has locked them out of content."
Lukrativ_,I got mine in my 3rd scav case. Only one I've found
DvstRGaming,"You might want to consider the approach to it like I did.
instead of counting on RNG on maps you're not enjoying, count on the RNG of the scav case.
Got mine on a moonshine one, while leaving me able to play the other maps that i wanted and needed, and not choreline farming nor labs.

Only part i'm considering now is labs for the GPS but, time will tell on that.
Wish you good luck on it."
Kivble,i found mine in west 301
General_Gopnik27,"4th wiper, never have I ever actually found a ledx, to be fair I’m a pretty casual player and only ever checked shoreline spawns."
PolarPole,I’ve found 3 in ultra med this wipe. Probably ran the room about 40 times
Ace17125,That’s fucked. Hopefully a shitty Reddit award makes you better. Prob not though. GL in your hunt.
alecl12,Just get better
alecl12,"This post is fucking stupid, it’s part of the game get good or don’t fucking play! Quit be a complaining bitch"
SufficientMany6989,"I found my first LedX from a duffle bag in Interchange. Was the fastest ""okay lets gtfo"" moment ever"
NotEax,Found a ledx finally at level 36… next raid… another ledx. The curse of never finding then they show up all the time has struck. I found mine in interchange back of goshan on the table by the vehicles and large weapons box.
arryouhappy,"I still can't seem to find a thumb drive, let alone two of them."
KevitoMG,Or just don't do stuff you don't enjoy. I'm not even max traders and already stopped questing.
ArkhamRobber,Welcome to Tarkov
Daisy_Bloodworth,*Starts laughing manically while looking at the LEDx in his junk box that's waiting for him to reach the quest*
alcoholicprogrammer,"First wipe in while where I'm not expecting to get my thicc case, feelsbadman"
Conserliberaltarian,"Try interchange, Veritas found a ledx in ultra med this wipe, so they ARE spawning there, just more rarely. It's almost never hit either. They also have a chance to spawn in Emercom medical, Mantis, and pharmacy. Keys are all super cheap in comparison and Interchange is full of 20k per slot loot for money."
murrkpls,This is the most \*boo hoo\* post in the history of this sub.
mikeyboy1681,"For anyone who can hear this, run scavs on nighttime shoreline. Tons of loot to yourself, I find a dead player and have found sanitary dead + player multiple times."
Addicted2Moola,I just started and found a ledx on Customs
EmpireStateOfBeing,"Just fyi, they spawn in stashes and duffles more this wipe so all that money you spent wasn’t necessary."
tortugaman5,Dude just stop playing it.
_vfbsilva_,I got a ledx on a Pink case in interchange as a scav. Gpus in The other hand seem to be missing.
BUFFWarthog,"I found a LEDX in an air drop.

However, I'm deadlocked in quests right now at level 14 because I can't find the keys to progress them like the Tarcone key and the dorm key for the paramedic therapist quest. I can't get the parts for the gun for gunsmith past level 1 either. It's maddening."
Jugo0,Well at least is better than being stuck in Punisher part 4 and that's me in this wipe
hiddenintheleavess,"boohoo. i am so sick of seeing people complain about not finding RARE fucking items. these changes push people to play Labs, a map that has been killed and empty for wipes now. take the journey and enjoy the ride, your PMC wont shrivel up and die if it takes an extra week or 2 to level up your hideout. all of this complaining is egregious as fuck"
MastaSplintah,Mained labs last wipe. Found so many ledxs and searched enough duffle bags on labs I found 2 ledxs in duffle bags.
DylanBaker7,I have found more than half of my LEDX at East Wing 209 which is an unlocked room. They spawn right on the end table when you walk in.
LilBooop,Everytime I see one of these ledx posts no one ever mentions the room where they spawn at least 20% of the time for me.
Evading_A_Suspention,I still haven't found a measuring tape I feel you man it's been 40 raids :(
ChilesIsAwesome,My scav spawned with one day 1 of wipe. I’ll never get that lucky again.
Hardcore_Ghost_Fan,"I just got flea market, I've only gotten Kappa once before, I'm looking forward to never seeing any of the late game content this wipe"
BoAR3D,This game Is stupid. Period.
GloryOrValhalla,All of my resort ledx keys are 20/40 and I’ve found 2 ledx so far. Just bad luck streak man.
Lawzenger,I swear i get a ledx every second black room hit lol
BigChombo,"Most wipes, I'll just gamble with the scav box and usually get lucky.. eventually"
cbarnett010,people who play this game and post on reddit are insufferable.
justiceclark96,"I'm lvl 17, found a LedX in a random airdrop on customs last night. Didn't even know they were special until I saw people complaining about finding them 😅

Edit : spelling"
StatutoryApee,"I've hit 112w and w104 over 250 times and havnt found anything.
 Found plenty of stuff in other rooms though."
somenoefromcanada38,I've complained about tasks so many times on this sub over the years and finished my task that day lol
bscott2018,You're just unlucky bro.....
logskynei,I didn't find classic matches until I reached flea... first wipe so that took a while
threeputtforbogie,I found one in an orange medical bag.  Sorry bud.
Yeffry1994,"I'm so done with peacekeeper man. Fkn Punisher burned me out, I suck so dying over and over trying to get 10 kills takes a toll, peacekeeper shoving shoreline down my throat with spa-tour and just when I think I'm done wet job begins. I always quit when these quests start getting so repetitive. Like mfker, change some of them to diff maps and make them REQUIRED quests to progress, not some random ass quest that's optional. I'm lvl 28 with lv 3 traders on everyone but ragman and I haven't had a NEED to go to any diff map bcuz every quest early on is customs and then its shoreline spam until you bore out and quit the game. My first 10-15 levels were like 90% customs then lvl 15-30 its literally shoreline, shoreline, shoreline, shoreline, shoreline. And wait until I reach OP's situation where I have to run 100 raids on shoreline to find a LEDX for my THICC case lol. I don't think Ill even get there tbh."
Moist_Park_8877,6 million alleged keys
deadd0g,"not the point of the post, but LEDx is actually really rare in black room just FYI, i've seen one in 50+ opens.

majority of my LEDx on labs have come from all the loose tech/rare spawns around the map outside keycard rooms."
Aegis_Sinner,This just seems much like an mmo. With the full loot risk. Some days the rng gods of tarky favor us. Others we can go weeks dry for that particular drop we need.
HectorBandz,"Dude you think a ledx hard to find, try looking for a spark plug….."
Claptonisawesome,Please. They should just bring back the damn craft. Maybe spice it up. I would be willing to loose a couple million on the craft for private clinic. But this just dead end blocks the game.
miskaM7,Meanwhile I bought tape key for an extra ledx room for 800k.  Got a ledx and extracted first use of the key.
Herper_Derpo,"I’ve found with tarkov, if you complain hard enough, then you’ll find what you’re looking for"
Cpt_sneakmouse,"Whole game is a grind, if the shooter components weren't as compelling as they are this game would be the fps equivalent of a Korean f2p mmorpg."
pte_omark,"So what everyone isn't saying is that the crafts for ledx, cofdm, virtex and rfid readers are now locked behind lightkeeper tasks (pretty deep in too).

It would be good if people would explain what they mean instead of just saying 'you can't craft it'."
thebananuhman,I just picked one up as q acav and got killed by a player scav.
EastAd9769,This is a lie for sure lol
shifty_85,I'm over 120 raids in and still need to find my 2nd gas analyzer 🙄😒
samcn84,2nd moonshine scav case this wipe brought me a ledx......
QuietSuch2832,"I know no one cares but this is what made me quit. I got addicted to Tarkov like I hadn't been addicted to a game in at least 10 years. I loved it. Then last wipe I decided to try and finish my boss quests. Couldn't get bossed to spawn at a reasonable rate (200+ shoreline, 300+ woods and saw Shturman 4 times and sanitar 0.) That was the beginning of my burnout.

This wipe I got horrible luck on salewas despite checking the known spawns. My last gas analyzer was tough too. Because all things are balanced, I DID get my flash drives very quickly. But then we suddenly needed a sledgehammer so get rid of the stupid hideout debuffs. My friends all kept finding them and telling me where they saw it. This never happened for me. I checked reddit for the spawn locations. Slammed them. The only time I was even close to getting it was a raid with 3 friends where they snagged one for me but we ended up dying. Eventually you could purchase it on the flea.

But the above is what finally did me in. I have a pretty busy life but make time for games if they keep me engaged. I can even make extra time if a game is really pulling me in. What I can't justify is wasting countless hours running around pulling a slot machine lever praying to hit the jackpot so I don't keep falling behind. It just feels so artificial and unfair. When I post stuff like this I always get replies like ""lol idk man I found it easy!!!"" Like yeah, that's the random part of RNG. I found my flash drives insanely early, 2 in 1 jacket. But when you need that luck to happen 6 separate times to move through the wipe it gets old. I'd rather there be static spawns so we can have some epic battles.

TLDR the artificial progression lock via RNG is bad. If it takes me 100 hours to get level 2 traders it should be a skill issue, it shouldn't be because of bad luck."
Kilo-Nein,"Honestly, if they just made LEDX on all maps and far more common it would resolve this issue, and put a massive dent in the hacker issue.

Stop making shit artificially rare."
saint5678,hit them burried stashes
dimsumdonair2,"Shoreline in general is just a shit map 


But ledx spawns need to be increased like the opthomoloscopes"
DedlyYetti,"i have done shoreline around 100 times, i have also used up almost every key i have i have 3 runs left on my 301 key.  i used many different ledx room keys.  only found a single ledx after around 40 hours or so of farming it"
officerpompadour,"Tahts rough man, I found mine in a bag in the garages of interchange. I'm hoping for you"
Rootorii,"Not sure if you have W311(not locked) included in your route, but i found mine in it. (around my 35# shoreline run)  


And yes i agree it is kind of stupid to have ledx craft locked behind the lightkeeper."
bbplayer514,"In 3 and a half wipes, I have ran labs 3 times. The amount of talk of the map being notorious for cheaters plus learning the map in itself has put me off from it. Shoreline is fine honestly for the most part but it and Interchange have had moments where we 100% ran into cheaters who were blatant (actually trying to shoot us through 2 walls without magic bullets even). I guess from Rust to Tarkov, I've given up on the ""the game will get better with cheaters soon"". 

Like we need a robotic Camomo_10. It's sad that you could make daily videos of cheaters being caught in Rust alone which Tarkov might rival in concurrent players so the numbers could be the same with the amount of cheaters, though each game has their own reasons for cheating. I don't know. I think the whole drama with can't find a LEDX could be avoided by the simple fix that needs to be done. Put back in the craft for the LEDX. What does it hurt? Progression? To what? It's not even artificially slowing it down like lowering chances for gas analyzers or hunting matches like they did. They completely removed a craft to honestly gatekeep Lightkeeper for streamers and people who play this game hardcore to hide him longer. That's literally all they did it for."
28022006,"my friend found them back to back in W301, died both times"
LittleArrArr,"What progression? You can hit max traders without finishing private clinic.

You mean lightkeeper? The one locked behind tons of endgame content? How is that progression? And shouldn’t something in the game be actually hard to achieve?"
BeefyZealot,But that guy on flea has 30 ledx for sale…
Gullible_Reply,It's called C.H.E.A.T.E.R.S.
Zavodskoy,Meanwhile I found 2 ledx's and a GPU on shoreline at like level 11 before I found a single gas analyser or flash drive
DragonsEmber,This is my 5th wipe. Ive NEVER seen a ledx. I always crafted. This wipe i ran scavs on shoreline in my spare time. 2 days ago i got lucky. 5 min left in raid. I had to extract resort. Figured i run though to admin basement. Thought most of resort would be picked by now so why bother. Running past the ambulance out front to get to admin and saw a ibuprofen on the back edge by the open door. Stopped and backtracked to grab it. As i picked it up i notoced the ledx sitting next to it. Difficult to see against that black background of the ambulance bed. Grabbed it up and Booked it to admin basment.  One of the higher tarkov moments for me.  That THICC case is real noice!
oriaven,So it's barely slowed your progression because you just refused to be slowed down and just no-lifed through it.
Travellinjackttv,I feel like this is me with flash drives every wipe. This wipe I got kinda lucky though.
nicainNull,"Ive found two ledx's this wipe.  Done thirty taped key and thirty 301 visits.

Whats crazy is one of my ledx finds was in the unlocked E second floor rooms as a scav. 

I wouldnt mind the low spawn rate if you could craft them, but we know whats going on there."
isad0rable,I traded the chek whatever # key for taped key. I’ve never regretted a decision more in this game
SlySanity,"Found 3 in 10 raids on shoreline yesterday. Make sure to hit med bags and bags in general, one was found in the med bag on the balcony of the room right just right of the stairs on the 3rd floor west far end."
Lactancia,Apparently stashes is the way to go for ledx this wipe.
Dr_Cannibalism,"I at level 44 and am stuck on Lend Lease Part 2. Haven't seen a COFDM or a Virtex all wipe. It's the only quest in the way of me starting the Lightkeeper content, as once that's done I can knock out Peacekeeping.

I got my FIR LEDX from an airdrop on Lighthouse as a scav. Another player scav ran up on me while I was searching and put 3 rounds in my face/chest when I turned around. But like in Pulp Fiction, RNGesus came down from the heavens and stopped those bullets, meaning they didn't even damage or connect with me on my end. So I point shot that fuck in the face with my scav FAL and returned to looting the drop, noting my blood on the crate at about head level, despite the fact his shots didn't hit me on my end. I was the chosen one, blessed by our Lord Nikita himself, destined to receive that Leddy. And yay, did I carry that Leddy to victory, leaving that accursed land at the scav grotto."
ShadowZpeak,"My friend: I need a ledx

The first hidden stash he looted: ledx

Me: I think I heard-

*many many angry bullets coming our way*

His pain of looking at that ledx in his secure container, now without FIR status, was almost palpable"
highfiveghost55,Found 3 all in shoreline stashes… hidden caches can spawn anything on any map & are so slept on as people rush high PvP areas to only find scraps of loot
Deltazinho420,Thats why it's the best game.
SpeechBright,"The last three wipes I've ran scav on shoreline and found a ledx. Once in sanitars office, whoever looted it didn't check the shower well enough. Another time was the admin food cart and this wipe I found one in the open room in East, I think 227. That room has a med spawn on the dryer in there."
bubbs1990,"Oddly enough, found a ledex and op scope in the orange medical box in mantis. First time seeing that."
TsKLegiT,I have no luck farming my buddy got a weekly 70 scavs 40m for a ledx. I wish I could be so lukcy.
cjhoser,bro play another game lol go outside
PICT0GRAMJONES,Oh you don't need it anymore? Here's ten.
SneedDeez,"Nikita thinks you're an idiot for playing an unfinished game, so I guess stop playing? Also apparently these are supposed to be grindy side-missions anyway, so once again I guess stop playing? I'm not being an ass, this is genuinely how Nikita feels about the game, he really does think we're all dumbasses for playing his unfinished game and he himself refuses to play it, which would also explain why the game is so fucking shit."
StovnPUBG,Cry more
TECHNOV1K1NG_tv,Love the updates here! Thanks for keeping it honest lol 😂
NabuBot,Down bad on luck. People forget spawn and shut are just number and u just rolled low over and over. Not statistically Impossible. I've seen 3 so far none actually trying to look for them. First one for quest I pulled from a med drop on a scav lmao
Jimmbo-Swaggins,Tarkov's luckiest player
,[removed]
Sultan98,And then there's me who randomly found a ledx in a sports bag
Bearman71,Just remove fir make tarkov enjoyable
WhiteLightWarrior,I got my ledx on my 23rd try of interchange medical by tech light
S34ND0N,Edit 4: I discovered R&G but this time Im mad because the rare thing is rare instead of searching 300 cabinets for one gasan.
vgamedude,I burned myself out getting a ledx and getting private clinic. Haven't booted the game in like 5 days now and if you go that long you might as well just stop (thanks based mobile game mechanics).
Cyuriousity,I got mine from my scav case
Sad_Week9076,"I haven't found a ledx in 3 wipes or whatever it's been since ""dYnAmIc LoOt"" became a thing. I just buy them off flea at this point if I need one, or craft once I have med center"
TNBFM,"Weritas is right.  This self righteous bullshit journey to be 'not call of duty' has ended up making a fat people simulator where you play as nikita not being able to hit fuck all with a gun.

This game is a fucking sham and I want my fucking moey back"
Spamburger_Hamburger,Am I the only one who just crafted any ledx I need for tasks?
Illtakeboffum,Wasting alot of money for something I’ve gotten as a scav lol
catweavex,Pick one up it’s not that hars

OfficialGeeno,"I feel that, except it wasn't ledx's. It was Salewa's. I could not find a Salewa in raid. I was level 14 when I completed that godforsaken turn in quest."
mabinuqi,"Surprised it doesn't contain complaints of hacker, I can't event get to level 15 without funky shit going on"
tk42150,People don't understand dynamic loot spawns. I find ledx in med bags as a scav on shoreline. I think 4 this wipe so far.
ChucklesAcademy,"Found mine in a bag in mantis, couldn't believe it"
Leather_Echidna_4371,"We're a group of 5 and only one of us had a LEDX spawn on Shoreline. Yesterday we ran Shoreline, found another and got it out. Next raid after we get another one, same spot, got it out. Now for me and another guy just looking at Shoreline is vomit inducing, but we need a LEDX each lmao"
Maxprotrad3r,"Smh I don't even need a single key and still found Ledx at:

- Top of the safe in Bitcoin Office
- Server rack near Weapon Testing
- Bottom of the book shelf in office near Parking Control Room

Maybe pure luck but who knows."
M9W123,M9W found a ledx in sani's room
Cr1t1cal_Hazard,"Found one in Mantis last night, just chilling next to a bandage in a med bag"
Kirsutan,That's weird. I've looted 301 less than 10 times and have found 2 ledx from there.
quitesohorrible,"I am just lvl 22 with the standard edition. I found a LedEx as a scav on Shoreline before I unlocked the flea. Was thinking of selling it to Therapist so I could afford to upgrade the stash, but then checked the flea price online and decided to hold.

Was thinking of selling it on flea, but it feels like a found in raid LedEx is worth way more than the flea price. Don't know if I'll ever bother grinding to a point when I will need it though."
CynicalSamster,"I have ran reserve 50 times and rushed bunker before the power is ever turned on to get my final 5th raider kill for prapor.

Standard_Bid_825,"I am struggling to find sewing kits for hide out (lav 2) I am only lv 9 but not sure how many technical crates, duffel bags and caches I wanna open :)"
CristiBlondu89,"Dude, i found mine at level 12 in a med bag on scav island on shoreline"
Dark_Claw_Raven,"it took me a week straight of farming ledx's to get mine, its really rough but once you give up all hope tarkov rewards you, it's literally torture tactics"
Gmbziee,Not supposed to be easy my man. Supposed to be an absolute grind.
TheSm4rtOne,"West 301, east 226 and that one none key room are the best ledx spawns so far. Labs loot got nerfed into the ground this patch for some reason, past wipes the ledx spawnrate was pretty decent on labs"
Riddlein95,I found one in an airdrop on interchange as a scav lmfao
HumaDracobane,"Is the only known way for BSG to (artificially) prolong the game. 

I cant say I'm surprised."
Rincewind799,"I didnt even find the third Salewa needed for first Therapist quest. In 50 hours I found two right at the start and nothing since then. Found a grizzly, IFAKs and an unholy amount of other rare items, but not a single Salewa. Tried the known places on Woods, Customs and Shoreline."
NoFucksDoc,"Git gud, frfr ongawd"
DSizzle84,Yea I hit a wall yesterday that I just did not feel like pushing through. Think I’m done for a while
guligali,i spawned as a scav and can u guess what i had in my backpack :)
squidelvis,I found mine in yellow med box in 306. Must have been some 000000.1 probability.
connorschaun,Found my first and only ledex ever on my first and only labs run of this wipe. It was a much appreciated cash infusion.
iCrazyNoodles,"The more time i’m on this sub, the more i realise the further you get in the game, the stupider it gets. Like wtf i’ve seen 20 posts and 100’s of comments saying they can’t find a ledx for the life of them"
shady531,"Only have 1500 hours in the game. But I've been playing since 2018, every wipe. Only have ever found 1 ledx"
Psyonicg,"I found six last wipe all on scav runs of shoreline. They have a chance to spawn in regular med bags, duffle bags and medical crates. I found 2 already this wipe just hitting every unlocked medical bag, there’s like 20+ of them that most people ignore."
ZaDripo,I found one on the dead scav on the parking or something on interchange
morilynn,if you dont have to teir 3 med station yet if your level 24 make it and craft a ledex for the quest i have only been in hospi twice so far for jammer and marker on the roof  not much reason to go shoreline unless you like it till your over level 20 at all  go do what you like alot of the quest items if you dont find them you can craft most of them now  work on your hideout
justice_Cx,At that point paste a quick screenshot with your keys and their used states. Evidence is key lol
e1vi5,"I found my ledx in a unlocked room, twice"
Sensitive-Original14,Get good ?
stiff_lip,"Been playing this for 5 years and haven't completed all of the quests once. Level 21 now, completed the bare minimum, nothing from peacekeeper or prapor, a couple from Jaeger and am just loading up and having fun. You are kiiling your own enjoyment of the game."
Tagadapwet,"Wait, you Can run labs ? Eu servers are plagued with cheaters, you either get killed through walls head/eyes or triple tapped in the head. Gone to labs 5 or 6 Times and died once or twice legit, 4 times to tarkov prime gamers ...
Got 2 ledx on shoreline tho.
One inside a ledx room bottom floor and one on a sus player i killed outside with just a FIR ledx in his bag..."
TheBobFisher,"I feel your struggle, fonud my first LEDX in 301W after roughly 15 hits and ended up dying to a blatant cheater. Didn't find my Private Clinic LEDX until lv 37 inside Sanitar Tape key after hitting it also about 20 times. I'm on the hunt for the Far-Forward items on labs and have had zero luck after 10+ labs runs however I just obtained Violet and Blue, so I'm hoping this helps my hunt."
BeneficialMix7851,I just want my scav kills but I run into juiced players everywhere I go
Opening_Inside_9054,"ive gotten 5 ledx from shoreline, its not that bad"
Lundhlol,"Crafted one in good old christmas tree. Never gonna use it because the LEDX quest requires level 35, so for people out there paining them selves, ask yourself if you normally reach 35 anyways."
ThatGamingMoment,"This is literally the game. Grind and search for loot.  It's rare and you have to look for it?  Isn't that the game?

I dint understand people wanting them to literally shorten progression because they dislike playing the game?

Go find ur ledx lol"
NHReptiles,"Their chosen method of ""slowing"" progression affects people with jobs and less time to play the most. It's not the right approach. The tryhards will still burn themselves out on the wipe as fast as possible. Having separate ""seasonal"" and persistent non-wipe game modes would fix this. Maybe even shorten the seasons for the streamers/etc."
Anoreth,"all the streamers said the game is great now after all the scandals !  
Why aren't you enjoying it? /s"
dgdgdgdgcooh,just go for air drops my friend
SgtStorelvmo,i always craft the ledx. i can't be arsed to go look for one
Hostagec,No one forces you to do the quests tho
Youdontknowmypickles,Where’d you find the LEDX on labs? I’ve given up on shoreline and now am going to have to main labs I’m afraid to progress
RealEradikate,Im pretty sure most high value loot spawns gets vacuumed by cheaters more often than not. Thats why some items feel like they dont exist
platinums99,"West 205, my first visit. sry pal"
MIKUSiewski,"Just quit the game. It's been ruined long time ago with extremely stupid economy decisions, locking everything behind dumb, grindy quests and cheaters. I just have no clue how retarded must be their head of game design, they did wrong literally everything patches after flea market release (not saying flea is bad for game, I mean opposite - but what they did to flea xD). The game had an incredible potential, yet BSG decided to run it for blind community.

&#x200B;

Just quit the game, it's not worth your time nor money."
DrNacho,I got mine from an air drop on a scav run
_XIIX_,"nobody is forcing you to run labs and shoreline 50 times back to back and buy keys for 6 million  
there is still like 4-5 months left in the wipe."
J1987P,I got my ledx and military battery from 8 scav case moonshine runs
Moehikki,"Well, you just extremely unlucky. In game with rng loot spawn shit happens. 

I dont think every fir quest item should be craftable. For example i'm also struggling with cofdm for lightkeeper quest. Also just unlucky. Also dont have gps transmitter, hate labs, but find it fair enough. You shouldn't be able to progress through all quest just farming money your favourite way and than craft every quest item."
GameTechniqueTV,Just don’t do it? Play the game to have fun
Redhornactual,Just make a lot of money and buy it dingus. Then craft the one you need to the quest.
saltyfr35h,I've found them in Interchange on tables.
,[deleted]
datsadboi69,Not to brag or anything but i got a ledx my first time in 301
Madzai,"Unpopular opinion.

It wouldn't be so frustrating if overall progression was slower, more gradual and we have to make loot runs to get gear. With how the game currently is, anyone with at least some experience can get enough money and gear no problem. Not top tier, as it was before, but not garbage too. So, the only thing standing between you and your goal of Kappa\Lightkeeper\10k PMC kills\L4 traders\whatever are those stupid quests.

If quests weren't the only thing you must worry about people won't be so focused on specific tasks and could do them more ""naturally""."
tronzorb,"I found one in medical tents at goshan and a second one in an unlocked room in resort. They’re out there, it’s RNG too."
jonnyboosock,"I found my first ledx of the wipe in the U by cargo elevator on labs, in one of the small orange med boxes. I don't believe they used to spawn in them, at least not frequently. Maybe try hitting some more less typical med spawns throughout the map, rather than focusing black, might get lucky"
Tiger_Tuller,Found one on my first shoreline run this wipe and have found another 2 so far in about 20 shoreline raids. You must be really unlucky
Jackal_Oddie,"At current time, the fact you need a FIR LEDX is absurd, I'd much rather 5 non fir instead"
Dido_Dtv,I found like 10 ledX this wipe :D
Silentlee2,"2nd time to w301.  2x ledx.

Shrug"
pte_omark,"Buy a ledx from flea to build l3 meditation, craft ledx for private clinic. Crafted items still count as found in raid."
Tankeverket,"I mean, nobody is forcing you to"
Kl3ppy,Found mine at the ambulance at the resort on shoreline. My second one was in a hidden stash on shoreline
RoboticControl187,Have faith bro. I found one on shoreline in a duffle bag near sevitly dead end. The house with the white car in front.
FarTooManyReasons,"I don’t even try to find leddy anymore. Last wipe I found 10 in duffels and caches, so I just don’t even worry myself with key rooms. If/when I find them, I find them. Otherwise, I will lose my mind, and become disenfranchised"
Blacklist3d,This is just luck is it not?  Between 226 and 301 I've found over 10 and have only run the map maybe 30 times.
kamparox,"Ledx and far forward are driving me nuts. I'm legit hitting a brickwall. The weird part I don't see many people talk about is that you can definitely imagine many people paying for carries bc of shit like this, it's so antithetic to what BSG is trying to accomplish by removing RMT."
stelkurtainTM,I mean you don’t *need* to do these things.
