OGDonglover69,R’s are silent about Santos and were glad to have his vote regardless of the little “embellishment” of the past.
OwlintheShadow,Shouldn’t this guy be getting extradited to Brazil?
newnemo,"Putting Santos on *any* committee at this point would be idiotic.

>George Santos should resign from Congress, but should he refuse, Kevin McCarthy must not seat Santos on any committee where he is given access to classified information, according to a letter sent today by CREW.

>Santos’s misrepresentations of large swaths of his background have proven his tendency to lie for power and personal gain. It is clear that he has not demonstrated the trustworthiness necessary to guard our country’s most closely guarded secrets.

Article continues...."
BillySlang,He’s been proven to be one of the biggest political frauds in history - don’t let that stop Kevin McCarthy though…
fowlraul,If that’s even his real name…
BlotchComics,"All it takes is a 2/3rds vote in the House to expel him from congress.

But that would require a majority party with just a little integrity..."
kazejin05,"HE SHOULD NOT BE IN FUCKING CONGRESS. 

That his own party didn't make ousting him their first priority after selecting their Speaker is the biggest indictment as to the sincerity of their pursuit of ""truth and transparency"". As if any more were needed on top of the ones already present."
SpartanKane,"Shouldnt get intelligence information?

...kinda putting the cart before the horse here MAN SHOULDNT EVEN BE IN CONGRESS.

In any normal job you'd be fired. In the government, its optional. God bless America."
ApatheticWithoutTheA,"I wouldn’t be surprised at all to find out he’s a legit foreign intelligence asset.

The FBI and NSA need to be monitoring this asshole 24/7, tails and phone/internet surveillance."
Barack_Odrama_007,Unfortunately he will. Voting truly matters and we do get what we vote for.
azteczulu,He really should be treated as a possible spy and interrogated by the fbi at this point.
TalentedCannaMan,The man should be removed from office immediately.
MagicalUnicornFart,"It's not like being a traitor, seditionist, criminal, or grifter is a barrier to being a member of Congress. 

It seems people are pretty open about being all of those things, and it doesn't matter. It's about making money, and putting yourself above the law. 

We've allowed too much corruption for too long, and it's pretty much the norm, especially for the GOP"
BruceBanning,I think the word for this guy is infiltrator.
ShenmeNamaeSollich,George Santos should not be allowed to stay in the fucking building and should be arrested for multiple counts of fraud.
A_Downboat_Is_A_Sub,"I've had the feeling that he didn't think he would get elected, so he didn't expect the level of scrutiny he is now getting. He's a fraudster, and running for office was just one of his grifts. 

Why not make a bunch of expenditures from campaign money that are exactly below the level where you have to provide receipts? Why not pay some guy $100k to impersonate someone while fundraising? It's not like anyone is probably going go looking to see if you did these things if you lose.

Now he gets a congressional salary, and has whatever campaign money left, but he's caught. He won to lose."
Rka2t,I remember when a democrat senator resigned because he was accused of hugging someone and a congressman at the top of his career resigned because he was too horny and send sick pics. These guys are literal security threat to the country and who knows what else they do but no one even cares.  Is having no dignity a good virtue?  Do we need to teach our kids to be like them to make it in life?
Dontuselogic,Hes absolutely  going to sell it
twesterm,"Doesn't he have to get security clearance to view this information even if he's sat on a committee that views secure information?

I'd assume that if security clearance was required for his role then he would be pretty fucked if he lied on that. Even if he was completely honest on his clearance form I really don't see how given his past he would be granted any sort of clearance. I get how Trump and his inner circle skirted this, but Santos doesn't have the benefit of daddy President _(though he'd probably tell you he does)_."
internetbrowser23,"Much like how the intel community eventually just stopped giving trump goods, they should absolutely not hand over any info to gym jordan, santos, mtg or any maga loon who would sell that info to the highest bidder or just put it on twitter uncensored."
Venomking999,What a fucking shame.
Snapingbolts,Why? I hear he was actually a high up at the CIA and FBI earlier in his career. /s
radicalporotta,"If God himself chose to not give him any intelligence, then who are we to attempt the same."
Skybombardier,"Funny how the only thing we the people can do about this is watch in horror, or complain to a representative who most likely can’t do anything about it except, I don’t know, make a public gesture of disapproval or something. Really seems like voting does less with each election when shit like this just erupts right afterward"
Major_Magazine8597,"Santos should be investigated for campaign violations.    Where DID that $700,000 come from, two years after he got evicted (twice) for not paying rent?"
Zilreth,"to be fair, if he shares any of it no one will believe him"
dnph,1000% agree….
zyqzy,This guy is a predator sociopath of the highest order who can outdo even trump in his own game.
Interesting-Month-56,"no, no give George Santos intelligence information. Then have an agent waiting right outside his office to offer to buy it."
Cb6cl26wbgeIC62FlJr,"Republicans are brazen. Expecting the tiniest bit of integrity from republicans is idiotic from democrats. Santos could be the future Gaetz, Hawley or Jordan."
chouettelle,It’s completely mind boggling how this fraudster made it into congress and how is there is absolutely no mechanism to remove him. How is that even possible???
Gorilla1969,"Of course he shouldn't, but he probably will. Nothing matters any more. We're all fucked."
LAESanford,"Anyone receiving intelligence information should have to have security clearances appropriate for that info, including whatever background checks that entails"
athensugadawg,This SOB should get a prison cell.
sunnydaysahead2022,Trump already sold everything -
Competitivedude32,">Santos’s misrepresentations of large swaths of his background have proven his tendency to lie for power and personal gain. 

But this is what republicans look for in their candidates."
cmgchamp2,"You think?   They just detected a deadly uranium shipment at Heathrow tonight.

And here you think these bickering, childish and vengeful Repubs now running Congress have any idea what the impact of this news could mean?

They're still too busy down at the drinking hole celebrating all their new investigation committees to go after  those who are investigating them....and Hunter's laptop for good measure.   Perhaps they'll find some good pornos there...but I doubt it'll help school them on nuclear threats that they can't be bothered with.

Right Repubs?"
shapu,"Why not? Hes a goddamn *asset* to our counterintelligence efforts! I mean, he is such an incredible liar that nobody would believe a word that he says"
OldMaidButler,Give him some fake info and see what he does with it
AceCombat9519,Has to be done because he might have donors linked to Russia and Bolsonaro's Brazillian Far-Right Network. Remember that the True leader of the GOP Donald Trump supported Bolsonaro over Biden & Obama's ally [Lula the Most Popular Politician](https://www.newsweek.com/brazils-lula-most-popular-politician-earth-79355)
trite_post,"This dude goes from //allegedly// committing fraud in Brazil to admitting to fraud here in the US.

So the best plan is to sit him in Congress.  obv"
oilybarbour,Honestly F the people of his district for voting him in cause I hate that this is news
alexbeeee,Why isn’t there some kind of ethics law for politicians who get caught lying entirely about who they are??
karl1776,Meanwhile house GOP hamstrings the ethics  board
CousinSkeeter89,I disagree. Give him the UFO/alien stuff. Hes got a big mouth so he’s bound to let something slip
Dyronya,"I can NOT believe this clown is still a Rep.  Any other job in the labor market, he is instantly terminated.  This weren't some minor embellishments.  These were outright lies!  Multiple!"
Forward-Rest-1217, I don't think he should get a free pass on his crimes either.
coolmon,George Santos belongs in prison not Congress.
GoofyTunes,"It's appalling that he can lie about his entire education, work experience, family history, and campaign funding AND KEEP HIS POSITION. In literally any other job he would be fired and barred from working there for life. And people are moving onto ""well, we can't let him sit on any important committees."" If he's allowed to remain in office, this sets a precedent. More people will do this in the future because they know, even if they are exposed, there are no consequences. He needs to be REMOVED from office and sent to prison for defrauding the USA. We should not budge on this issue."
bluebastille,"First off, putting ""George Santos"" and ""intelligence"" in the same sentence is semantically incongruous."
teddytwelvetoes,"lol we already gave it all to Donald fucking Trump and all of his friends, family, and acquaintances for half a decade or so without issue. what, our entire government is gonna have an epiphany because of Bozo #395732 in this never-ending saga?"
BeowulfsGhost,That deserves a big ol’ upvote.
IAmRules,"This guy is making us Brazilians look bad. 

// googles Brazil 

Ohhh"
solrosenbergv1,How is it legal for him to keep his job?
invisiblefireball,"I mean, should any of them?"
Daviewayne,"Obviously, Republicans won't remove him because holding that seat is more important to them than integrity. But, could they censure him? Is that a thing in congress?"
AFQpro,"Please! The Republicans are so busy changing the rules to suit themselves and to protect their own, like Santos, do you really expect them to do  anything that is common sense?"
Aggressive-Will-4500,He shouldn't even get unintelligent information.
Hefty-Field-9419,I would trust a bartender more than this Republican inbred
magician_8760,"For once, I agree with what this sub posts lol"
Lopsided-Wealth-3899,You all might call him names and a f laying sb. But I’ll think he might be an acting paid spy.
orangeorchid,How could this doofus ever get a security clearance?
Midnight_Barbara,"He will. The DoJ and FBI simply do not give a shit. They didn’t when he was allowed to be sworn in, they didn’t care while literal insurrectionists were sworn in, and they aren’t now as the same insurrectionists start protecting themselves from consequences. The American people have been betrayed by everyone in our government with the power to put an end to this insane qonservative bullshit."
Sosuperbad,"Even more terrifying is the fact that the source of his money is completely unknown. He is the most plant that ever was planted. The only question is, ""who owns him?"""
Tired8281,"Just give him fake info.  That's fair, right?"
Jerrymoviefan3,The committee chairmen have been picked and none involved in intelligence would pick Santos.
Goodly88,"Not just him, but a good 90% of the GOP as a whole shouldn't."
zootsuitbeatnick,he shouldn't be in the house at all
TheBigPhilbowski,"He'll 100% sell it. This is all happening in slow motion, are there really no checks and balances left?"
rocketpack99,They should randomly give George Santos false intelligence information and track what happens to it.
lew_rong,George Santos? The same George Santos that ran the Culper Ring for Washington back during the Revolutionary War?
urbantroll,I mean he shouldn’t be in office so……..
HoodieGalore,"This is the shit everyone forgets while they’re waving away all the campaign buffoonery. We all already know politicians lie like it’s their fucking job because, well, part of politicking is saying whatever you need to in order to get shit done. 

It’s the sheer fucking stupidity of it, the blatant dumb as a box of rocks bullshit. He’s “Jew-ish”? The fuck has our government become, a stand-up tight five? And to lie about such obviously pertinent issues as Semitic heritage and LGBT representation? 

*And then he wants in on potentially sensitive intelligence information, pertinent to national security?*

This dude is a fucking bozo and the fact that he hasn’t been ridden right the fuck out of D.C. on a rail, tells me everything I need to know about this newest crop of crap. Welcome to 2023, the same old shitshow we’ve always had, but now with a lemon fresh scent."
Lettucereditt,He should not be seated.
WT1961,Conservative Christians would knowingly support Satan himself if you put an R beside his name.
xoomboom,Only stupid information
Dyanaya,Lying sack of GOP hypocrisy on parade. A fraud. Another disgusting cheat who needs to be exposed and called out as such at every turn.
AuthenticImposter,I’m surprised there isn’t a recall mechanism
TopCheesecakeGirl,"Yes but perhaps an intelligence implant. As in, he doesn’t have much and needs some urgently."
KuatosFreedomBrigade,"Think this guys just going to be around long enough to make some quick money selling his elected power, and then write a crappy book about his experience when the money runs out"
Choice_Voice_6925,"Imagine being such a shitty human that you make other right wingers look ""not as bad""."
Samurai_gaijin,"""George Santos"" should be removed from office immediately."
legalstep,Is his name even George Santos?
WaffleBlues,"It doesn't matter anymore.  The house is packed full of lunatics, liars and self-indulging traitors.  Seriously, what does one more idiot mixed in even matter?

From Gaetz to MTG and Boefart. This is what Republicans want."
Radeon3,"I’m no lawyer, but could somebody sue Congress with the claim that santos is stealing money from American taxpayers based on lies he told to get the job? How is this any different than lying to get paid in any other way?"
ilovecheaptrick,"He should be removed from office. Like, the fuck?"
Reese9951,"How does this guy get to keep his job? Any other job where you are caught blatantly lying about your qualifications, you are fired from"
PhysicalPolicy6227,No amount of information will make him intelligent.
fiestyoldbat,"Why limit this restriction to George Santos?  MTG, Bobert, Gym Jordan, and a host of others should be excluded from any committee that handles intelligence info. Put all these ""duly elected"" miscreants in a room and seal it off."
TheseLipsSinkShips,The “intelligence” Santos gets should be limited to… how to survive at Rikers.
Narrator-to-gods,"Why not? He was elected. If the dipshits in New York want to start voting like the arseholes in Texas and Florida, let them. Let them get the same idiotic leadership they have in the Hicksville world locations like backwater toxic land In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, moronville basically. 

Americans aren’t going to learn on their own, they’ve proven it. Who the F even elects a SINGLE Republican after damn near the whole group was part of the US coup attempt? Who does that? An idiot. An abject moron. And that’s what the US is filled with and their trajectory is all but called for."
CrumbsAndCarrots,"150 GOP house members should not get intel. 2 dozen gop senators should not get intel. The previous president should not have gotten intel. 
  
I’m honestly bummed that our deep state isn’t as deep as we thought. Some pussy ass deep state apparatus allowing right wing fascists who cozy up to Russia to overthrow our democracy."
VanceKelley,"trump should not have gotten intelligence information. But he did.

Because 'murica!"
Di20,Some intelligence is required to receive intelligence reports.
Champagne_of_piss,I keep reading it as George Soros
TintedApostle,whoops this will now happen...
CockPissMcBurnerFuck,And he comes six years of articles like this.
,[removed]
Cobbler63,"At this point, I think we can assume US intelligence information is scattered to the winds. Trump had reams of documents at his private residence. Now, it appears Biden had documents at his office from VP days. Multiply that by hundreds of other elected officials who have access, and it’s easy to see the fall out."
C9316,"None of them should if we're being honest, they aren't even required to get a security clearance. Their access is granted solely by virtue of getting a bunch of idiots to vote them into office."
justforthearticles20,No Republican should receive intelligence information.
SadGeorgeWashington,"Yeah, neither should I."
lesternessman4,No shit
GTL_Reflex,He’s a republican and republicans control the House. He’s gonna get it all and be terrible for national security.
Emmerson_Brando,"Even if he told it to anyone, they may think he’s lying about it."
Playful_Squash_1611,Ya think?
ThrowawayAccountCum,Am I mistaken? Didn’t this guy resign?
Limp-Dentist4437,He’s been in Brazil and he clearly did some fraudulent Shit there too then came here and defrauded the American people of his congressional district and the US government election process who knows who this guy is in bed with and where he got soo much money from
Emotional-Coffee13,This F’ing F
Honky_Stonk_Man,There is no reason the GOP should hold onto this guy. They will still have a majority without him. If they wish to make strides with the American people they should reject him.
Responsible_Tell1589,This dude’s a walking national security risk.
Dr_ChungusAmungus,What all has he lied about? Do we even know what is truth from fiction yet?
Neorio1,The rent is too damn high
zdiddy987,I first thought this said George Soros and I agreed
albanymetz,I think all republicans should get intelligence and information.
DawgPound919,"I mean, he couldn't pass a background check. 
""Please state your name for the record."" 
""I'd rather not."""
Sekora_IO,Why…it’s unlikely people would believe him if he spilled secrets
Fit-Firefighter-329,I suspect he already has access to it.
Widdlebuggo,He also shouldn’t get a committee seat :’))))
sandysea420,I don’t trust any Republican to get any intelligence information.
lordofsurf,This man would sell it for a 2 piece and a biscuit.
robonsTHEhood,"Well, duh!"
leroy4447,He is a foreign plant
FirmestSprinkles,why not keep it on-brand and give him false information???
CitySeekerTron,This guy's uncle worked for Nintendo.
thrust-johnson,Run it by the House Ethics Committee
AlmondCigar,Sure he should! Very useful to feed Misinformation because I’m sure he’ll sell it.
PristineNoodles,That’s the bar low?
PythagoreanBiangle,"George Santos shouldn’t get financial, military, justice, or any information that he or people he interacts with can be used to to benefit Santos"
Spurlock14,"Hell no! He’d sell it to the highest bidder.
He shouldn’t even be in our government."
kettlebell43276,He shouldn’t get health insurance let alone classified information
spaitken,"“Republicans should not get intelligence information”

FIFY"
IrresistibleCliche,Intelligence and George Santos in the same sentence.  I didn't think that was possible.
Galaxy_Ranger_Bob,"Actually.  This guy is the *perfect* person to give intelligence information to.  When he tries to sell it to foreign countries (which we know he will,) they'll not believe the information is anywhere near the truth because he only has the reputation of being a liar, about everything."
rypb,But he will.  And he’ll sell it to foreign adversaries.  And then justify it by saying simply “I haven’t done anything wrong.”
hajabalaba,"If anyone is a Russian asset, it’s this fucking guy."
Orgigami,"Well, duh…"
the-hottest-of-damns,"It doesn’t matter, he’ll lie to his handlers"
AltNationReality,"Well.... Since he cannot even verify who he is, I would say that he shouldn't be allowed anywhere near classified information.  A security clearance is a well vetted process.  No one even knows who this clown is, who he works for, or what foreign agency got him elected."
ElderFlour,He should not get a bloody loo key!!
Grimholt001,The should feed him some false info. When he inevitably tries to sell it for profit or uses it illegally take him down.
Ocean53,Republicans need to show even they can’t have such poor character and integrity in their ranks.
pner,"Even if he leaked government secrets, nobody would believe him. Now we know what a liar he is."
juanjung,The real question here is why George Santos is in the Congress and not in prison?
DABOSSROSS9,"Would you guys be ok with democrats making a deal with republicans to impeach him, but not run anyone against his replacement? We get this a hole out of congress and the number of representatives per party doesn’t change"
honkytonks,"Who is the lawyer on Reddit who will sue the government on taxpayers behalf to get this joker out of there? We will publicize and fund your work. Jezusfuckinchrist. He couldn’t still work at 7-11 with all the bullshit he put in his resume. 

This is goddam ridiculous. 

Let’s not let republicans low standards be the bar."
Automatic_Scholar686,Why not? Because he’s a con man? Wasn’t our last “president” the same thing?
SithLordSid, None of those Republican traitors should get intelligence information. Who knows who they are selling it to?
1-1111-1110-1111,We should just give him fake intelligence and pretend it’s real.
manymaniacs,Why the f isn't Garland charging him? Just gonna let it slide again?
crystalistwo,"Why would anyone believe him?  We could discover cold fusion and he'd have the docs, and the Chinese would be like, ""Yeah, right."""
things_U_choose_2_b,"They should feed him deliberate disinfo, then use that to arrest him for espionage if / when it leads to action from a hostile state."
ClobetasolRelief,How the fuck is he even allowed to enter the building
AshingiiAshuaa,"I'm not much for back-room deals, but you'd think McCarthy could phone Hochul and make a deal that if the house expelled Santos that the governor would appoint a GOP replacement."
Pompous_Monkey,"Question - Why does a person that lies get to keep his job?   

You all know the answer to this one."
Wrest216,The guy who said the rioters trying jan 6 in their own country of brazil should be armed by the US govt? I THINK NOT.
Rickjamesbutchapelle,"Whenever I think our political system working I find myself realizing that EVERYONE IN CONGRESS SHOULD BE COMING AT HIS NECK. 

If they really wanted our best interest they all could raise hell over this but they don’t. Both sides. Not one push."
OlderThanMyParents,And the GOP’s response will be “You can’t tell us what to do! He’s on the House Intelligence Committee!”
mhagin,He never should have gotten seated.
ServingTheMaster,"duly elected civilians are qualified for a security clearance by process of election. the primary role of a security clearance in this context is to ideally hold that civilian accountable for the unlawful release of that information. no such restriction exists for people without security clearances. unless you're trump, then you just do what you want and there's no consequences."
King_Mandu,The dude that lied about everything?  How was he not kicked out of any and all government jobs forever?  The US government is such a fucking joke.  Burn it all down.
kingkarl96,"No, he definitely shouldn’t. But he will."
whimsicalsteve,"Being a member of Congress shouldn’t immediately give them security clearance. Security clearances have very strict requirements so if they need that clearance to do their jobs and they don’t meet the standards than they shouldn’t have run in the first place. 

Since he’s already elected if he doesn’t meet the requirements allow him access to only unclassified data and if that means he can’t do much… shame."
Kjellvb1979,"George Santos should be in jail imho. 

The fact we don't have laws about lying about oneself while running for a political office that gives an individual such power and access to a 6 figure  tax payer funded salary without any repercussions is simply beyond me. How can it be fraud to impersonate or misrepresent oneself in a variety of ways in the eyes of the law, but essentially creating an all-encompassing false persona to get elected is not some sort of fraud? 

And I mean, if you're an outcast even in the scummy, unethical, immoral, hypocritical, sociopath in the form of a political party, that is the GOP, is inconceivable that this guy exist. 

Of course, that said, it also  makes sense to me. It just makes sense on some level given how broken our system of ""representation"" is."
Trying2Understand69,What this guy deserves is a prison sentence.
Sunnyfe,"And also…his makeup is awful. It’s oxidizing, too thick and matte. And too much powder in my novice experience."
penguished,I just don't get how you can run on a literally fake resume for office and not go to jail. It's one thing to make campaign promises. It's another thing to present verifiable false statements about your career.
FlightAble2654,"He should, because he has none of his own."
redbrick5,I'm sure the intel community gives them exactly what info they want them to have (and share)
Jas9191,"You can lose a security clearance for smoking marijuana. The fact it can be leveraged against you as a federal crime is seen as enough incentive for bribery that to DoD does not allow it. You can be denied/lose it for going through a nasty divorce, for having poor credit or for having too much business in foreign countries. This guy is a huge security risk"
Catspaw129,"Yeah, but...

Let's say he is trusted with intel.  Given his, um, proclivity for confabulating, if you were a hostile foreign power would you trust anything he said?"
GottaKeepGoGoGoing,What does it matter no one will believe him if he tells them.
Ilikedagss,His intelligence report should only be lies….
oldsurfsnapper,"I can’t actually see a problem,it’s not like he’s going to tell the truth,after all."
gc3,George Santos should get fake intelligence information.
WarriorRose-70,He will not get clearance for any type of sensitive information and he won’t be able to seat on any committee that deals with sensitive information.
,No one would believe him if he tried to leak it anyway…
Comfortable-Wrap-723,He is a thief and liar and should not be trusted with anything specially intelligence information
cilantro_so_good,"Neither should have Ivanka or the rest of the kids, but here we are."
xfactor6972,He shouldn’t be allowed to sever on any committee whatsoever!
baddfingerz1968,George Santos should be str*ng up by his balls like the rest of those lying trumphumping traitors that are destroying this once great country.
winternightsDL,"So far he's going to get sworn into his post and nothing will be done. So from what I tell you, the “fake it, till you make it” mentality really works in Congress to where you can set the laws and policies for the government. Awesome!!"
trent58,"Gay, Jewish, Latino, with family and acquaintances killed in the holocaust, 9-11, and the pulse mass shooting. What kind of idiots would even believe this, plus giving him access to national secrets?"
Delicious_Flower_966,An excellent conduit for regular misinformation.
Donnor,Neither should I
Plxburgh,No but there’s a lot of stuff that shouldn’t happen.
invisableilustionist,But trump needs those for his records and documents collection
Odd_Status_9326,George Santos has a lack of intelligence information.
AtomGalaxy,You mean George Santos the astronaut?
Fun-Cupcake4430,"Ive never met a MAGA person who changed their views.

This guy is here to stay, we should stop giving these 20 clowns attention."
jack2bip,"Does he have the needed security clearance(s)?  His lies should prevent those from happening. Then again, Trump happened."
Macrosophy,"Just as is ordinary criticism must submit to BACKGROUND CHECKS when applying for jobs, so must anyone “applying” for positions in the Judicial, Executive and Legislative branches of the United States Government."
PDT_FSU95,"He shouldn’t even be sitting in that chamber. What would happen if you lied on your resume and got the executive position? You’d be fired, as soon as they find out. Well…we found out. Why is he still even there?"
SBendShovelSlayerAHH,Why does this guy always look like he’s coming down from a line of coke?
Schoonerchic,"Considering he doesn't have any intelligence, no he shouldn't!"
mrcanard,"The same people that swore him in will keep him in.

Shouldn't be a place anywhere in U.S. politics for him, but here we are.

edit: changed Should to Shouldn't"
greendolphinfeet,"For that matter, neither should MTG or Gaetz."
Fawnet,"No, no, he should get tons of it! But almost all of it should be useless and wrong."
