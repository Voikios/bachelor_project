HiPeepIDKwhatsGoinOn,"its always reminded me of the one place in harry potter where dumbeldore or someone has to use a boat to get accross and drink some stuff, or in pirates of the caribbean when i recently watched it where there is the treasure chest in the middle of a cavern"
Ibetya,MEOW MROW MEOW MEOW MEOW MROW MRRROW MEOW
Ramrod_Otsito,This USED to be a Boss arena.. Don't know how far you are in the game but back in the day this cave had TWO large SPIDERS in it. They liked to come OUT through the falls water and kill you near the Iron and copper nodes there.. One save I actually foundation off that whole cave mouth. I hate those darn things.
UristImiknorris,The yellow power slug is the boss.
OddThomasC1,"Location is Western Dune Forest, Cave entrance under waterfall between the two lakes. There are not any hostile creatures within the cave. This is also one of the locations that has a boom box tape."
Ashley_Titor,They need to add a lizard dog spawn so when you enter you question if it's a normal dog or a hostile dog boss
Wevee,I always thought it looked similar to Gollum's cave.  I suppose most caves look pretty similar though.
Metroidman97,I remember this place because the DRG tape is in here.
Mellowturtlle,Ok. It doesn't look like a boss arena. Your welcome.
MouldySandwiches,This place does not look like a boss arena
AwakenMyPP25,I found a DRG casette in there. Rock and Stone?
CrypticKilljoy,"I mean, kinda, but not for a satisfactory boss fight. Could really see myself ripping this off for a D&D game. :)"

RGBBSD,"""boss bar appears"""
Cuttlefish_Crusaders,Dawg found the lake Gollum lives atðŸ’€
bongwaterbaneRYO,This looks so much like that Mario 64 level with the water monster that you could ride on.
jdubyahyp,I think the gas cave looks like one and it has like 5 slugs in it so it's more boss like.
D_is_for_Doomsayer,Sure. This is clearly a fairy pond
Skullz64,"Trust me, I know 5 other areas that look like boss arenas"
utkarsh_dev,Mewtwo about to show up
