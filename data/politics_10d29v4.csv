Agent7619,"I overheard a conversation yesterday where in a span of 15 seconds a person went from literally yelling at the TV (FOX news of course) about Biden being a traitor because of five documents to Trump was the President and can declassify anything just by saying so.

The cognitive dissonance is absolutely staggering."
djfudgebar,Who voluntarily gave up their documents when they discovered that they had them and who lied and fought with the GSA for two years before finally having to be raided by the FBI?
Shaper_pmp,"""I'm not really concerned about the classified documents so much as why Trump was treated differently to Biden""

Accidentally said the quiet part out loud there, sport.

And to answer it, you might want to check the question you were asked where the interviewer literally laid out the differences for you in terms of the sheer number, Trump lying about returning everything and Trump's refusal to comply with subpoenas."
TheHoundofUlster," “We don’t know exactly what Trump has vs. what Biden has”

Kinda the job, champ"
IrishJoe,"Oh, oh...I know this one: because Biden is a Democrat and Trump is a Republican. 

I watched an interview with this piece of shit and he said he didn't care about the classified documents, he was only concerned with the fact that Biden and Trump were being treated differently. Well, dumbass, Biden has cooperated fully with the authorities and Trump fucked around for a year and a half and found out. That's the fucking difference!"
sh0ch,"""why was Trump raided, but not Biden?""

Because Biden complied and didn't lie about it."
Alexdoh,'Because I am a stooge who will find no wrong doing but claim I have found 'both sides' at fault'.
foyeldagain,"The whole uproar from the right is funny because the best case scenario ends with ‘Ok, so what then should happen to trump?’"
Derrick_Mur,"He can explain it, but he won’t because “we’re looking to score cheap political points with our base that’s either unwilling or incapable of seeing the irony of trying to crucify Biden for something that pales in comparison to what Trump did” won’t go over well with the general public"
otter111a,"Washington told his dad that he chopped down the cherry tree and his honesty is hailed to this day.

Lincoln walked miles and miles to return a penny and we put him on the penny to remember his honesty.  

Biden could have just shredded these documents as he found them. But he self reported and the gop is going after him rather than trump. 

There are no redeeming qualities in the Republican Party. They are anti American in every regard."
JuuzoLenz,😂. Classic GOP
Ardenraym,"Political corruption.

Always has been.

Always will be."
GoatVSPig,"The likelihood that Donald's situation is much worse than Biden's is *why* the GOP is investigating.

For the record, investigate them both.  Let the facts fall here they may."
obsertaries,"For better or worse the justice department hired an independent counsel, so if and when they come up with a nothing burger what will the committee say? Accuse them of not being independent when it is literally their only job?"
canon12,"Both should be dealt with equally and all the facts/details revealed. Both should be penalized.  I don't recall Biden directing, rewarding and permitting a terrorist insurgency on the Government he swore to uphold. Biden should pay a huge fine and Benedict Adolf Trump should be in prison for the rest of his sorry, useless and loser life...in my opinion."
quixoticquail,Seems like an oversight
bbbanb,"“No one has been investigated more than Donald Trump” 
How about nobody has done as much to merit investigation as has Donald Trump….where is the investigation of Donald Trump about the 300 FBI confiscated documents he “assumes he had declassified” if Trumps confiscated documents are actually “declassified” then why would the FBI have a subpoena available to them to raid Mar-A-Lago? 
And, if Trump has actually been found to have declassified his 300+ “formerly classified” documents then where is the public exhibit of all of Trump’s 300+ Mar-A-Lago confiscated documents since, according to the Republican Party, we can now presume as declassified? Declassified documents are available to the public for viewing are they not? Also, why did Trump decide to declassify these specific 300 documents? 

Also- wtf is Comey talking about:  “funding from China funneled via a university to Biden” What does any of that have to do with the handling or mishandling of classified or declassified documents? Is that just some kind of red herring intended to take the pressure off of reason? 

One more thing: where can I look to see where the laws of our land say when and where and how a president or vice president has the power to declassify documents via the sheer will to do so? I’d like to know."
silentjay01,"He could but it woukd lay bare in his own words that he is nothing but a hypocritical partisan hack going after Biden simply because he is ""on the other team"".

admiraljohn,">GOP House Oversight Chair Can’t Explain Why He’s Investigating Biden Classified Docs But Not Trump’s

I can... Biden's a Democrat. I've said before in regards to things the GOP chooses to ignore ""If this was a Democrat you'd be apoplectic."" 

And here's the proof."
benjatado,"Republicans: 
Why would the DOJ treat these cases differently when one person ignored requests and subpoena for over a year but the other person fully cooperated??"
ringelrun,"But i mean... it doesn't even matter,  does it? According to Republicans, Biden (as the president) cannot even be CHARGED with crimes,  right? So who cares? They need to stfu, plain and simple."
Kaiisim,"Just a reminder that classification was never the issue. Donald Trump refused to return property of the federal government as required under law. Classified or not they are the property of the federal government.

They put the conversation on classification because its the only area you can even vaguely make an argument."
trundlinggrundle,But can't Biden just declassify them with his mind? Or is it only Trump who has that superpower?
Bods666,"TLDR. 
‘I’m a partisan hack with my head so far up Chumps ass the lump in his throat it my nose’"
elegant-quokka,"Investigating Biden is an attempt to smear Bidens public image to voters. Investigating trump only opens him up to being called a RINO among his constituents. 

IMO this is also part of the GOP attempting to distance themselves from trump while still retaining as many MAGA voters as possible"
biskitheadburl,Hypocrisy.
CreepyWhistle,"Could he be *gasp* weaponizing the government politically, the very thing they accuse Biden of doing? My gosh, I think it's called projection. They wouldn't do that so obviously, right?"
Shnazzytwo,"I really enjoy them wanting to go all in on the Biden classified documents when anything that they might do on this goes 10 times against Trump.

Remember, they claim that Trump was able to declassify his documents with nothing written down because he's the President. Biden is now the president, why was he not able to declassify all 20 of those pieces of paper the second he was in office?

BTW, Biden's current totals: 20 total documents classified, 1 document marked top secret. Currently in process of returning, searching to verify there are not more.

Trump's current total: 300+ documents, 100+ marked top secret. Trump officially denied having them until the FBI raided him."

DotAppropriate8152,Looks as untrustworthy as he sounds!
a-really-cool-potato,"Because he’s a traitor, duh."
Schiffy94,">In his answer, Comer gave away his partisan motivation. “We don’t know exactly what Trump has vs. what Biden has,” he said. “At the end of the day, my biggest concern isn’t the declassified documents, to be honest with you. My concern is how there’s such a discrepancy in how former President Trump was treated by raiding Mar-a-Lago, by getting the security cameras, by taking pictures of documents on the floor, by going through Melania’s closet, vs. Joe Biden. They’re like OK, your personal lawyers who don’t have security clearance, yes, they can go through.”

Holy shit, Jimmy. You're just talking like you're Trump's mouthpiece."
tracerhaha,One word: politics.
MoonBatsRule,"> At the end of the day, **my biggest concern isn’t the declassified documents**, to be honest with you.

They are screaming the quiet part out loud, and no one seems to care.

This is like saying ""to be honest, I don't care about what drugs people are taking, my main concern is locking up as many black people as possible on drug charges""."
cmgchamp2,"Trump purposely taking home and hiding top secret nuclear documents.

NCHouse,"I was asked since I was for Trump getting investigated, if I was fine with Biden getting investigated with a smug ass look on their face. Told em absolutely"
Alternative-Flan2869,"Well, that’s easy to explain - there is no credible, reasonable explanation. Period. And why is there no oversight on insurrectionist conspirators.  And no explanation why after 1/6 with insurrectionists still in congress, the capitol metal detectors were removed. And no investigation into why santos is seated and still in congress. The House is now an embarrassing dysfunctional bad joke."
TemporaryConfusius,"Republicans only lie, deceive, project, and cheat now. Republicans are pathetically hypocritical and embarrassingly poor at losing. Who knows what they will do next time their daddy-god-emperor loses."
SynsDad,Because they’re terrified of the Orange Goblin that’s why!
dadudemon,I''ll say this: at least the Democrats I know in real life are saying to throw the book at Biden if he's guilty. Unlike the conservatives I know who said it was just a witch hunt to go after Trump.
EminentBean,Painfully hypocritical and fraudulent

This is all everyone is asking for. Period. It should not be difficult."
brpajense,"It's because he doesn't want to say he's trying to protect Republicans and embarass Democrats.  It's not about understanding what happened to try and prevent it from happening again, but attacking people based on their part affiliations.

HalcyonEnder,Start a bill to investigate regardless of party. Both sides would agree as it would be mutually beneficial in case the other has docs in single instances.  Risk it for the biscuit.

Jo-Jo-66-,"Because the GOP are hypocrites. Do what I say, not what I do."
CatholicSquareDance,"Hypocrisy is not a meaningful accusation to the right. That others are bound—by rules, standards, logic, human decency, some sort of fundamental moral consistency, anything at all—and they are not, is their conception of *what power is*,  and why they seek it: so they can exercise power, without constraint, and you cannot. 

That's the whole point."
MoonlitHunter,Better get the committee investigating “weaponization” of federal agencies to look into it.
xseodz,"I just can't believe that they're running with this.

The house is completely broken. They're throwing stones from their glass house and it's disintegrated."
TheMostSamtastic,"He complains about the treatment of Trump versus that of Biden, the raid, the photos, the media craze, but fails to acknowledge that said discrepancy only exists because Biden, unlike Trump, immediately cooperated with investigators. Rather, Biden's tram turned in the documents BEFORE an investigation even commenced. Also it should be noted that Trump clearly intended to take documents which were not his to take, while what happened exactly with the documents found in Biden's possession is yet to be revealed."
jjameson2000,"At the end of the video he said he’s not even that concerned about classified documents, he just wants to know why they went through Melania’s closets. 

This guy is beyond stupid. How did he even get this position?"
KinkyBADom,"He says no one has been investigated more than Mr Trump. I think Hillary Clinton might have something to say about that. However, this ignores the crimes that occurred in Donald Trump’s orbit either by him or by his associates and confidants.  The level of hypocrisy that this guy entertains is astounding."
buzzedewok,He needs to be asked this each and every time he is even in public.
WrongSubreddit,"ooh i know this one, is it blatant partisanship?"
BrightSkies42,"I guess on the bright side, it's still too dangerous to admit they're going after political opponents so that they can establish a red faux-Christian, fascist autocracy."
Yitram,"I can.  Because this isn't a good faith exercise.  Yes, both cases should be investigated to see where the system failed.  But barring anything else, Biden's case appears to be a case of the documents being taken mistakenly.  Meanwhile, Trump literally had to have a search warrant levied against him to get documents back, that he claimed he had already returned or didn't have. One is worse than the other, but of course, Republicans only care about the one that can be weaponized against their enemies.

EDIT: Added everything after the third sentence."
MichiganDirt,"Am I understanding this correctly? -45 stopped publishing visitor logs, but Biden actually started doing it again? Lying lawyers and an fbi raid VS not lying and actually handing over everything they find without subpoenas?"

bgdg2,"Well, maybe Comer is hoping for a President Harris."
icevenom1412,I feel like Biden is baiting the GOP into investigating him for less than 20 classified documents so they would have to explain why they are defending Trump at least 60 classified stolen materials.
JJDude,"""It's because I'm a partisan sack of shit."""
ieatpotatochips,"Just out of curiosity since the GOP is asking for visitor logs to Bidens personal residence, is it normal for Joe Biden to keep logs of who shows up to his private home?

Rosaadriana,Because because…..Benghazi!
magicsonar,"Ensuring that these stories are treated as partisan attacks helps ensure that corruption can continue to thrive. When Republicans refuse to look at corruption inside their own party and make basic oversight a partisan issue, it benefits everyone that is engaged in corruption. It actually even helps those on the Democrat side get away with corruption also - because oversight, investigations and accountability come to be seen by both sides as unjustified partisan attacks. And paradoxically, the greater the divide and antagonism between the two sides, the more it benefits the really corrupt, who typically work both sides."

This dude has come out of seemingly no where and has been doing the rounds on every network since the midterms. To me, this means it's all an insincere act. He folds, and by folds I mean he just sits there and stammers or starts blathering on some other unrelated topic, each time an unsympathetic host calls him on the hypocrisy."
2_Fives,"What are the odds the House GOP move to vote for impeachment of Biden to get back for Trump?

Tarkorotsu,"In regards to who deserves serious legal punishment for the handling of state secrets, Donald Trump for the amount of documents in unsecured areas and the refusal to return them when asked is deserving. However, Joseph Biden’s incompetence in having documents since he was vice-president, even when they were in secured locations and responded quickly to  return them, is not acceptable. This is not only a bad look that can really hurt efforts to actually to bring Trump to heel but also shows the difference in how class determines leniency to breaking laws. If you have the money and authority, you can easily break laws and get slapped on the list for mishandling secret documents while if you are a junior officer and do that, your life is ruined. 

Both men should actually be brought down by their own incompetence. Honesty, I do not mind Joseph Biden being impeached (by both parties to set an example) for this; even when he is being compliant with the DOJ. Still I do think it is better for him to resign to allow Kamala Harris to take power for at least she does not have the same dirt that Biden does from this intense amount of political stupidity. Say what you will against the Republicans and their incompetence in governance, their media outlets are still efficient and will quickly be used to fuel the fires of the large amount of hatred their base has for Joseph Biden and spread it amongst those who lack the ability to think for themselves.

Joseph Biden is too old for politics and is now a greater liability for the Democrats and the country itself as our country needs strong leadership and competency at a time where we are starting to fall apart. A Desantis presidency could be worse than Trump’s and fresh blood from the Democrat Party will be needed to prevent him from gaining power in our idiotic two party system. So I rather throw Biden to the lions and have a chance for a President that stops another Republican Presidency. 

Those who may say this is not a big deal could argue well that this is blown out of portions. I retort though that you do not understand the Republican base. They will cut their enemy’s throat when they have the chance, regardless of the morality of the situation. Plus for years, Biden has been demonized and there is a framework of many attacks that can be executed against him from the political right. So I rather deprive them of anything to help them get back into executive power and sacrifice Biden for the greater good of the country before we let the minority of the country strangled our country to death out of our own stupidity."
farkinga,Biden is the president.
