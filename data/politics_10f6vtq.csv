JulesVelour,Is there anything about George Santos that *isn't* a lie?
s-multicellular,"And, in fact, the GOP are sending their best."
Rusalka-rusalka,"At this point, I think he needs to post his birth certificate."
Total_Customer_6627,"Holy shit this dude shouldn‚Äôt be in Congress. 

The people who elected him should feel ashamed, but knowing republicans, they‚Äôre probably proud."
,"""He would say, 'oh well, the Jews will give more if you're a Jew.' So that's the name he used for his GoFundMe."""
umaniaxublewitup,This dude is such the perfect representation of the current republican party
Tots2Hots,I didn't think the GOP would put someone worse than Margorie or Bobert into office but here we are.
musicmastermike,I love how everyone is just focusing on the negative about this guy. Yet nobody seems to care that he invented penicillin and helped broker peace between the north and south Korea.
WorkinOnMyDadBod,Everyday we find out this guy is more of a piece of shit than the day before.
SkankBiscuit,"This is the face of the Republican party, folks."
KeyserSoze_IsAlive,"I don't get why a PFC in the Army or a GS-6 has to have a background check, but people like Santos, MTG, Boebert, Harris, Biden, and Trump don't. That's one of the dumbest things in U.S. politics. Do you think Santos is the first grifter that got into office? Hell, the entire Republican Party seems to be comprised of low-level con artists, plants, and Russian assets."
Ok_Ninja_1602,"Well Nassau County wanted Jewish representation so they got someone that was Jew-ish and also filled the checkboxes for white, young, Hispanic, gay, wolf of wallstreet, volleyball champion and someone who was victimized by the attack on 9/11. That's who they wanted to represent them so that's who they got."
Champagne_of_piss,"At 1.2% Ashkenazi, i am more Jewish than him lol"
IAmTeemo,I memba' when Al Fraken had to resign because he took an inappropriate photo
,[deleted]
LoftyGoat,"Everyone keeps being surprised by Santos.

In 1968 the republican party made Spiro T. Agnew, already under indictment, vice president.  He was led out of the White House in handcuffs, as I recall.

Mind you, it isn't just republicans, but republicans seem to be engaged in a long-running experiment to see just how much the American people will tolerate.

They mostly stay under the radar, but this isn't exactly new.

Stay angry, and *don't forget*."
Phy44,"I didn't think it was possible to erode my trust in the government more, but the fact this guy is still running around congress has destroyed what little there was left."
DadinDenver,"It‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs a *total piece of shit* that maybe shouldn‚Äôt be in Congress, but he **does** sort of fit in with the majority of Republicans."
Ligmund_Freud,Someone explain to me why this guy isn't being prosecuted for fraud. Explain it to me like I'm 5.
so_what_do_now,Dude is a danger in congress. Not a single bone in his body is capable of telling the truth
cmit,"Kevin McC has said that Adam Schiff cannot serve ona  House committee ""because he lied to the American people"".

Go figure."
newgreyarea,This guy is an almost perfect example of modern Republicans. Almost. Just needs a pinch of white nationalist bloodlust and a secret affair with a barely legal boy and I‚Äôll have BINGO! üòÇ
I-Kant-Even,"This guy watched nine seasons of Suits, and told himself ‚ÄòI can do that.‚Äô"
Extra-Ad5925,Every day it gets a little worse. Tomorrow it will be ‚ÄúGeorge Santos stole candy from a group of babies at Central Park‚Äù
FortunateInsanity,"If anyone hasn‚Äôt figured it out yet: This is exactly how the GOP has operated ever since Citizens United was passed and Cambridge Analytica taught the entire political spectrum how to utilize metadata to laser focus their messaging to maximize intended impact.  The target audience is different, but the unethical and unapologetic manipulation of the masses is the same.  

Because of this, the bottom 99.9% have been incessantly corralled by the powerful into our political market segments based on personal behavior patterns and used against each other for the last two decades.  It‚Äôs literally a divide and conquer strategy.   Keep the least fortunate among us focused on hating ‚Äúothers‚Äù who they actually have a lot in common with.  That is the only way the very few can stay in power despite the many having so little."
Overall-Yam-2471,The GOP has such a deep bench when it comes to human turds
ebone23,"Oy vey, this ◊û÷∞◊ò◊ï÷º◊û◊ò÷∏◊ù"
rounder55,Santos or whoever he is used to be a a piece of shit. He's still a piece of shit but he used to be as well. Some people can't change
amaranthusrowan,"What kind of POS starts a GoFundMe for a veteran‚Äôs service dog and then steals the money, leaving the dog to die?  Karma needs to bite this guy in the ass."
kskcan,"He loves to lie to the people and this is what makes him an average politician, that's the thing that he is facing, he is used to of lying and he can't change that now."
jpk195,He‚Äôs Trump without daddy‚Äôs money. Seriously.
9381449361,It's so bad to see George Santos lying all the fucking time and I am damn sure that this is also a fucking lie and most of the guys are going to guess that right.
Ruyue45,"Republicans have a weird thing for pretending to be jewish while holding antisemitic views. Really weird, no matter how I think about it."
forrestpen,"On one hand, he should be removed from Congress immediately.

On the other hand, Republicans won't have a leg to stand on in any conversation about ethics and integrity for a generation or two. Santos and Trump forces every R around them to go on record defending them and I believe that will ultimately doom their party long term."
MeetingKey4598,"I'm going to need a 100 page research assessment on how any candidate could lose to this guy in the primary or general.

Like we can expose all of this, but how the god damn hell did he win? I know House districts can be funky and it doesn't matter how shit a candidate is, but this is something else."
heads36,What‚Äôs the over/under that those glasses do not have prescription lenses?
Mccheeeseburger,"Breaking news: George Santos is actually three raccoons in a trenchcoat. Their names are Bloopy, Tootsie, and Nibblets."
LesbianLoki,"Uhhh... Isn't this guy supposed to be receiving a security clearance?

I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure the lies in the resume is enough to disqualify regular people."
PrengaG,"Damn man, he lies too much and I think there are going to be more things that will be revealed by the people of this George and we all know the reality is coming."
SCGower,"You know what? I‚Äôm Jewish and I don‚Äôt appreciate that, George."
Shayrkahmamla,"I've been hearing bits and pieces about this person. The more and more I hear about the things he's done and said, the more reprehensible he becomes. Sorry for using less than pleasant words about him."
Custodian_Nelfe,"We have a lot of dumbass politicians in my country (France), but this one surpass all of them and by far."
Bringmetolife91,"I would have pushed for his resignation after it came out he stole $3000 from the GoFundMe for the veteran's service dog. So it could get cancer surgery. He ended up having to euthanize his dog. What an asshole.
 Edit : Veteran's name is Richard Osthoff."
Lumpy-Dingo-947,Not the opinion on Jews and money I‚Äôd expect coming from a republican fraudster.
gaerat_of_trivia,obviously he wasnt taking into account loss of revenue due to antisemitism
Superjam83,How did all this not come out BEFORE the election?
Lost_Cardiologist307,This is what our politicians have turned into‚Ä¶.opportunistic charlatans
and_a_side_of_fries,"George Santos* - *nervous about the shit we have Yet to find out* 


*if that‚Äôs his real name"
Kantsas,I've seen minimum wage jobs with higher standards than the US CONgress.
LeftFieldBlue,"I know that his shit is absolutely egregious and would not be tolerated in Democratic run house, but let's not let this guy's bullshit overshadow the real dumpster fires that McCarthy's house are set to light.. they're walking around with dried flaming turds on hay hooks right now.. ready to start tossing em."
siparthegreat,When you add up all the different percentages on this guys 23 and me and it adds up to 146%
appendixgallop,"Dear Democratic Americans;

As Sen. Warren said, ""If you don't have a seat at the table, you're probably on the menu.""

Republicans are simply far more aggressive, devious, and determined about winning power.

Historians will look at the last two decades and wonder why nobody did anything about it."
sadwer,"This guy's opponent must've been the most ineffectual candidate ever. I mean, my God, this is a seat in Congress and you couldn't hire a PI to investigate this guy?"
RoamingTofu666,This guy is laughably awful. It‚Äôs a shame he isn‚Äôt a fictional character because this man has so much literary potential. An Elmer Gantry type of character but on coke and 21st century politics rather than booze and 20th century religion.
tyriancomyn,Republicanism Unmasked: The ~~Anthony Devolder~~ George Santos Story
lesChaps,I am already tired of him. Can we jump to the consequences of his actions now?
FluphyBunny,Sorry America but you need to be better than this.  The guy is scum through and through.
Irrelaphant,"Tomorrows headline: 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt use a Jewish name. I used a Jew-ish name. Big difference‚Äù

- George Santos"
89LeBaron,"This type of behavior coming from a Republican. absolute shocker. 

If I were a conservative, I would be trying to tear down that entire institution. Not voting for it. 

Absolute fucking disgrace."
Screambloodyleprosy,"Life at this point is just people, companies, and corporations trying to grift everyone and each other."
Some-Zucchini6944,"Don't get me wrong I know there has always been dis-function in government but, it just seems like the last 10-15 years have been building up to this point of just pure nonsense and I'm afraid to see what the next level is. This guy is SNL material at this point.

Edit for spelling"

sacha10356,WHY is he still in office????! Kevin McCarthy won‚Äôt move to remove him which tells u what he‚Äôs about. This person lied to voters and needs to be removed immediately.
ibitncash,"I would like to say that these liar politicians are what we need to get rid of, we need to focus on something better than this if we can get that shit real good right now lol."
godnrop,Waiting for SNL to bring back Jon Lovitzs ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs the ticket ‚Äú lying guy
Kid_Serious,"The way things are going, Santos will be the GOP presidential front-runner by the end of the month. He's racking up points with the voters with every one of these stories."
timmothy1984,"Why the fuck he has to lie like that? It's just fucking funny and annoying to me man, why the fuck he loves to do random shits like this with name changes and all."
ennuinerdog,It was just his jew-wish.

Blastmaster29,Republicans are so easy to grift. It‚Äôs hilarious he actually got elected
Earptastic,Was he right-ish?
Tony_Stark_0,Am I the only one who finds it very telling that the Republican party *as a whole* isn't falling all over themselves trying to eject this piece of human garbage from public office?
BrownEggs93,This guy is looking like the perfect GOP candidate every day!
CartographerOk7579,Honestly Santos is only a little bit shittier than the rest of the gop.
zestzebra,Very Trumpish of him.
Shavethatmonkey,"Republican hi-jinks! 

Santos is peak republican.  Everything is lies and hate and grift.  He's going to run the GOP within a year."
TotallyNottaDilf,"It‚Äôs like if Donald Trump was Sith, Lord Palpatine of Cons. And this guy wants to Darth Vader but he‚Äôs Jar Jar Binks"
benadrylpill,The more I read about this guy the more it sounds like he's perfect for the GOP.
FantasyGam3r,Everything these guys‚Äô do seem like bad 4chan ideas come to life
beau_hemian,"Wow. Conman through and through. Any one of us would be fired on the spot, but he‚Äôs allowed to stay in office?!

WHY??????????

Regardless of party, how can you trust someone to rep their people while they‚Äôre a proven con? This should not be an acceptable track record for public office."
bento8621,What the fuck is wrong with this guy
llamazaresj,Republicans like him. He is one of them. A racist and a con man.
JarJarJarMartin,Republicans are so easy to con. I could make a fortune grifting them if I didn‚Äôt have a conscience.
Bat-Honest,Are we cheap or generous? I'm having trouble keeping up with the Right's use of antisemitic tropes these days
Troml,Classic GOP grifter
AgreeableCod,Pretty funny
Wiliva0202,This putz is going to drag the GOP down to depths that it's going to take years to repair the party.
Ryanlynn2004,I understand when people bend the truth a little to get ahead.  I will never understand when people just blatantly lie.
jbowguss,I‚Äôm not sure why this story is stunning to anyone. He‚Äôs just a personification of the GOP as a whole. Imagine if this was a democratic story. Every single red voter would be hospitalized for the collective aneurysms
moodyblue8222,This guy is such scum! Perfect face for the new Republican Party!0
eveningsand,Can we lock this guy up with Pharma Bro? Please?
hypernova13,How many protests are going to be needed to get this guy out of office?
---Blix---,"No matter what you think of George Santos, you can't deny that's he's a Republican."
julbull73,Well is it progress if you take the stereotype as it was normally presented of Jews being greedy/miserly and instead have gone to Jews being generous/easily conned?
j-merc23,Why did none of George's opponents investigate his background?
suffertunity,He really needs to bone up on his stereotypes
TheSecretAgenda,The next Speaker of the House.
yulDD,GOP poster boy
flufnstuf69,Literally how does he still have a job? Tired of the American politic machine cogs being unfireable.
johnnyytrash,This guy is a literal piece of shit
CoolAppz,DAs apparently don't have the balls.
Highplowp,"He‚Äôs Jew‚Äùish‚Äù, not Jewish. It‚Äôs a typo."
y2kcockroach,"This to me is as fascinating as it is disgusting. Santos ran under a GOP banner that he obviously thought places ""zero"" emphasis on adherence to the truth, and he may have been right since few in the GOP seem interested in calling him out on any of it.

For the GOP it is Party, Power and Prayer - in that order. ""Truth"" has no place in it. The GOP's supporters/voters seem to largely agree.

In a democracy people tend to get the politicians that they deserve, and the people that voted for Santos truly got the politician that they deserve."
tbmrustic,He very well could be an uncircumcised Jew since there is no end to this prick !
greenielove,Has anyone checked on his citizenship yet?
kosarai,"Man, if I was a foreign spy I‚Äôd just run for congress as a Republican. Seems pretty easy to get in and stay."
Stealthy_Snow_Elf,Shout out to moderates/centrists in New York for voting for this guy. Truly outdone yourself. Turned a blue district red for a nazi pretending to be a jew to grift harder.
lgodsey,"Santos may not be a good person, but he sure is a good Republican."
smoq_nyc,"In next episode: "" George Santos is actually two people in a trench coat"""
Junior-Let567,This guy makes Trump look like an amateur liar
Howitworks4me,If this guy isn‚Äôt just a caricature I don‚Äôt know who or what is!
Abrushing,And this guy was given multiple committee assignments instead of being run out of Congress
GaulzeGaul,r/conservative is against this dude. Credit where credit is due!
chesland2d,"It would be better to not have these person near our fucking lives but sadly they are fucking politicians that we are going to see on a fucking daily basis man, sad."
