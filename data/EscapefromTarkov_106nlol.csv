KentuckyBrunch,"And just remember, most cheaters aren’t even blatant. Imagine if we knew how often there’s a radar/esp/wallhacks cheater in raid."
Business_Report7463,Got killed by Aladdin on shorline last night
Raikohhh,"""Cheating is in the best state it's ever gonna be"" - Nikita last year...

He wasn't wrong that's for sure"
AbundantIndifference,"""We know. Thanks for buying EoD though"""
pogasnt,Could post 2 clips myself from shoreline today (EU north) but what’s the point everyone knows it
glassbong_,"Rampant cheaters with noclip + new map (which is the most hype map in the game) runs like trash + worst FPS audio I've ever heard + yucky movement and recoil mechanics.

Everything is fine."
Shooter503,"I really hope they are just taking a day or two off for Christmas in Russia and they will sort shit out in the coming days, but I know that's not true and I'm just coping."
murrkpls,BSG is skillfully murdering their own game so they can drop it and focus on a new project like they've been wanting to do for years. Big brain plays.
tkwool,"met an alladin on streets just floating down the road, tried to shoot him (wasn't aware that was a hack at the time, thought it was an animation bug) and subsequently died instantly after, very fun wipe so far :))))"
Rootorii,"Don't worry guys, in 2 or 3 months BSG will post a tweet announcing ""Big banwave today - X amount of the cheaters have been banned"" we just need to wait for a little bit. Be patient my friend!"
Scarity,"[first 8!! posts are about cheaters](https://imgur.com/a/96rHHS6)

hahahahahaha what a game, why do people even still try"
FullMentalJackass,I've been considering getting this game recently. Seeing this post on r/all made me realize that I need to stay away. Thanks.
Solaratov,"The ""I've only seen 1 cheat in 5,000 hours"" and ""every game has cheaters stop talking about it!"" clowns are screamshitting their diapers right now."
V4ALIANT,we should make it our mission to flood the front page with videos of cheaters in action. Record every interaction and post
Rezhyn,I'm amazed people even record it anymore. I die to it and go 'theres todays blatant cheater' and just go into next raid. It's just normal now. Not excited to do test drive.
marniconuke,"I remember when cheaters were banned live on streams, they actually cared enough."
InsaneVizir,Yep. Shoreline is infested. Go to resort in the first 20mins you r instadead
NotSLG,"To me it’s just crazy the stuff they can get away with. Flying, god mode, the info they can see, killing people by looking at them."
theonlyjcali,That's why their last game failed
CatOfTarkov,"Never forget that at a 2014 conference for game developers in Moscow Nikita literally said:  
  
“Cheating is a tricky subject. Grief drives sales, and one of the avenues of grief is cheaters.”"
Suicidalskies,"Imagine if people would stop sucking off a certain streamer and realize his blatantly obvious looks at the second monitor to see where people are, Always knows where people are even if they're not making any sound, shoots people they can't even see and more. 

The ttv butt lickers always say ""they're reading chat""... who glances at chat for a split second during a gun fight... NO ONE!  

They already got banned a couple of times that I know of due to cheat detection detecting software and booting them.. but bsg promptly fixes it because they generate revenue for tarkov.

It's really pathetic how gaming is nowadays, the little ttv fanboys can't get their faces out of the streamers butt long enough to see the forest for the trees, this is not only in tarkov but other games as well. I never understood why people will defend the ttv, but if literally anyone else did those same things they'd call hacks in a split second.. and to top it off, they literally throw money at the screen to appease their ttv God that doesn't give 2 craps about them."
FactHot5239,I don't want to see any shitters post about how they haven't encountered a single one in their 1000 hours of gameplay ever again.
ConradIronmonger,"Another ""Cheater Megathread"" inbound. Yeah mods, just conseal the problem, ez solution!"
Exact-Bonus-4506,Cheaters is only one tenth of all problems with this game. Although I agree it's the most rage indcing one. I'd take bad performance over cheaters any day
KaiDynasty,"It's disgusting how they are handling things so bad.  

It's the first wipe i play from start, is this the same every wipe?"
kenpls,"Be careful guy, you are violating ""Rule 7"" of this subreddit, my post just got removed because I posted the same thing and I didn't have ""video evidence"" lmao"
Charliemurphy2992,Cheater posts are generally the only accepted format on this reddit so I'm not surprised.
Salami__Tsunami,"Most of my suspicious encounters happen as a scav. I’ll wander around for 20 minutes without incident, but then as soon as I pick up a good piece of loot, I’ll get domed by a player scav out of nowhere."
USArmy68Whiskey,"News flash, they don't care."
Decent7,"About two nights ago (NA East, Northeast, and Central servers), my buddy and I were running customs trying to finally get pharmacist done but we had spawned at old gas. Knowing the most likely near by spawns would be some ways over a fence line either direction, we sprinted immediately under the train bridge into the building next to power building. We hid in a corner on the furthest right side of that building near the weapon box being extremely quiet and sneaky the whole way (as we had died about 6 times in a row prior to that run) and laid still for about 3-4 minutes. No Scavs had spawned in the giant empty lot in front of the building, yet all of a sudden, we both start getting the bullet whiz/stress resist effect blur on our screens as bullet noises came by our heads, from the direction of the fence ramp jump. Remembering this was a windowless wall to our building, we assumed at first that it was an audio glitch (similar to keys on shoreline a while back). However, two pair of footsteps came thumping up to that wall of the building, and began pacing and ads’ing around both of that side’s corners of the building strafing us for about 6 minutes straight. I was hiding in a perfect spot to ambush if they came through the front door, and I was already ads’d without any tactical device on, and one of them immediately bunnyhopped across the front as if it was known I could take an immediate headshot with my pp19 if it were peeked. They continued to strafe us as we anxiously waited for about another 4-5 minutes before they ran back and started being sneaky coming through the back door that faces old gas. Me and my mate then sprinted as fast and as far as we could to the opposite end of the map behind mil checkpoint, and it was definitely the sketchiest situation we had ever lived through in raid. I kept trying to talk myself out of the “cheater thoughts”, however I know for a fact that we made not a single gun click, exhale, glass crunch foot swivel or anything the entire time they were in earshot. Yet they moved in the same way that we would if we heard someone in the room and were preparing to push an offense."
viKKyo,And mods should remember that this isn’t the community tired of merely seeing these posts - I.e. don’t remove these posts.
East_Current6004,"The game is unplayable, especially in the new map, with all these cheaters and optimization issues. Do they not play the game to realize this? I’m just gonna stop playing for now, which sucks because I spent over $100 supporting this nightmare"
doomedtobeme,"Its actually insane, feel like I cant visit any high tier loot areas anymore.

Lighthouse - hackers

Labs - hackers

Shoreline - hackers

Reserve bunkers - cracked AI or hackers.

&#x200B;

So sick of people parroting ''well it was possibly just d-sync''...no mother fucker he jumped over a fence and headshot me, d-sync doesn't explain everything"
WWDubz,Guys! Please give them time! They have only had 7 years to literally fix anything!
N0sta1g1a,"There is a reason raids seem to be a lot better just after wipe for a couple of days and that is because the cheats havent come up yet. Gaming as a whole has gone to shit because cheating has become the norm. Unfortunately all these devs sit on their hands and hope that quick fixes like battleye help, they dont.

PubG did nothing until they lost over 90% of their player base and Tarkov is heading in the same direction.

EDIT: I play in OCE and I can tell you if the EU and NA are complaining its tenfold here in OCE. ESP is rampant.  


EDIT2: I also blame counter strike for the cheating pandemic, because ""we have vac that is enough"". They gave up before it even got bad."
SeparateAddress9070,"If this community cared about cheating then we would force the mods to pin the thread until we get a response. Instead the mods, who pretend to care about this community, will do nothing."
DaHedgehog27,"If BSG Don't announce a ban wave or at least some acknowledgement, the 2nd twitch drops stop so does the game."
Twig,"A massive ban wave will come, everyone will celebrate, BSG will have a sale, the cheaters go buy another copy. Rinse and repeat."
PaulVonHindenburg,"Well, seems like they just don't delete the posts like usual."
ShadowRam,"I'd be 100% fine with a Offline mode where we can keep the stuff and just play 100% PvE

I absolutely love PvP, but at this point, the game and cheaters is so bad, I'd rather salvage whats' left of this game as a offline experience."
mrwilson253,"TBH, I subscribe to the idea that BSG is fully aware of the gaps in their security and leaves them so they can sell more accounts to cheaters."
,[deleted]
No-Chocolate5642,"Russians don't care, just drink vodka and eat tushonk with money of stupid Americans."
mped14,I was told that is was just a skill issue and there are no cheaters in tarkov. ....
Adius_Omega,"There has got to be a solution to these sorts of problems. 

It must be an incredibly difficult problem to solve or maybe there is an ulterior motive to NOT fixing these issues because of a potential revenue stream drying up.

Pure speculation but until then I opt out of playing competitive PC games."
briinexd,it's really precious that anyone here is ignorant enough to think that BSG gives a flying fuck about people whining on this subreddit after shelling out $100 on their trash product.
qleptt,I don’t even know how to tell if i just get killed by a very good player or a cheater and im scared
Guinan_Domination,"I died a bunch to cheaters this weekend, bunch of pussies."
Rodic87,"Having seen pubg streamers blatently use esp, I can only imagine how difficult it would be to realize how many times that happens to you.

Anyone trying even a little could hide ESP hacking so easily that combined with the wonkyness of tarkov it'd be nearly undetectable to other players.

I've gotten to where I try to not even think about ESP hacking as a danger."
Trick_College2491,On shoreline I just randomly died by a single headshot didn’t even hear the shot after death it happened twice in a row and then I realized it might be a cheater.
aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,"Don't worry. They'll all be removed and megathread will appear soon enough.

You know because we don't need to see so many duplicate cases of cheaters."
Cain-x,"Exactly like real life.

People know they are getting fuck over and over, and still somehow have some sort of stockholm syndrome that makes them accept even the worst decision.

Seriously they want cheaters in their game they make more money with them through rebuy, so they won't do anything against that would seriously impact this system, everyone should know this by now. It's not the first year we've seen the evolution and it's getting even worst these days.

One thing to do, stop playing and stop accepting bullshits from devs like this by pointing it over and over until everyone awake for good, maybe things will changed.

Until then they have no reason to change anything."
PowerSkeleton,"There are so many replies here about oh the mods will just megathread the cheater posts and delete them soon after. 

Why don't we all post these clips collectively somewhere beyond the reach of reddit? Seems like there are plenty of tarkov players looking to keep up to date accurate reports/ clips of the cheating going on in hopes of bsg doing something to actually address it. However unlikely that may seem right now. 

Just last week I got head eyes'd in top floor crack house from ~599 meters. I was inside. And I have it recorded. I don't even think I was carrying anything of real value.."
_FreeXP,Pretty sure reddit is plastered with people just complaining about every single thing possible
crumbsnatchr1,Cod boys
OathGamingTV,"You are never going to be able to remove cheating or hacking as a whole. However, they need to put something in place to at least show us people are being banned or restricted."
Player2035,I have literally watched hours last wipe of discord streams of people logging into Tarkov with the cheats enabled just to demonstrate how many OTHER cheaters were in every raid and not to use them for any other purpose. As with these interfaces enabled they can see the info of all the other players in lobby and whether they too are cheating. I believe every lobby had at least one cheater in it that I saw.
lookitsandrew,"Yeah I’m just playing other games until it’s fixed.

Start citizen is pretty interesting so far..

Other good fps:
Squad
Arma 3"
Psychological-Arm-22,"LOL imagine a world of utopia -  where anyone at BSG visits a tarkov forum or whatever the fuck.. and actually cares.

--  I think 99.9% of devs who *play* the game are cheaters themselves.

- With all of what's going on up there in the north (clears throat):  RMT from Cheating Mfs who get banned and buy new acc ...  is the best economic bliss BSG could ask for these days. 


-

This game has nothing but aesthetics and even the aesthetics can't plaster this spaghetti code mess with god damn unity engine that will NEVER improve because THIS IS ALL THERE IT IS CAPABLE OF.


I had to vent. I really wish I didn't invest so much time in this game."
natsak491,"Just want to say I quit 3 days in because of the cheater issue. This on top of ungodly que times that you must sit through to play just killed it for me.

Why can’t we lock in a Loadout and then manage inventory, hideout, flea market while in que?

Why are there so many hackers, more each wipe?

Why does it take an eternity to get into a match?

I personally just don’t have the patience for the game in its current state, and it’s wild how much time you waste between raids"
Baltic_Gunner,"But they'll make an effort to put a pig carrying a Lithuanian flag on a wall in Streets, and writing ""Rossiya Ura!"" Next to it. Fuck them all and fuck their game. Living on borrowed time."
Centurion-of-Dank,Single Player Tarkov. Best way to play.
DickeTitten69,"I mean what’s the end goal though? 

If you: (informal you)

1.	post about cheaters
2.	still play the game
3.	think BSG will change their architecture

Then you are only trolling yourself. 

Posts will do nothing. Telling Nikita will do nothing. Spamming warnings in a popular twitch steamer chat will do nothing. Reporting will do nothing.

The only solution IMO is to wait for a competent dev to release something that can scratch some of the itches Tarkov does. Edit: it’s up to you if you want to waste your time with this game or not I personally won’t do it as there are many other opportunities for satisfying experiences"
podraosabenada,"I'm on the SA server, at least here we haven't found many cheaters so far. Maybe the hacks are not so affordable due to the very high price for us from poor countries. If you don't mind playing with a little lag, join us."
Rafq,"Funny how beginning of wipe was pure Blbss and now gaming chairs are on a rampage. 

Once somebody said that the cheater developers need to crack the tarkov binary executable after each update, so the cheats know where to hook in (?) I don't know how much truthful it is but it seems that in the first days of wipe the lobbies have been pretty chill.

Is this really something or just subjective?"
Madzai,"The issue is very serious, but i'm not seeing BSG doing anything before next week. I was week-long Holiday in Russia. so they weren't working, most likely."
Grandmastermuffin666,I literally asked someone for help with a quest from the discord server and he was a hacker
NecessaryPresence338,Another reason they should add killcam
Anarcotik,"And there's still people ""I hAvE 40000k hOuRs I hAvE nEvEr SeEn A cHeAtEr"""
MrDankyStanky,"I ran into a hacker on Streets. Looked out a window and saw a guy just floating around. Lit him up but he didn't die, after exchanging curse words he made it clear he was only in raid to find and kill other hackers. Good hacker man."
Chief_Amiesh,"i noticed last night there was post after post about cheating and the game’s state being garbage trash in general.
i made a similar post about 2 days prior, and was met with “stop playing then” and a bunch of comments on par with “it’s the best game it’s ever been and i’m having fun.” essentially i was told to go fuck myself. only 3 people acknowledged the fact that the games audio is game breaking… 
and then i log into reddit to see what’s up on EFT and i see this slurry of posts and i see everyone start circle jerking each other.
idk what gives but half of the people on this subreddit are internet edgelords who thing their word is law. that’s the half that constantly defends the game after 7 wipes having the same game-fucking problems, and that’s the same people that keep cheering nakita and the devs on to just do nothing to fix their game.
we all paid money, we all want tarkov to be good, we all want to be good at tarkov, but some people can’t just look at a problem and hold people accountable, they have to be the person who goes against the grain.
i’m going to start calling ppl out on their bullshit when they start defending the game, cus anyone with eyes, ears, a brain and some common sense can conclude that tarkov is officially BROKEN this patch."
REPOST_STRANGLER_V2,"I've got over 4000 hours in Tarkov, cheaters are everywhere currently."
Snaz5,"People still play, people still buy the upgrades. BSG don’t care. BSG would kick puppies if they knew it would get people to buy more copies."
pacmarn88,BSG sell the hacks..
SlaveDeMorto,"Also a reminder that a huge number of users on this reddit will still defend Tarkov claiming that there are no cheaters.

\- Video with an obvious raging cheater

A) Where is the rest of the raid? Why does the video start here?

B) Actually it's desync

C) Omg its a known spot I always shoot through walls in here as well and kill Timmies sitting there.

D) You are just bad because a good player would have done \[x\] differently

E) Woah, such a rare sight to see a cheater on a video, I played for 938409283402348 raids and haven't seen a single cheater.

F) You probably have done \[x\] thats why they are shooting at you like this.

G) The guy who approached you is calling out your nickname on VOIP is because you actually ran at him shouting your name like Leroy Jenkins and cut this part of the video.

\- Post about cheater situation, someone complaining

A) The reason why this happened is because you are a beginner, after you play 5000 hours you'll realize how wrong you are.

B) Actually it's desync

C) How can we trust you without a video?

D) Most people who complain about cheaters are below level 10

E) This reddit is full of crybabies who don't even play this game, so don't trust what the nonames are saying I'm playing this game just fine.

F) I've been playing for 4000 hours since breakfast and I never seen a single blatant cheater before.

G) People normally mistake cheaters for a good player

H) The guy you are describing was using his map/ammo/gear knowledge, not cheats.

I) Actually what you said is bull because nobody would do that.

J) People complain about cheaters using radar and wallhack and so on, but I never met a cheater in my life, maybe a slightly sus player, but it was a skill issue on my side.

K) Every game has cheaters, stop making a scene."
buckets-_-,from: dude who never heard of selection bias
GeT_EmBaRRaSSeD,"Only way to stop cheaters is to sue providers and or get kernal level anti cheat. 

Even if cheaters get banned in a week, you gotta imagine how many raids you can ruin in a week or even a day."
Blacklist3d,They're advertisements.  There was minimal posts throughout the week.  All of a sudden it's flooded with cheater posts.   They're taking their chance at advertising right now.  There's no shot everyone just ran into a cheater at the same time and posted at the same time.
Actual_Candidate5456,"i die raid so come to complain here

go back to play

i only play one game (:"
FAfoxtrot115,"I had a friend who admitted he only disconnected players who he knew were cheating by watching there movement and where they were watching after he knew the lobby was clear he would purposely steer clear of areas with players to let them enjoy the game and never killed another player who didnt deserve to be killed by a cheater hes stopped playing a while back but hes kept his word to never disconnect someone who was playing by the rules

Edit 1: I never said he was in the right but I felt like I should have atleast said on what he was doing hes a good guy at heart and hes been pretty honest with his recordings hes shown me"

lord_dude,BSG: 🤷
paraquartz_32,"At this point, I hope there’s an equal competitor sometime in the future that doesn’t suck like some clone right now ( looking at you, DMZ and Hazard Zone ), so BSG can get working on optimizing and fixing the damn game.

Taking about competitor, I would love to play a Tarkov clone set in the US. Seeing how Streets of Tarkov plays, a post-war / apocalypse New York would be my wet dream. Maybe similar to The Division but the whole map turns into Dark Zone with loot system like Tarkov ( instead of the colored beam system ). Gun play / mechanics from Insurgency Sandstorm / Arma; Atmosphere of S.T.A.L.K.E.R; all of that and I’m sold."
Some_Marionberry2152,I can’t even get into a match sooo y’all are ahead of me lol

DucksMatter,"Welp. I mean.. if BSG isn’t going to do anything about it. I don’t see the harm in others using things like ESP or Radar to do their best to avoid those cheaters.

BSG clearly doesn’t care. So eventually it’ll be a “can’t beat them, join them” type scenario. Or it’ll just get so bad that the playerbase will drop off and it’ll be like the cycle, where only cheaters really play the game now.

I think the reason people are seeing cheaters so much now is because of the server changes. We can’t pick med-low population anymore. Every server is “high population” so now people are stuck with them more and more because they can’t play their dead / empty raids."

Magnus5018,"Yesterday my friend killed af guy and ran into a Bush going prone, the other enemy walked around him for 8-10 min at a longer distance (my friend is not that good) my friend didnt move at all, and out of no where he shot him while he was hiding prone in giant bushes, his name was bigmommymilkers or something, with standard edition, i have 1500 hours and tought that was really weird, i never say report but there i did"
SAKilo1,They don’t come here
Intelligent_Yam_7852,just ran into a cheater that was helping another person get kills so yea can in fact confirm cheating is getting out if it not fixed its eventually its gonna kill the game
Swako_ITA,"Must heavily depend on servers, playing central eu server I maybe encountered a couple of possible cheaters this wipe"
Neven2468,Am I crazy or I see when a player is near me. Everytime a PMC runs in front of me or close by on my SCAV runs I see a thin white line (sometimes full or cutted out). It never shows only until there is a player near. I think that cheaters found out some wireframe abuse. Now people will say that I'm saying nonsense but it always shows up (situation stated).
hiddenintheleavess,easily the most cheaters I've encountered early wipe. I'm about to start reducing my server count since the wipe hype is slowly dying.
DucksMatter,"Don’t sweat it, the mods will have them removed in no time and create a megathread to hide all evidence because there are no cheaters in Tarkov. Just people who suck."
CLeANeR49,"Everything deleted no evidence here…
There is no war in basing… you get it"
HereFortheLulls,"Encountering cheaters sucks, it’s true. And it is probably getting worse!

Which is why you should log off and just stop posting about it. Go play something else for a bit and come back. Jesus Christ."
PrinceOfRye,The god mode hack is the one that blows my mind… it’s so frustrating to have zero chance.. at least when they have aims I might get lucky..
MatrixBunny,I feel like RADAR/WALLHACKS happen a lot more than I'd like to think is happening. The fact that BSG **never** speak about cheaters etc. just encourages people to do so more easily and frequently.
CatOfTarkov,This is going for ages. I stopped playing two years ago because of cheating and I know BSG cannot do anything because the game's entire code should be reworked to prevent cheating and it will not. I don't even know why I'm still interested in this game :(
tylert69,Modern day gaming.
Megatroon90,Could someone actually give a couple of things they actually can do to combat the cheaters?
ohboymykneeshurt,Me and my son got killed by a lone player in dorms. He literally killed us before he even turned the corner and he certainly had no idea of my position. So obviously a cheater.
