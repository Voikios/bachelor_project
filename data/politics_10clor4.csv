Reverse_Drawfour_Uno,"Is hiring an impersonator of McCarthy’s Chief of Staff to call people and bilk them out of donations, *not* “breaking campaign, finance laws?”"
M00n,"I found this showing a history of people removed from the House OR censured OR reprimanded..


https://history.house.gov/Institution/Discipline/Expulsion-Censure-Reprimand/#expel

Most were just censured or reprimanded.

(Search for 'campaign' to see possible matches)"
bildo72,"Investigated by the house ethics committee you say?

""We have looked into the matter involving ourselves and found nothing illegal was committed."""
well_uh_yeah,I will certainly not believe this until I see it happen.
westwardhi,“George Santos couldn’t have broken any laws” said Santos to reporters today “Because….” Santos said as he removed the mask from his face “I’m old man O’cleary from the Sawmill!” O’cleary then attempted to dramatically vanish in a cloud of smoke but accidentally set himself on fire. He is in jail awaiting trial.
DEdwardPossum,"If any of us apply for a job they want birth certificates, diplomas, GEDs, transcripts, background checks, the works. 

But being in congress does not need any of that?"

Nanojack,">""It's not up to me or any other member of Congress to determine whether he can be kicked out for lying.""

It's too bad they didn't get around to reading the Constitution on the first day like they said they would. If they had, he would have heard this part fairly early, in Article 1, Section 5

>Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member."
D0B3tt3r,">	House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said he will leave Santos' fate to the Ethics Committee and voters

But they just gutted the Ethics committee, which Georgie said was “fantastic”. Way to take the easy one out"
malkuth74,T-Minus 1 week before the republicans start saying he is a democratic plant to destabilize Republican districts in his area.
evonebo,"Right….. didn’t Trump break a bunch of campaign finance laws….. did he ever get removed. 

These guys are all talk."
thefoodiedentist,Maybe Mccarthy got pissed Santos had a dude impersonate his chief of staff to steal his donor money.
Secsidar,He’s also a wanted criminal. He’s wanted in Brazil for failure to appear in court for check fraud.
doucheydp,The sad thing is that no matter what happens to him he'll take credit for writing a book about it all and sell it for more money than most of us will ever have.
Motor_Somewhere7565,"The fact that he hasn’t been already says enough, but the Republicans should never be allowed to forget they relied on him for one stupid vote"
sagmag,"How is ""lying about everything including, maybe, his name"" not breaking campaign laws?"
spaceman757,">""It's not up to me or any other member of Congress to determine whether he can be kicked out for lying.

Yes, it is. That's the exact reason that there is a fucking process for the removal of a congressperson.

It's right in the fucking constitution, which none of these chucklefucks seem to have read:

>**Article I, Section 5, Clause 2:**

>Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member."
downtownbake2,"Can remove George Santos

But 

Can't remove Anthony Devolder (other name he used)

*Taps temple

Such a joke he was even able to walk into congress"
KneebarKing,"But *ONLY* if it was campaign finance laws.

Nothing about the obvious lack of character and integrity. GOP is all about being shitty."
FightingPolish,"Only Congress themselves can remove someone from Congress with a 2/3 majority and do you think that is going to happen with the current Republicans in Congress?

The answer is no."
thistimelineisweird,"There is only one way Santos will be removed from Congress, and that is if he is secretly a Democrat."
mushpuppy,"Santos--or Devolder, or whatever his name is--is so used to lying that he won't mind pressure over it.  He'll just lie more."
KazooDumpkins,I for one want to see his birth certificate
DoomJoint,"Fuck the Supreme Court, they fucked this country with Citizens United."
Seventhchild7,He was married to a woman but is obviously gay. Immigration scam?
volanger,"That would require Republicans to actually have a sense of morality and respect for laws. But we all know their motto ""rules for thee, not for me."""
,Just shows how's broken the American system is.
pottman,If? More like did.
vlu77,It’s wild that the lying is not enough.
Weary-Ad-9218,"If this guy can stay in congress, I suggest some of us  run for a republican seat talking all kinds of maga bs talking points. Ultra maga even. Then when we get sworn in, vote straight Democrat. What are they going to do?"
Artistic-Guava4642,"Campaign finance laws?  Isn’t lying, stealing, cheating and just downright fraudulent good enough? Should have NEVER been allowed into congress to begin with. This is what it has come to in this country"
skeet-skeet-mfer,Treasonous QAnon seditionists who helped lead the Jan 6 insurrection are still in Congress
thisguybuda,"Lying and unqualified? This is fine. 

Fucking with the money? Grounds for removal."
nucumber,"matt gaetz and george santos went on steve bannon's podcast, where gaetz played the victim card for santos, saying ""they come for the fighters"", and santos said ""I've worked an honest life""

meanwhile, the repubs have pretty much emasculated the ethics committee.  that's par for the course."
FUMFVR,He's in a district that's winnable for a Democrat. He's not going to be leaving anytime soon and they aren't going to force him to leave.
BlotchComics,https://archive.ph/8KxfV
Commercial_Yak7468,"Yeah okay, I will fucking believe that when I see it. 

I think it is more likely we will see him move up in Republican leader ship, and I am not joking about thalt"
Selfless_Cephalopod,A politician going to jail for fraud?  That's absolutely unheard of in America.  I'll believe it when I see it.
Icy_Cat1350,Trump committed campaign finance fraud. That won't stop them from supporting him. They already knew Santos was lying about his background and didn't say a word prior to his election. The GOP is just plain corrupt.
usernicktaken,He's a fucking creepy looking goofball.
nuffced,Cut this cancer out before it's too late.
DustBunnyZoo,"So it increasingly looks like the concern with Obama’s birth certificate, the worry about immigration, and the issue of so-called fraudulent voting were all deliberate misdirections by Republicans to get out and in front of their wider campaign to cheat and steal elections by accusing their opponents of their own misdeeds."
caseyc689,"My prediction, he did and he won't be."
Leopold_Darkworth,"Comer can express his own opinion all he wants, but it requires two-thirds of the House to remove a Member. That's 292 votes. I assume all Democrats would vote to expel him, which means 80 Republicans have to agree. The article says McCarthy wants to leave the decision up to ""the Ethics Committee and the voters."" The second part of that sentence tells me McCarthy doesn't want to use the House's power to expel a Member and will instead claim the only ""democratic"" way to remove him is for the voters to express their will (leaving aside the fact that the Constitution expressly permits each house of Congress to remove their own members with a two-thirds vote, regardless of what voters think)."
cannotrememberold,"Unless/until he is jailed or dies, he will serve his full term."
doubtfulisland,"Ha ha, this is who we hold accountable. This is equivalent to Ghislaine Maxwell getting 20 years meanwhile Epstien dies and the rest of the high-ranking public officials and  pedophile were never mentioned in public. Or a traitor to who caused a violent attack on our Capitol Jan 6th, who was also involved with Epstien. We have pictures and video!"
SwnsasyTB,"He's a Republican so their voters could care less about laws broken, morals or ethics.. They only care that there is an R before their name. Republican Voters would vote in a potato if it has an R in its name..."
Hane24,"Trump broke campaign finance laws. He wasn't removed from office, or the presidential ballot, nor has he been banned from running again.

I have very little faith of anything happening here."
DogGroundbreaking568,Nothing was an issue until he messed with the rich people’s money.
jenlucce,"Doubt anything would happen, these people never really face any consequences"
Jerk182,Didn't I read somewhere that he accepted campaign donations from a Russian oligarch? Maybe that oligarch had duel citizenship or something.
PrettiKinx,Le sigh. Only financial fraud can get you kicked out. Not actually lying about your past. Smdh
7foot6er,if they can remove him for campaign finance violations they can remove all of them
FindMercyonMars,"What is wrong with any of you in thinking this is important when somewhere, RIGHT NOW, Hunter Biden has a big dick??


/s"
a-really-cool-potato,"Good, fuck him and throw him in prison"
AFRN,Yes....any day now /s
Sanctimonius,"I'll believe it when I see it. At this point it isn't a case of 'if' he broke the law, it's a matter of how much and how often."
Pake1000,No he won't. Republicans will carve out exception after exception to keep him in that seat.
KNYLJNS,Why is he still there to begin with???
mrsoojay,Yeah I’m not holding my breath
meeplewirp,He can’t just be swiftly removed right now because we don’t know who he really is? This country is set up like garbage
Low_Hornet_5084,Why isn’t considers abuse of funds to raise the funds under false pretenses?
FilthyChangeup55,George Santos invented campaign finance laws
UltimatePax,"Well, good thing Anthony Devolder was in charge of the campaign financing. 

/s"
Yousefer,"He’s a republican. Republicans preach personal responsibility, but never follow through. 

Nothing is going to happen to this guy."
thedefmute,So they are telling us the public that the only thing that matters is money...not ethics.
Necessary-Hat-128,I’ll believe it when I see it.
WolfgangDS,"It doesn't matter if he's guilty of ANYTHING. He could be an illegal immigrant for all we know, and the GOP will fight TOOTH AND NAIL not to lose that seat. The only thing they hate more than immigrants, non-whites, non-Christian, and poor people, is not having power."
Failed-State-2021,"Does this guy even need glasses, are there even lenses in those frames? Lies all lies!!!"
Chennessee,At what point does fraud come in. He convinced people to vote for him under false pretenses. I know politicians lie and all that but this guy went well above the standard.
Big_Country307,"God just look at that booger eater, needs to be licking white dog shit in all his lies"
,[deleted]
Lastnamewaffles,I’ll believe it when I see it
RLoge85,Then another republican similar to him will be elected. The cycle repeats.
BoosterRead78,One thing GOP cares about more than anything is their money.
Agile_Buffalo9785,I'll believe it when I see it. Has any incoming congressman ever been so obviously guilty of blatant and outright fraud and faced consequences?
LauraLikesGrammar,"I would be surprised if Comer is able to convince his colleagues that Santos needs to be removed.  As we've seen since Trump took power seven years ago, nothing in the Trump party matters anymore unless it relates to a Biden.  Maintaining power at all costs, no principles."
QuickAltTab,"Term is 2 years, maybe there is enough outrage to get this moved through the investigative and court processes in a timely manner, but I'm not holding my breath.

Republicans will never voluntarily remove him no matter how damning any public evidence is."
ast01004,If Santos’s is removed and let’s say a few Republican congressman get arrested for a coup is it possible democrats take the majority in the house? How does that work?
DubyaWolf,I’ll believe it when I see it
disseff,Hey look the one slightly correct thing Comer said on State of the Union. The rest of the interview he was a straight up moron and kept acting like Trump/Biden’s document handling were similar. Investigating Hunter but not Kushner too?
T8ert0t,"House Republicans will broker a deal with George Santos, permitting him to remain seated under strict enforcement that he henceforth permanently adopt the persona of Anthony Devolder --- an honest, college graduate and volleyball sensation who quickly became a financial powerhouse, whose previous partners and roommates say nothing but great things about him, and who is committed to listening to constituents of the NY 3rd Congressional District."
shadowdra126,I want to believe this but based on the last 6 years I just can’t
Puredowner,">It's not up to me or any other member of Congress to determine whether he can be kicked out for lying. 

Yes it is. Your party can kick him out for any reason at any time with a 2/3rds vote."
sailorpaul,IF ???  That’s the (R) metric?  My former party has forfeited it’s right to hold office
cwood1973,"Blatantly lie about your life and your accomplishments? No problem. 

Fuck with the money? You're going down."
TheBatmanIRL,GOP won't risk losing a seat. He won't be removed.
essaitchthrowaway,"Yeah ok.  

Sure.

Just like Trump will ever see the inside of a jail cell.

How about people stop talking about this, and start making it happen."
ParenthesisN,"Santos is fine… he will just assume a new identity and stay in office.
Checkmate libs"
Stealthy_Snow_Elf,"I still think it’s hysterical that moderates voted for him. Personally, i think they should keep him, a testament to how people vote demographics or whether certain checkboxes were filled instead of like a history of being committed to change. 

Stop being idiots and you wouldn’t have had him."
bigt503,Yeah right… the gop doesn’t even remotely care about this shit as long as he votes the way they want him too
Mateorabi,"Translation: he’s not politically useful to us, nor connected enough, nor has dirt on us, so we can kick him to the curb because he is inconvenient to us. No morals involved."
Buck7698,"Old scruples: a feeling of doubt or hesitation with regard to the morality or propriety of a course of action.

New scruples: whatever."
Tackleberry06,I think senator scape-goat was brought in to take heat off the other gop circus clowns.
DanimusMcSassypants,Ooh! Ooh!  Do the whole room!
Provolone10,They can’t get rid of him. His grift is just beginning.
BloopityBlue,"""could"" ""if"" ""should"" ""might"" .... These are the headlines that we were pummeled by all during Trump's reign too. Let me know when it happens. Til then, I'm not gonna get all excited about any of it. It's just clickbait headlines to tell people pretty much nothing is happening yet."
ADW83,"I mean.  


They probably will have to speak his True Name to exorcise him."
eldred2,Riiight...Pull the other one.  It has got bells on.
AcidicMonk,Hes a mentally ill power twat.
Hopeful_Cod_8486,If?
GerryOfRavioli,"James Comer is so hard for his investigation of ""The Biden Crime Family"" that he could give two shits and a fuck less about anything else. Also, James Comer and Gym Jordan share the same functioning brain cell."
ProjectRevolutionTPP,No he wont.
Alternative-Flan2869,I will believe it when I see it.
Seagoon_Memoirs,I'll believe it when it happens.
hypotheticalhalf,They’re lowering their he bar to keep him. Don’t fall for this shit. Call your congressperson. Tell them his blatantly lying to his constituents leaves no room for discussion on keeping him sitting in a seat.
TheKingOfDub,Or whatever his name turns out to be
VergerCT,It’s very Democratic of him to say he’ll only resign if he loses the next election. That’s what you do if you lose the election. Well not the Cult leader and followers.
seventener,It's only a matter of time before Sasha Baron Cohen dupes Republican voters and fills a seat in Congress
aquarain,Honestly campaign finance law is engineered to be almost impossible to break.
HuoLongHeavy,If he doesn't get removed for all of the lies then apparently you don't have to tell even a sliver of truth to run pur country. Syaing the quiet part out loud is a terrible precedent.
LittleHornetPhil,"Uh huh, I’ll believe it when I see it.

The last Republican to care about campaign finance laws was McCain."
ThrowHammerDown,He’s not getting removed. Nothing matters anymore since 45 got elected.
klaybie,No way this dude told all those lies but actually followed campaign finance laws lol
Murky-Pass6571,"I’m sure he did. 
I’m sure he won’t."
DonTreason,"So they were OK with all of those other red flags, but don't mess around with campaign finance rules?!?!"
IonTheQuiet,After he lied about anything and everything he still got sworn in. He shouldn't have been sworn in to begin with.
Throwitawaynow31422,I don't have the verbage to describe this guy.
cpray2345,Why should there be a question of removal? This lying disgusting pig belongs in Prison and not in Congress!
mentallo,Just one of the psychopaths in the republican party these days.
RNDASCII,Lol zero chance in hell even if he did! That's just about the least enforced set of laws in existence.
his_rotundity_,Comer is still a piece of shit.
semi-normal-geek,Now do the literal fucking insurrectionists
ImAdork123,Please get it done already and kick him in the nuts on the way out!
Montyw47,Can we be sure he had enough time as a US Citizen before becoming a Congressman? He needs 7 years as a citizen and at least 25 years old. We should be now asking what is TRUE about George Santos not what is a lie. We have seen little truth from or about George Santos. Why won't any federal body ensure he is qualified to retain this congressional seat? Does anyone in D C. care enough about Republicans' qualifications to spend time investigating Mr. Santos
MantisAteMyFace,"Right, right. And, Trump will go to jail for conspiring and sedition."
xiofar,With the speed of our justice system I fully expect this investigation to last 13 years. At that point President “Santos” will self-pardon.
MaxPaul1969,"I doubt it lol, these corrupt goons never face any consequences"
ohfail,"I believe that fraudulently misrepresenting the candidate should easily fall afoul of campaign finance law, but that's just because I'm taking a common-sense approach. I'm sure the actual legalities are much less common sensible and far more byzantine.

All I know is that if I paid for a plumber and an apprentice carpenter showed up instead, I'd get my money back."
rockchalkchuck,"Broken laws? By the time they get a handle on what his real name is it'll be 2026 and he'll be starting his 3rd term. Come on people, have you seen the timeline we live in? It's not the ""George Santos is convicted of crimes"" version."
PrimevilKneivel,">House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said he will leave Santos' fate to the Ethics Committee and voters.

Kevin, lift with your legs or you will throw out your back passing the buck."
grigsbie,Breaking all of the other laws was fine though?
Tokyosmash,Should be removed anyway.
ZealousWolverine,"Santos is just a symptom. Just like Trump is just a symptom. America is a land of lies and our dirty dishonest politicians are a reflection of that.

Debate me if you think Trump could have been president in an honest country with honest media and honest business people."
petercasimir,I thought Republicans were forced to carry babies to full term
StephCurryMustard,This country is an absolute joke.
chalkoutlin3,"I particularly like the part where the gqp is ok with him lying to get votes.. yet somehow draw the line when it comes to money… garbage, the lot of them…"
NostradamusJones,"The honor system is out, unless Republicans are breaking an explicit law they don't care."
MarameoMarameo,But not because he is a piece of shit and a liar?
gofuggyoself,But lying.. That's just being republican
fatgirlballet,I'm actually surprised at how many republicans are calling for his resignation.
raresanevoice,Campaign finance is the thing they care enough about... cause it took from another gop
frozetadpole,Is this guy a Russian plant!? Definitely plausible
