Rickmyross,"My Grandfater, who passed in 2021 at 88 years old, played the shit out of Ocarina Of Time and Majoras Mask. He had a notebook with all the songs written out in it, and maps he made, and notes about everything he needed. Miss him a lot, and this post totally brings back great memories."
zehalper,"My mom's 67, she's always played Mario 1&3 on our NES.

Then she borrowed my GBA to play through basically all the Mario and Mario-like platformers there were. Then onto the DS.

And then the 3ds... and then I had to tell her, there weren't really any more, and she'd played through everything countless times. (couldn't convincer of a switch, it is ""too big"").

So then I managed to get her to play Link Between Worlds. And besides having to help her with a couple of bosses, she got through it. 

5 times so far."
daluxe,That walking thing turns out to be a really good holder for a sword and shield. Looks cool.
Moody_GenX,"They were probably in their mid 30s when it came out. I hope I'm still gaming when I'm their age.


Edit: Since my incorrect guess at their age has made some people angry I am changing my guess to pre teens. Enjoy!

Edit: I get it guys, they were most likely in their 40s. üòÇ"

LarxII,My Grandmother was actually the one to introduce me to gaming. Playing Super Mario Bros on the NES and legend of Zelda on the Super NES with her where some of my earliest memories. Probably my fondest with her are of us playing Ape Escape on PS1 and Orcaraina of Time on 64.
Kynku,Ngl. Relationship goals
Rocketmonk,"Cool Zelda cosplay, who's the lady dressed as?

/s"
batkevn,"My introduction to gaming was before I could even hold my head up. My grandpa would sit cross-legged and lay me on his lap and play the original Link and Zelda on NES while drawing maps on graph paper. He would later pit us cousins against each other with Link to the Past to see who could complete the game with the fewest deaths. He taught me to be patient with RPGs and EXPLORE because you never know what you might find. Sadly, he passed, but I still play using his methods."

psychinchicago,"Kudos to these guys. I love it! 

We're 40 now and our elderly parents always say ""when are you going to grow up? "" when they catch us playing video games after the kids are in bed. I hope I'm still playing Zelda until the point where I can't."

ArokLazarus,"When I was a kid one of my earliest memories is my mom bringing me along when she went to visit someone. I don't know if it was a friend or relative but all I remember was the man showing me The Legend of Zelda for the NES and I was blown away. I wasn't able to read but had been playing games like Mario already. Even at that age the game blew my mind and I still remember thinking how cool the gold cartridge was. He even had a Game Genie to go with it! Though at the time I didn't know what that was. 

The craziest thing though was he showed me that you could save your progress and little kid me was dumbfounded. I was unable to fathom how such a thing was possible. 

One of my earliest memories that I forgot about until now."
NobleR3dditor,Zelda: The Epolouge
MegamanD,"My mawmaw was the reason I loved video games and the Legend of Zelda on the NES. She got a Nintendo back in 86 and thought my sister and I (I was born in 85) would love it. My earliest gaming memories was watching her beat The Legend of Zelda. She remembered were every burnable bush was, every bomb wall....great memories. To these two, absolutely wonderful to see."

MemzMusic,"This reminds me of a little story from way back in the day while I worked at a GameStop. I worked in a pretty small store in a mall and most of the time I worked alone, the evenings were usually chill and few customers stopped by. 

One such evening in December an old lady, I'd say like 75-80 years old, came by the store and looked around in the Nintendo Wii section. I asked her if she needed any help, and she answered that she was looking for ""Zelda, Skyward Sword"". I was kind of impressed that she named the actual title of the game, considering she was an old Norwegian lady with (what I assumed was) limited exposure to such media. I asked something along the lines of ""Is it a gift for someone?"" and she answered, ""Oh no, I've been looking forward to this one for years!"" with a big smile."

TF31_Voodoo,"I love this so much, I lost my granddad in July, and he wasn‚Äôt a super gamer but when I was a kid he would always ask me questions about the games I liked and why I liked them and we‚Äôd talk about the strategy I was using and he‚Äôd give me advice and I found out after he died that he‚Äôd go and buy the game guides for my favorite games and read them so he could talk to me about them and help me through the tough parts I‚Äôd get stuck on.

He was the best."

Altair_Khalid,Hell yeah! Love this üòÉ
Glassjaww,"It's always seemed weird to me, that considering the massive success the gaming industry has seen over the last 35 or so years, seeing something like this is still such a rare occurence. When you hit that age where health and mobility issues prevent you from getting out or enjoying other hobbies, gaming would be a great distraction. I feel like video games are massively stigmatized by seniors to the point where seeing someone over 70 enjoying them is like a unicorn sighting. Such a shame. My grandfather passed 2 years ago and was a huge fan of old western movies. He would have been blown away by RDR2."
