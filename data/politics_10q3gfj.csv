Mr_Stiel,"Remember when Hillary Clinton took the fifth amendment 400 times during the Benghazi hearings? Nope. That was Donald Trump, Hilary answered questions for 11 hours because she’s not a criminal traitor."
3dddrees,It’s my understanding that taking the fifth with regards to the upcoming civil procedings can be rather costly. Ain’t that just too bad.

newfrontier58,">Once the preliminary questions wrapped up, Trump was given an opportunity to read a prepared statement into the record.  
He began with a familiar refrain: ""This is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country.""  He called James ""a renegade and out of control prosecutor"" and accused her of having political motives for her office's investigation into his financial practices.   
Just over a month later, on Sept. 21, James announced her office's lawsuit against Trump, three of his children and his company, accusing them of a long-running scheme to inflate the value of their properties. The Trumps have denied wrongdoing.  
""This whole thing is very unfair,"" Trump says in the deposition video.  
""Anyone in my position not taking the Fifth Amendment would be a fool, an absolute fool,"" Trump said, adding that on the advice of counsel, ""I respectfully decline to answer the questions under the rights and privileges afforded to every citizen under the United States Constitution.  
>  
>""This will be my answer to any further questions.""  
Senior enforcement counsel Kevin Wallace, of the attorney general's office, noted ""for the record"" that the statement was ""lengthy,"" and that ""obviously, we disagree with a lot of the characterizations."" Wallace then began his questioning, which would comprise the bulk of the deposition.  
At the outset, Trump responded to three questions by saying, ""For all of the reasons provided in my answer, which is incorporated herein in its entirety, I decline to answer the question.""    
Wallace then told Trump he could just say, ""same answer"" — ""to speed things up.""   
Trump did so more than 400 times during the course of the full interview, according to sources. After the deposition concluded, Trump issued a public statement saying that he had exercised his Fifth Amendment right and refused to answer.  
During one section of questioning, Wallace asked Trump about his Statements of Financial Condition, submitted every year since 2011. In February 2022, the accounting firm that prepared them recanted its work and said those reports ""should no longer be relied upon.""  
""The valuations contained in this document reflect false and misleading valuation statements; is that correct?"" Wallace asked.

CBSnews,"Here's a preview of our exclusive story by reporter Graham Kates: 

Newly released video obtained by CBS News provides the first look at former President Donald Trump's deposition last summer in the New York attorney general's civil fraud investigation. 

Trump sat for questioning under oath on Aug. 10, and the video shows him politely answering the opening questions from state Attorney General Letitia James.

Wearing a dark blue suit, red tie and American flag lapel pin, sitting in front of a camera in a downtown Manhattan conference room, Trump answered ""yes"" when asked by James if he was familiar with the rules for giving a deposition. But as the questioning about his finances began in earnest, the former president—and now candidate for that same office—invoked the Fifth Amendment and continued to do so for nearly four hours.

\*Trump's attorney advises he read the statement prepared, which he refuses to do.

AG suggests we go off the record.

Trump then begins to read his statement:

**Trump:**  ""This is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country. There has been another president and perhaps another politician who has been persecuted, harassed and in every other way unfairly treated, like President Donald J. Trump. What Leticia James has tried to do the last number of years is a disgrace to the legal system and a front to the NY State tax payers, and a violation of the solemn rights of the US Constitution. She developed a political platform and made a career out of maliciously attacking me and my business before she even understood or was elected or reviewed one of the millions of pages of documents we willing produced. We willingly produced these documents. She announced that she quote 'was obsessed with taking me on', taking me on folks..... This whole thing is very  unfair."" He then goes into talking about Michael Cohen being a ""total loser.""

What a fucking wanker man, this is the former president of the free world acting like an petulant child. I will enjoy watching him squirm in more depositions like this, Leticia James plus the Georgia election need to never let up on this disgrace. May god do the world a favor and deliver the justice and accountability this man has managed to avoid for his entire lifetime.

Edit:

He also brings up how he  did once reference those who bring up the 5th are part of the mafia, and **now he understands why someone would do that, and anyone in his position would be an absolute fool to not take the 5th.** Because of course, this asshole cant stand by anything other than self serving options.

AG James  
How do...

Trump:  
Fif! I like to show all of you a secret document!

\[pulls out a piece of paper saying ""FiF""\]

Trump:  
Fiiiiiiiiiiiiif!"
Ditka85,He should t be allowed to say “same” or “fifth”. Instead he should be forced to go through the whole “Upon advice of counsel…”. Make it a pain in the ass for him too.
Timely_Look7855,Claiming the fifth by anyone is an admission of guilt. Trump even said that himself. Now do any of you Trump Republicans want to argue with me on that one? I think not!
-CoachMcGuirk-,I'm surprised he can count that high....

Condfgha,why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?”
rap31264,"Trump has suggested on many occasions that people who invoke their right against self-incrimination are guilty. “You see the mob takes the Fifth,” Trump said during a 2016 rally in Iowa. “If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?"
