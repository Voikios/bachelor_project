ThoseWhoAre,"I honestly upgraded my rat play to use the VZ Klobb. It was so much fun to run in and get in gunfights with chads and two mans.   Always a good day when you ""Klobb"" a two man and skedaddle with their kits."
Arcanu,I am enjoying the game more when I am doing the chad runs way more. The best part is that you have absolutely no fear also you train your aim better  because headshot are the only way to kill.
