baconsword420,"This guy’s gonna be a congressman for two years, isn’t he?"
sakri,Put that nail in the bulging potato sack with trumps final nails
buried_lede,"If I were a hostile nation, I would run candidates in every red state for Congress. This is so easy"
mattd1972,"I am so sick and fucking tired of the ‘final nail on the coffin’ stories for the last 7 years. Nothing will change. Roger Ailes got his evil wish. Once there’s media you control, you can do any damn thing you want."
,[deleted]
Great-Heron-2175,And just like that the gop makes it legal to sign other people’s signatures
gunnesaurus,X doubt. He’s a Republican and they’re ok with these kind of people. Prove me wrong
Skyfork,This coffin is basically 100% nails at this point.
exixx,Narrator: It wasn’t the final nail in the coffin
1st_Ave,"It’s a Trump-like news cycle “The next reveal is really the final straw!” No, no it’s not."
Mcdibbles,"I know this guy is a congressional lulcow, but keep in mind, Matt Gaetz sex trafficked children and nothing happened to him.  By comparison, Santos ain't as bad.

We need an overhaul of our justice system.  It seems to be wholly incapable of prosecuting the owning class in this country."
BelleAriel,Are there any republicans not corrupt at this point?
Seventhchild7,Forge Santos?
prescience6631,"Could be, but it won’t be….’imminent’, ‘possibly devastating’, etc etc etc 

Nothing ever F’ng happens. Period. Full stop. 

Constant clickbait every-single-day since 2016"
ReadySetN0,"The fact that GQP leadership has refused to condemn this dipshit any step of the way, shows exactly what state the GQP is in.

They don't give a shit who gets elected, as long as they have a little R next to it.

They have sex traffickers, pedophiles and now someone who has lied about every aspect of their life in their elected ranks."
humboldt77,"If an armed insurrection doesn’t get a Republican prosecuted, I don’t see why this would harm Santos."
stochasticschock,"It's astonishing that even after he's been forced to walk back so many lies, Santos still--this week--signed someone else's name to his campaign filing. How did he imagine that he would get away with it? With all the extra scrutiny his actions are under, how could he think that forging a signature was the best way forward?"
LeftFieldBlue,"Four years of Trump taught me to never pay a lick of attention to ""this is going to be the thing that makes it end"" - taglines."
yoyoJ,"He’s not going anywhere as long as he’s useful.

Remember: the people in congress are some of the most cynical and morally bankrupt humans one could find on the planet. 

This is all a game to them and the end goal is power and wealth. That’s why they got into these positions and that’s all they’re after. 

A majority of congresspeople do not give a fuck about democracy, about the citizens they represent, about their own country, and they especially don’t give a fuck about you or anyone you love."
gentleman_bronco,Final nail on the coffin....for his fast track to GOP poster child
collectivignoramus,How many nails does this guys coffin need? Good grief.
DenturesDentata,I won't hold my breath. This is the new standard for the GQP.
ting_bu_dong,"... Or maybe not!  Maybe it's actually impossible to hold a conservative accountable for literally anything they do!

*STAY TUNED!*"
officegeek,"Santos isn't a result of corruption, he's a result of espionage."
ScholarZero,"Oh it's a nail in the coffin, all right, but it's not through the lid."
Go4Lo,"Welcome to /r/politics, your one-stop shop for synonyms of “possibly” in every goddamn post headline."
Mother_Yak_1757,"Christ you can't even prosecute Trump, I doubt you'd be able to get rid of this fuck-wad.

But if he was poor, he'd be serving 3 life terms...,"
LeicaM6guy,"“Could.”

The last few years have left my deeply cynical and pessimistic. I’ll be more interested when something actually happens to the man."
Final-Distribution97,He can break the law without consequence  just like the rest of them.  He has money behind him.
Romnonaldao,"He's registered Republican, therefore he is immune to all laws and consequences. They could find out he was the Zodiac Killer and Jack the Ripper, and he'd get nothing more than a weak finger wag."
terremoto25,"> He said: ""It's completely illegal to sign somebody else's name on a federal filing without their consent. That is a big, big no-no.""


What the fuck??? 

A big fucking No-no? 

How about felony fraud? Jesus fucking chridst, I can’t even with this bullshit."
mang9444,Give him a break. He’s pregnant!
JC2535,Don’t worry. Molasses Garland will appoint a special counsel in a year or two to look into it.
notochord,His coffin has more nails in it than a hellraiser cenobite.
Then_I_had_a_thought,Narrator: “it wasn’t”
leafwings,Impressive how many nails these GOP coffins can take
gauriemma,Wearing a blazer over a quarter-zip and a quarter-zip with a tie should have been the final nail.
mild-hot-fire,His outfits remind me of the kids in high school who only goal in life was to be a “businessman”
ctguy54,We have heard this all too often regarding tump. The republicans will never turn on one of their own.  The only way he will be out of the House is when the voters of that district vote in the next election.
Nthepeanutgallery,There needs to be an intervention to not only remove him from office but get him the significant psychological help he clearly needs.  The story of George Santos is on course to end in suicide - these are not the actions of a well person and it's irresponsible for McCarthy and the rest of the GOP to keep enabling him. This has lost its amusement value.
Green-Snow-3971,">George Santos has been accused of listing a man as his campaign financier against his wishes and using his signature without consent

Bout fucking tired of this wishy washy, lipstick on a pig bullshit from the press. An ""untruth"" is a *lie*! ""Using a signature without their consent"" is *forgery!* 

He's been accused of **forgery**. A **crime**."
JBoomhauerIII,Narrator: it wasn’t
SpikesEvilTwin,"If anything, this should make Santos a contender for a top committee appointment?  The new face of the gop maga cult . . . a lying proud boy drag queen!"
dalgeek,How many nails does this coffin need? At this point it's more nails than coffin.
Endyo,This guy has basically done everything wrong that could possibly be done wrong and the Republican party continues to support him.
Mail540,This coffin is more nails than wood at this point. I’ll believe it when I see him actually held accountable
PerNewton,"TIL Democrat coffins have one nail, GOP coffins have an infinite number of nails."
Iamanadultsometimes,Who needs Netflix when I have American politics to watch every day
Aesthete,It's more nails than wood at this point
Protonbox22,"Just like republican politicians COULD face charges for j6.....Who the fuck cares about could? Fucking do your god damn jobs and arrest the openly declared enemies of the United States! They legally cannot hold office after the insurrection!!! Good god the role of government is to safeguard citizens from threats foreign and DOMESTIC as well as preserve stability of the country they're doing none of these things! Having declared seditionists in government is a gast track to instability. The people act like its all gonna get fixed by these worthless assholes its delusion.

What is the point of tolerating this government if they can't even deal with such low hanging fruit....sediton will win if the people keep doing nothing. General strike, boycotts, mass civil disobedience. The reason people listen to republicans in D.C. is they carry the threat of civil war or right wing terrorism if they are ignored. It turns out backing up your words goes a long way to get change.....learn from this and adapt accordingly or watch your nightmares come true because no one could be bothered."
Cosmo317,I have fully given up on any justice being served to corrupt politicians.
Arctic-cookie,Didn't we all say this about trump? Dude has committed serious crime and countless evidence and still free smh
Jerk182,"Another ""could be"" article. Boring!"
TheLastNacho,How many nails does this coffin have?!
Guardian808ttg,Dude looks like a tubby 5th grader.
Romas_chicken,"Reminder:
Al Franken had to resign from the Senate because he once took an inappropriate joke picture in 2006"
berael,"Spoiler alert:

There are no consequences for Republicans."
DamNamesTaken11,"If the GOP had any dignity, they would have forced him out long before. 

If they had a trace of it, they would have done so when it came out that he stole money for a veteran’s service dog’s operation. 

They won’t care that he forged his financial consultant/treasurer’s signature so long as he votes how they want him to vote."
Devolutionary76,"He will be the next trump. Everyday there will be a new nail in his coffin, until it is a coffin of solid iron. Unfortunately, like trump, they will forget he is supposed to be inside it when they nail it shut."
Ivorcomment,"Someday a Broadway musical will centre around George Santos. Its hit number will be entitled ""It's Springtime in Washington for Devolder""."
Tim-in-CA,"I mean, how many nails does it take to keep this guy’s coffin closed?"
Exodys03, “Using his signature without consent”?  Isn’t that what we used to call forgery?
bcallihan513,He is a perfect representation of modern conservatives. They really do have a type.
politirob,"""final nail in the coffin"" for what?

the republicans that could vote him out, won't, because he's not a person to them, he's a convenient vote."
Coccquaman,"If having classified and top secret documents at an elected official's private residence isn't the final nail in any elected official's coffin, a fraudulent signature isn't going to be Santos's."
Person21323231213242,If there's anything I know about Santos - its that this isn't the last nail. Nor is it the one that will truly hold him in the coffin.
Ill-Organization-719,Why would it be? He's a republican.
JaD__,"Keep the deranged mythomaniac around. He repulses everyone, likely including a healthy number of GOP voters; the longer the party goes out of its way to cravenly accommodate the visceral charlatan, the better. 

It signals transparent desperation. 

Besides, we all know it’s just a matter of time before the shallow graves are discovered."
nicky416dos,"Narrator: ""It wasn't"""
TheOneTheOnlyMe2,Dude looks like that Pat character on SNL
Findilis,"He is a republican there will be zero repercussions. 

The have done every thing from de stabilizing Vietnam peace talks, to Iran Contra, to Haliburton, to Mar Lago.

That does not include the 50 years of rape, assault, infidelity,  voter suppression,  vote fraud,  and pedophiles.


My guess is all this raises him in the faux news polls."
_SpaceTimeContinuum,He's a Republican politician.  He can get away with anything.  There is no justice when the rich or powerful break the law.
ronin1066,">House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has refused to move against Santos, claiming he does ""not have the power"" as ""his constituents voted for him.

So all impeachments are off the table,  Kevin? Forever?"
mrbigglessworth,Could be.  So tried of all the could and should and may words that surround obviously corrupt politicians
micromoses,Why do these coffins require so many nails?
win_awards,"Would be nice to see _one_ of these fuckers face some consequences, but why would they start now?"
or10n_sharkfin,"He'll face no consequences until he gets voted back into office two years from now.

Sorry for the cynicism but it's just a tired trope from the R side of things. We need to do better as a country."
DoubleDragon2,"if Santos was a Dem, he would have been gone before the swearing in, what the heck Rep????"
cheebamech,at this point I'm unsure whether George or Rafael are the Zodiac Killer
seethelighthouse,"Is there any benefit to the GOP, Santos, or his constituents if Santos resigns? They literally don't care as long as he votes the way they want him to. And honestly, it's hard to argue against that. The only way the party or his constituents will really do anything to actually get him removed is if he stops voting in line with their interests."
Positive_Stable7799,This man is the real life Rodger from American Dad
distelfink33,I’ll believe it when he’s gone.
tanzmeister,Surely *this* will stop ~~Donald Trump~~ George Santos.
SignificanceJust1497,I’m convinced you could run a Democrat as a Republican and they would still win because their name says (R) in front of it
Galliro,"Doesnt matter hes republican he could shit on the floor of the oval office and theyd defend him, and lets be honest probably praise him for it"
Toosmallhands,"This isn’t just the republicans; this is representative of what America has become. Liars, frauds, fakes, schemers, scammers and trouble makers; and thats just the short list. Its time we either accept this is who we are, or we do more so this isn’t the scum representing us and our entire country. Over and over again."
HadrianMQ,Wish someone from his district would take him home. If he was representing me I’d would be… furious and fighting mad. We’d be on that piece of trash’s door step demanding he stop speaking for me and my neighbors.
silentjay01,"If the movie they make about this man isn't called, ""The Truth About George Santos"" I am going to be very disappointed."
tk421jag,So when is he gonna be the GOP nominee for president? That's what I expect the next headline to be.
ChefMike1407,McCarthy is an idiot for putting Santos on the Science committee.
bloodycpownsuit,"“House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has refused to move against Santos, claiming he does ‘not have the power’ as ‘his constituents voted for him.’”

That’s the thing though…. They didn’t vote for him. The person they voted for doesn’t exist."
DaneLimmish,It won't mean jack shit until republicans are sure they have a replacement
EL3MENTALIST,Note to self…. Invest in Coffin nails…
ThatsFairZack,"It’s so crazy. Like the first time I heard about George Santos it was like “oh man a congressman caught up in a lie, I wonder how it will develop.”

And you would think it was just one lie about one thing. And people called the man a liar that made up his entire history and resume, but it’s almost comical just HOW much lying this guy has done. It’s EVERYTHING. The dude probably isn’t even a human. He probably doesn’t even exist."
blueblurz94,George Santos isn’t even a person. He’s an idea
deepsea333,"> Datwyler has also been contacted to enquire whether he plans to take any action against the newly elected Republican.


“Enquire” ? No."
Bagelchongito69,His real name… Dick Whitman.
Hot-Bint,"Why do publications keep doing this? *Nothing* is going to happen to this guy. Nothing. Ken Paxton was indicted in 2015 and has yet to stand trial. Homie, please"
the_real_abraham,Good thing he didn't scream at the end of a speech.
hunter15991,"Yes, and I could be the next starting quarterback for the Cardinals."
unndunn,"Every time I see the word “could” in a headline like this, I mentally replace it with the word “won’t”. Much more accurate."
hypedad__,A lot of fucking nails in this coffin to be fair
ColombianLandSloth,Could be but won't be. Republican politicians are immune to consequences
Memewalker,"If Trump can get away with what he did, there is no way anything will come if this."
bencarswell,"""Final nail in the coffin"" as they hammer the fifteenth nail in"
millos15,He fits sooo well in the gop. Why are they pushing him aside 🤔
cantwinfornothing,Lie cheat and steal it’s the GOP way and they’re not going to do anything to him or about it as long as he votes the way they want him to! They know they’ll lose his seat to a democrat if they do anything to push him out business as usual for the republicans!
schizoballistic,"This is an OP by Republicans to see what they can get away with.  This is fucked up. 

You wonder why 75%of this country doesn't trust the govt."
protonfreetome,What ever happened to that one congressman that was caught sleeping with the chinese spy and then shit his pants on live tv? that sort of just fell off the news cycle and disapeard.
hatsnatcher23,Dudes got more nails in his coffin than wood at this point.
Gummyrabbit,Apparently he’s a vampire.  So nails won’t keep him down.
TexMurphyPHD,Not only will he not be removed i would not at all be surprised if he gets reelected in 24
BlandingBlakah,It won't be
Ok-Faithlessness1679,Not if republicans need his vote.
QAPetePrime,"How cute.  His DNA could be found all over, and inside, a corpse and the GOP would not remove him."
