TrustedJoy,"It's so you can automate it. The default can only be hand crafted.
Surprisingly I did not know this for a long time because one of my mods allowed miners to be automated with the default recipe"
The_Bones672,"I don’t like taking up the inventory slots to carry around the miners from a central base point - to where ever I wish to place a MK3 miner.  Therefore,  i put down an equipment work shop next to the resource node.   Make the 3 portable miners, make the MK3 miner, then demolish the work shop.  Rinse and repeat.  I don’t really get this alt recipe either.  But, that’s just me."
JinkyRain,"If nuclear pasta can stack... Portable miners should too, dang it. ;)"
DurzoSteelfin,"Intentionally, not all recipes are good recipes"
KalIsSatisfactorized,"There was a recent discussion about this:

I guess if you're a completionist and are trying to automate everything, this would be for you."
Vencam,To mock the lack of automated inhalers ![img](emote|t5_gs464|9160)
Mallardguy5675322,Beacons too actually. Why do I need crystal oscillators to make a beacon?!
sleepylizard52,Automation
RayeNGames,Wtf that exists?
gendulf,So the only reason I can see this be useful would be automating them to then go into a drone for delivery wherever you might need them (by placing a drone pad).
Moose_Nuts,"It's in preparation for the upcoming ""maintenance"" update where all automated miners break down and require portable miners to repair.

J/K, that cause a riot."
subzeroab0,It allows them to be automated to be used in drones production.
corporalhicks42,Pretty good question. You only use them in drones and Mineral miners... So no Real reason to automate them.
houghi,"Why not? I hope they add all the other things to be able to make. I had a lot of fun doing it. It is a Factory Building Game. I like Building factories. I would love to make chainsaws and carts and anything else that you now can only make in the workshop.

If it is a ""bad"" alternative, even better. After all they are alternatives, not improvements. I would love to make some very complex way to make carts.  Especially if you would need something like a lot of things to produce just 1. Like 1000 screws, 2 Nuclear Pasta, 4 turbo motors and 3.1415  heavy modular frames for 0.1 per minute. Or whatever weird thing they can come up with.

There are things in the game I do not use, but others are very happy about."
ICANTTHINK0FNAMES,"This one can be automated, while the other cannot."
Treacle_Individual,"portable miners are needed to build and upgrade miners, its just another recipe for them. there are alot of alternative recipes some good some ehhh  just options to choose from :-)"
Oldenodd,In late game it can get annoying quite quickly  having to hand-craft 3 portable miners every time you want a Mk3 miner so it's nice to have an ISC full of them handy.
Etherius,"Well one can be made in a manufacturer and the other can only be made at an equipment workshop

Yes it’s dumb, almost no one at manufacturer level is making portable miners"
Canadarm_Faps,"I had to go out and upgrade all my miners to mk3 for phase 4, so I automated the portable miner production to save from hand crafting them all."
plenebo,I use it
PrincessClubs,If a client orders 1000 portable miners are you really gonna do that by hand?
loafers5,"I feel like it's a toss up whether ""Why miner alt?"", ""Look at my bridge!"" or ""I put something heavy on the space bar!"" posts are more common at this point. At least the bridge ones look pretty."
KilroyLichKing,"it is handy to have this automated, that way you can just grab 12 of them from a bin and then run around and place mk3 miners"
nucleargandhi3000,In theory it might be useful to automate eventually with stuff added in other updates although as of yet it’s just needed for miners and drones iirc.
GaffJuran,"Save resources, get around shortages, streamline the process. Depends on what you pick."
StructureOk8023,Crafting them is below me!
kale_boriak,For mining of course! How else will you fill the containers that feed your machines?
NinjaBr0din,Don't have to build them by hand.
Ok_Suspect3871,Probably the worst recipe in the entire game
EightBitRanger,Maybe I don't want to craft them by hand.
binhoboys,On my second play through I knew I needed hundreds if not thousands of these so its one of the first things I automated. Now anytime im building a new factory I can just grab 50 or so. Ezpz
HabibJihad,"The real builder will need a storage unit full of these. Why do I keep seeing these posts? Come correct, ffs."
