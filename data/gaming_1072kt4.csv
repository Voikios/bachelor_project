BobOki,"How to WFH correctly.

#1. Make a room an office
#2. Do not put in a tv or other distractions
#3. Put a door on it that you can close, when closed you are working
#4. Do not play games or watch youtube during work
#5. Do not ruin it for everyone else because you want to be immature. Do your damn job.

WFH already is super flexible, allowing you to take moments to get food, run a errand, etc. Please do not ruin it for everyone else because you want to act like you are a teenager."

Are you left or right handed? If you're facing that direction, your mouse will always be on your left, won't it? It seems like playing a keyboard and mouse game wouldn't work terribly well in that configuration."
