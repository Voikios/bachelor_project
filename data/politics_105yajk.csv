bluebastille,"Kiss the ring, bend the knee, lick the boot. 

McCarthy, an invertebrate, will also change colors on command."
Critical_Aspect,">""Kind of a disgusting moment right there. And it also shows exactly the kind of person Kevin McCarthy is.""

We're going to have a front row seat to McCarthy's disgusting behavior over the next two years--provided his caucus doesn't turn on him before then."
fowlraul,And 100% on brand after 14 failed ballots. What a tool.
Shiplord13,"Well McCarthy is a disgusting person in general, so not surprising."
Kantsas,So the new speaker is an apologist for a seditionist?
TintedApostle,"The right wing doesn't care what their team does. We have an accused pedo, a proven liar, and a guy who stole national secrets in this mix last night and the people on the right yell Pelosi and Dems are at fault."
Hiranonymous,"Is McCarthy praising “National Security Document Thief Trump?”  That Trump?  McCarthy is praising him?

Nah, that can’t be right."
BrutalOutThere,The GOP hates you and wants you and your family to be poor and miserable for the rest of your lives.
jdf025,That ex GOP rep should grow a spine and realize they've built this
rounder55,Should make the Republican primary all the more fun. Trump can claim that only he could bring the party together and that Ron DeFascist can't even run a state or something or other
quotesforlosers,"I watched his first speech last night. Personally, I would’ve thought there would be more humility and discussion of important topics for the American people. Instead, he proposed to end “wokeness in schools” and “investigating the Afghanistan withdrawal.” Not to mention, they’re still pushing border security (whatever that means).

Having said that, what I found most chilling was when Rep. Jeffries was giving his speech and stated that America was a diverse nation of people from all backgrounds and races, the GOP just sat there with their arms folded. The GOP can applaud all kinds of crazy theories, take selfies, and even storm the damn capitol, but when it comes to saying that America is diverse, they want to protest in silence? All I can say is fuck that."
gulfpapa99,Just another GOP insurrectionist.
umaniaxublewitup,"Just another spineless, zero integrity republican. Nothing new"
Narrator2012,So the House Jan 6 committee hearings didn't move Republicans one inch on whether insurrection and sedition are bad?
kthulhu666,You have to admit that Kevin McCarthy is uniting the country in its contempt for Kevin McCarthy.
joshdoereddit,"""While Democrats have built a coalition in the last six years of disaffected Republicans and independents, joining their cause for healthcare, education, immigration reform, and criminal justice reform, Republicans have built a coalition of insurrectionists, white nationalists, antisemites, and other people who want to tear down the government, and so that's what we're seeing on display.""

Yup. That's the real big tent that the GOP likes to say they have."
fellowuscitizen,Another Putin proxy.
,Most things the GOP does is disgusting.
digiorno,The GOP knows they’re ulikely to win the presidency again if they anger the MAGA base to much. They need that support so much that they’ll keep paying lip service too them. And if push comes to shove they’ll run another fascist if that’s the only way to keep their support.
TintedApostle,yeah say s EX GOP rep.  These people all resigned and left us to clean up.
FortySixAndYou,And disgustipating.
left_right_left,"He pulled back his disgusting comment the next day about holding Trump accountable at all, hence why the Jan 6 committee appears bipartisan to half the country. He's part of the syncophants, just not open about it."
,"If you try and overthrow the government and democracy of the United States of America, that should be a lifetime ban as far as ass-kissing goes"
MarameoMarameo,The whole Republican Party is a pile of dog shit.
Wraywong,"""Our country is worth fighting for...""

Translation: No repercussions for members of congress who aided & abetted the Jan 6 riot."
flimspringfield,"From a CNN article:

""Asked why he reversed course on McCarthy, Gaetz said, “I ran out of things I could even imagine to ask for.”""

Talk about giving up your dignity and ideals."
ItsAllBullshitFromMe,"Whichever Democrat shouted, ""On your knees,"" as McCarthy walked up to Gaetz is hilarious."
throw123454321purple,"McCarthy’s an embarrassment to us Californians. He doesn’t even represent any major population centers, unless you count Bakersfield.

Also, he has no penis that we are aware of."
Technical-Memory-241,"Fuck Trump and Kevin,"
YourUndoing,$10 says that thanking Trump was one of the concessions that he had to make lol
AtomicBlastCandy,Ex….Republicans find their courage on the way out the door
Precaseptica,"Good god, you Americans sure have some shameless politicians"
EnochScribe,Fauxmer President Trump*
Big_Palpitation7095,Idiot bar none
Looney_Tunes_99,Going to be a painful couple of years having to listen to this idiot and his cronies.
hamsterfolly,It’s always the Ex-Republican that suddenly has a conscious
Junketway,"[Hear](https://youtu.be/rht4c4dTVlY?t=25) McCarthy blaming Trump for the insurrection.

McCarthy's thirst for power knows no bounds."
lordofedging81,"He also promised them literally that he will give any House member oral sex upon demand.

The concessions he made aren't public, so until they ARE made public, I'm believing this is a possibility..."
It_is_I_Satan,The entire party is fucking disgusting.
akuma211,"McCarthy, what a sad pathetic tool. Trump would shit on him and his wife and this guy would thank him lmao"
BirdLawyer50,Shame these spineless assholes can’t say this while they’re in power and mean anything
radewagon,"Yeah, that's something alright. Hot off the heals of becoming one of the most powerful republicans in the nation, he chooses to express fealty to a private citizen whom many blame for the poor midterm performance of his party. Which is nothing to say for all the other things associated with said individual."
robodrew,"McCarthy is debasement taken human form, so this is just par for the course."
DevoidHT,Alway Ex never current. They’re all cowards.
Leviathan3333,This is a case study of why sucky people run the world. Because they just won’t give up until they get what they want and will say anything to get it.
TechSalesSoCal,\#1 Rule in dealing with terrorists is that we do not negotiate with terrorists.  He shit the bed on that one.
Q_OANN,"McCarthy getting some pass like he isn’t maga is driving me crazy, dude is just as nuts."
stlredbird,Spineless sack of shit
orangesfwr,"Well he's a disgusting spineless excuse for a human being.  This is what passes for ""leadership"" in the GOP."
fartemous_foul,"Oh boy, for a second I thought the GOP was going to distance themselves from Trump because of the midterms.

Nope, republicans are still led by Donald Trump. That should keep the left engaged and voting."
Bellamac007,The fact trump is walking the streets a free man is disgusting
Tigger3-groton,"On the second anniversary of Trump’s attempt at an insurrection we find the democrats praying on the capitol steps.  The republicans were engaging in bribery to get one of their “leaders” elected as speaker of the House, another gained election through lies and deception, some of them may have participated in the conspiracy around the insurrection, and the majority of them offered fealty to a former president who may face criminal charges for that insurrection, improper handling of classified documents, and other actions.  The difference is like night and day, guess which one craves the darkness."
jimmydean885,Always ex gop
fellowuscitizen,McCarthy is despicable.
Early_Gold,Why? They support what Trump did. Of course they're thanking him.
Erazerhead-5407,He’s a poor facsimile of a man who has been publicly castrated by his own party members.
Snack_attack13,"For being the party of the “tough guy”, these guys are all cowards."
CatboyInAMaidOutfit,"That was the most deliberate thumbing your nose at America that I can imagine someone in his position doing.  I hope he hangs himself with the compromises he made to get the job.  Someone will probably vote to impeach his ass the first week, and it won't be a democrat, it'll be one of the Republican hold outs."
mrarnold50,Cheeto dust all over his mouth
Jse034,There isn’t a more self serving sickening bunch of people on earth. McCarthy fits that group perfectly
Slappy_McWinkleson,"Fuck this POS and all the Republican legislators. They're anti-American trash. If you don't work for all the people, fuck off. I'm so sick of the right keeping us in the past and holding up progress. Buncha assholes along with anyone who supports them, including my own parents unfortunately."
Classic-End-5505,McCarthy couldn’t gape that bussy any wider for Trump
gustoreddit51,"The whole election denial gang of Gaetz, Bobert, Greene and other trump sycophants complicit in the coup attempt, dragging the House of Representatives around by the nose with so few members was infuriating and sickening."
ChaosKodiak,The GOP are so cult like.
Landolph,"I'm so tired of hearing from these ex-GOP idiots.  We get it, you have morals now.  Where were you when this shit was going down 5-10 years ago?  Getting your bag."
ooouroboros,"People are taking too much encouragement by GOP's seeming chaos - as if this somehow proves they are powerless to fuck up the government.

Believe me, these people are not harmless clowns, they are dangerous clowns. I imagine the only way Biden will get somethings done will be executive orders. but the House sill holds government spending hostage and there is not a lot that can be done about it."
BringOutYDead,Lick spittle boot licker licks boot. Go figure
hikermick,"Is it a coincidence that the media was swamped with coverage of the drama playing on in the House during the anniversary of the Jan 6th riots? A lot has surfaced thanks to the Jan6 committee. Even if not intentional you have to be sure the GOP is happy to be dodging it. Too busy voting, no time for interviews. Honestly I don't have cable news but not much Jan 6 coverage in the print media"
East1st,Speaker of the Ass Kissers
Educational_Permit38,McCarthy is pathetic and about to unleash havoc on the country and half of Americans are responsible for the hardships they will endure under his stupidity and narcissism. Sad day for America but kind of karmic too.
Primrus,"This is, without a doubt, the most disgusting thing I've ever seen. A room full of rich people cheering on their new masthead. It gives me shivers. This footage has captured horrific fascism, and half of my ugly country is celebrating it, despite the fact that they will all die by fascists' hands. I love you all and I really hope we somehow survive."
sandmann2022,Pretty much everything about this GOP is disgusting!
junk_politics,This spineless bootlicker is already working with the traitors in Congress to advance a pro Russian agenda.
Vakirka,"Which will last longer, McCarthy or the lettuce???"
Mister_Weiss,"The man, obviously, has no pride. The ultimate Republican “Cuck”."
Bigbert5,Disgusting it is . When McCarthy invites Trump to speak to the House will be even more disgusting before the “ State of the Union “ address by the President
Lucky_Wilkens,Kevin McCarthy is a miserable little suck ass. A person with a gram of personal integrity would be mortified to be in his current position. As it is he will not be Speaker of the House for long. The tide is coming back in and it’s loaded with hungry crabs. 🦀
Smrleda,Of course McCarthy MUST publicly thank Trump. As speaker McCarthy will continue to suck up to Trump. The fact that he was voted in is disgusting and indicates exactly where Republicans are. They did not have the courage to clean it up. McCarthy - the traitor to democracy that he is - should not be speaker.
Background-Gur-177,I believe that the 4 day ordeal was purposely set up by the Retrumplicans to take away from the J6 Anniversary
Rage-With-Me,Puke
CharToll,"He represents what every Californian outside of Bakersfield calls the asshole of the greatest state in the union… which if you haven’t picked up on it yet, is Bakersfield."

SJCCMusic,Sellout piece of shit
Sensitive_Policy_361,Reminds me of Mike Pence. Why do it hey do it?
AgentBlue62,"Must be one of the conditions Boebert or Gaetz insisted upon.

Humiliating him like a dog owner rubbing a dogs nose in it's own shit to housebreak it. (cruel dog owners)"
Robinhood4real," The freedumb caucus will always use these highly scrutinized moments to zing the left.  That's all that matters, to remind the rural Trump man that their boys in Washington are giving the commies one for."
Chevelle-72,Shows McCarthy is already a loser. We all knew had his ear.
mythofinadequecy,"Wipe your chin, kev"
strain_gauge,He said he was sure that the Russians paid Trump.  They have a recording of that.  Now he's sucking Trump's dick.
jcoffee77,Trump isn’t done destroying the GOP.
SilentNoivern,"As one of my uncle's just said... this is good... 
The Republicans and their voter base need to see the consequences of their actions for voting without making reflections and truly looking into what the person they are voting for is standing for.... which is nothing..."
risingsuncoc,McCarthy is a complete sellout
wretched-knave,"Disgusting comment, disgusting person."
Mayziec1962,Such a POS.
GullCove1955,The same fascists in the GOP that encouraged the attack on Democracy on Jan 6th attacked the House again 2 years later. McCarthy was left holding a gavel and little else. This does not bode well for this Party to make decisions for the Country. They can’t even work amongst themselves.
GTL_Reflex,Republicans are such cucks.
Necessary-Hat-128,"Absolutely disgusting! I am so sick of these revolting, criminal-supporting politicians! Our country is supposed to be the shining light of democracy for the rest of the world and the Republican Party is exactly the opposite of that!"
facehaver88,"So…. Are Americans ever going to do something about this like, I don’t know, say, vote for people that aren’t bootlickers?

Or is this just a further step into the shitty basement of the states showing how every step is worse than the last while never actually getting anywhere but fucked?"
Creepy-Poem9076,Funny how Gaetz changed his mind right after Harris literally threatened his life.
foxymoron,So rarely do they have the balls to say it while in office
guyfromthepicture,Why is it always an ex gop? This is so embarrassing
Krokodrillo,"He did thank ‚President Trump‘, Trump lost the election, which McCarthy denies. Congratulations to remove democracy."
No-Consideration6589,Donny is their Jesus.
BlueKing7642,"**Enables Trump’s election lies**

McCarthy: It’ll be different this time"
wowy-lied,The republican party is a treasonous organisation
RyantheAustralian,How many votes did he lose until he won?
pf9811,DJT doesn’t need toilet paper when he has McCarthy in his grip…. Such a weak low life
kestrel1000c,This had to be a crazy caucus concession. Kiss trumps ass and we make you speaker.
Farking_Bastage,Fucking groveling pussy kissed the ring.
CrisBkind18,Explain to me why the people who planned the overthrow of our government are still walking around free! Never mind the fact that some of them are still in office! Where is our justice department? Why have the not been charged?
joejustjoe120298,ABC had Sen Scott Perry (R) Pennsylvania on “thisweek” today. Why is a Fascist White Nationalist on television? He should be in a courtroom… with trump.
MoveItSpunkmire,Can’t support the GOP. They support domestic terrorism and protect domestic terrorists
Mysonsanass,"Not only is he a bootlicker, he is an obsequious bootlicker."
jcmatthews66,He still referred to him as “president“ trump. Pissed me off
A_Wild_VelociFaptor,"You fucking sissies were fleeing and hiding under desks, jesus christ."
DubBogey_425,Jesus fucking Christ. Get off your knees.
19Chris96,I would be too embarrassed and cringey to watch the video containing the altercation between McFarty and Gaetz.
imgroovy,What is it about politicians named McCarthy?
PipeMysterious3154,There is no shame
Awesome_Ray786,"Wasn’t needed, now he has to kiss the ring"
MidwestF1fanatic,The whole section of his speech about opening up “the people’s house” and verbiage in that section was pure low class. And on 1/6. Just a trash human with little regard for civility and truth. He went full MAGA in that speech. It was terrifying.
moodyblue8222,McCarthy sucking up to America’s mob boss! Typical republican behavior!
Macrosophy,"Even when Trump has been somewhat “incapacitated” he still took a knee.  Maybe to as not to alienate the MAGA constituents.

How will his life, career and speakership be seen in the annals of history."
baseballdnd,"Republicans, this is your party and what you voted for.  A completely useless brach of the government for the next two years. 

It will also be two years of great comedy sketches with these clowns"
StrangerAtaru,"McCarthy this week: We can't let the extremists run the party!

McCarhty today: Yep...the extremists were right, we are all the same.

Sicko."
GDPisnotsustainable,You get what you elect.  People=Shit
PM_ME_UR_RESPECT,I will never not be surprised at how quickly republicans became less than spineless when confronted with ***checks notes*** the compulsive lying game show host of Celebrity Apprentice.
LetterZee,Hypernormalizatokon folks
qwicksilver6,Grade A Assclown
ok-i-pull-up,Reminder that secret service had to carry this guy down stairs bc of his condition
Gnomojo,How many Mooches do you think he’ll last.
snewz404,"McCarthy said it last night, Hal Rogers is his mentor. This is Hal Rogers:

https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/07/hal-rogers-should-resign-over-election-vote-kentucky-democrats-say/6578975002/

These Kentucky reps are an interesting bunch."
SpiritRelative6410,Sycophants R Us.
coreywindom,I’m so tired of see people talking about Trump every time I get online.
Mesoposty,I’m sure that was part of the “get” to get the votes.
ThAllBlack,How come no one else could be voted in? I don’t get this process.
AceCombat9519,WHy would he do this in the first place? Truth is that McCarthy shouldn't be doing this due to Trump instigating the January 6th insurrection
omegajvn1,Can't take the cowardice out of cowards
AkilleuzsGaming,At this point this is the new normal 🤷🏽‍♂️
SoberDuffman,What a cuck
tp675,"The FBI is dragging their feet. Every day that goes by without indictments, emboldens extremists. The GOP is a sh*t show and it’s going to get worse until there’s accountability. Every parent that’s dealt with a misbehaving child knows this."
Jo-Jo-66-,"While the Republicans were trying to move away from the disaster of Trump , Kevin groveled to his master and elevated his standing just to gain the prized gavel. How many of the Republican donors are going to make him pay for that…we are in for two years of chaos."
newsilverlining,Get used to it. Those are his true colors.
Failure_man69,Watching the USA slowly go natc is actually insane.
nettiemaria7,I'm devoting the next ? years to trolling McCarthy as revenge for the horrible way Nancy Pelosi was treated.
Juvefish,McCarthy is so far up Trumps ass he needs to be surgically removed.
Rude-Strawberry-6360,You mean republicans are spineless cowards who put party over country every single chance they can?  I am shocked.  Heh.
stonge1302,Fucking clown
housemeat,i'd like to thank the guy who tried to overthrow the government and make the job i just fought so hard to get disappear in an ocean of fascist dictatorship.  god bless america.
fractal_pudding,all of the right-wing is disgusting. but it only establishes that they can't pass the developmental [mirror test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test).
druscarlet,Every thing about both of these individuals is disgusting.
CapPlanetNotAHero,"Bingo, he will be their nominee, no matter how much they try and distance themselves.

Ironically, their only hope for Trump not being the nominee is if he is prosecuted."
Lost_Minds_Think,How and why thw fuck are they still sucking Trump’s cock?
Immediate-Scale-8916,And the danger continues to grow unabated
Critical-Joke-597,Just trying to make Trump feel relevant. Trumps feeling get hurt so easily.
possoumous,"There's a lot ignorant folks in America to back these guys up, but they stand for nothing. I'm not a democrat but I stand for democracy. Trump stands for nothing except what will benefit him. His political usary will decimate the Republican Party until they recreate themselves. We need the Republican Party to exist as choice, but they have betrayed their core values for the vote of a deranged populous. Democracy is still strong but it's at a necessary phase where attention to it will make it stronger. I'll wager voter turnout is stronger in 2024 than 2020, which favors the middle class more than Republican or Democrat and should really be everybody's focus. Voter turnout is significantly correlated with income where the more money you make, the more likely you are to vote. When pleasing the rich is no longer a factor we finally solve the problems in America. The only reason the US doesn't have universal healthcare is because low voter turnout.
https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2020-10-30/these-countries-have-had-the-highest-voter-turnout
(Check the health care coverage of the countries with the highest turnout)

Trump in a way is an actual blessing because he has brought more interest to politics. My friend asked me in 2016 who I was voting for? I said Hilary because I'd like to a woman president but also if Trump wins it will bring a higher voting turnout because people will realize voting is actually important because we might incidentally elect a democratic antogonist (I was more thinking a moron at the time). The 2024 vote might make or break democracy, but I think it's really only going to break the Republican Party. Anybody that can and doesn't vote in 2024 is a fascist, knowingly or not and of course there will be those that vote for facism but they are not the majority. If facism takes hold voting no longer matters and greatest faction will win at great cost."
auberrypearl,I do not understand why there were so many votes
ECW-WCW-WWF,"Who cares. Nothing is going to be done about it anyways. We live in a world where they will keep getting away with everything. We will keep getting fucked by big corporations and billionaires. And we will do nothing about it as always. They will keep doing it because we are a pathetic, spineless, cowardice country. 

Unlike the people of Iran and Ukraine. Americans are full of fear when it comes to fighting for their rights and lives. 

Rinse and repeat. Nothing will ever change. We are pussies."
LegitGoodFun,"January 6th was a set up. Only truly stupid people were entrapped. Both parties are trapped in a cycle of fear, fund raising, hate and stupidity. Global corporations control both party's. Local government is the most honest and accountable. The partisans on Reddit and in DC are cartoon characters with little maturity and no strong principles. Biden and Trump are worthy of the same level of respect. Just as Schumer and McConnell or Pelosi and McCarthy.  Good manners and compromise are never disgusting. Hate is always blinding and unproductive."
bzhuman_earth,Nobody cares about the January 6th Capital disturbance.  We care about inflation.
jhick107,"I can’t keep up…..if Kev was Trump’s preference, does this mean the “Nev Kev” crew are all anti-MAGA? Flying in the face of Trumps wishes for 14 votes over 4 days would suggest this is the case but Gae-Boe are rabid MAGA….someone please make it make sense!"
Captain_CatDad,Isn’t he facing DOJ investigations for it anyhow?
ZegetaX1,What did he give up
turb077,Contrast that with his angry phone calls to him during the insurrection.  I wonder what Kevin is doing in the photos Trump has…  any guesses???
SpecterOfGuillotines,"McCarthy helped Trump with his vote against certifying during the initial January 6 insurrection.

Thanking Trump is a lot less objectionable than the literal treason they did together."
FoxRaptix,"Not surprising, one of his concessions to get the speakership was to allow trumps Allie’s to interfere with the *ongoing* federal investigations in to him.  Same thing they did with the mueller investigation, where they used their congressional authority to sneak trump details the investigators had."
Melodic_Ad_6870,"After McCarthy thanked, trump just gave me reason to NEVER trust him (McCarthy)!!!  2 years of chaos  are coming!"
spacegiantsrock,I wonder if that was one of his concessions to the psychos.

BecauseBassoon,Can’t get the stink off.
Zeronaut81,"What. An. Embarrassment. Spineless, feckless, coward."
Pieceman11,"You’ve got to worry about the ones that will do anything to secure power for themselves. No moral compass leading the way, no principals, just a lustful obsession for power at any cost."
nooksak,He was forced
hackingdreams,Welcome to the next two years of your life folks. McCarthyism 2.0.
a-really-cool-potato,"So, he just made himself ineligible to act as a member of Congress then?"
my_name_is_24601,I’m old enough to remember when you had a speaker election NIGHT not week. Clearly massive voter fraud. /s
g2g079,Trump's Congressional endorsements took just enough power away from the House GOP that they needed him to get a tiny bit of it back.
CatAvailable3953,"I have no idea where this post will end on the stream. You would have a difficult time writing a script to begin the end of Republican control 
in both houses of congress. 
This is a performance directed at their base. But why? They won’t accomplish much if anything until the debt limit. 
If they ruin the government’s good faith and credit I cannot imagine a good outcome. As for taking Social Security and Medicare (not to mention military retirement benefits) and putting them under discretionary spending seems a recipe for defunding. As would a combination of voluntary contributions. 
Voters need to get up to speed."
kljfahu,"Great, so Biden impeachment (for reasons) in 5 4 3...."
findingmike,So just convince the Trump lovers that the GOP is dissing Trump and the GOP won't be able to pass legislation?
michael_polk,Repeat
theblackbeltsurfer,McCarthy is spineless
No-Beat-263,Two years to late
ChemicalObjective216,Explain to me like I am 5. Why didn’t the vote end the first time when Jeffries had the most votes for speaker?  If you can nominate anyone for this position what is the point of having an election until you get the results one guy wanted?
Hartache14,"One of traitor Trump's loyal suckbutts would like to thank traitor Trump - for helping traitor Kevin McC. secure enough treasonous votes to ensure a cowardly, lying traitor is now Speaker of the House, thereby allowing for more treasonous activity to flourish at the highest levels of our government. Trump's stench continues to permeate every level of our governing bodies."
Pitiful_Computer6586,Jan 6 lol
redditwb,The real question is who will replaced McCarthy when he gets indicted in April.
devo00,There will be nonstop no-confidence votes as soon as the house reconvenes…
Roadglide114-,"The question that I haven’t heard being asked throughout this whole thing, is why does he want the speakership so badly? and after raising $500+ million for the RP who is he indebted to? How many deals have he made to donors we no nothing is free. So who is he/ republicans working for really?"
Turbulent_Cricket497,"Total noob to this sub so sorry in advance if this is a dumb question.  It is my understanding that McCarthy had to make lots of concessions/agreements with the holdouts to get their votes.  So my question is, what happens if he reneges on what he promised?  I mean he agreed under severe duress.  Are there meaningful repercussions?"
