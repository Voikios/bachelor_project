aviwashere,"I was on reserve one time and I heard a scav call-out followed by voip asking if I was a scav. I told the guy no but that I was willing to take the pmc scav extract with him. We came face to face and he told me that he was new and needed some stuff for his hideout. While I‚Äôm talking to this guy, another scav chimes in from outside the building we were in and I offered him to join us. While I‚Äôm talking to the guy outside, the scav next to me shoots me in the arm and out of pure instinct, I blasted the poor bugger and I immediately realized that I fucked up. The guy was in his fucking inventory and accidentally miss clicked as he was coming back to game. I heard him yell ‚ÄúNO WAIT‚Äù as he died :( 

I still feel bad about it lol. Sorry, dude."
killjoySG,"I was in Factory once to kill USEC players, and I came up on a Japanese guy at forklift spawn. I shot him up, but he pulled out his knife and pleaded with me to spare him. Turns out, he was doing an optional task of extracting via medtent, but accidentally brought his stash backpack with him.

I didn't trust him at first, but he was really heavy for a guy wearing paca armor, his backpack was huge and he kept cowering at every gunshot. I led the way to medtent, and it turned out he didn't have the key. He was also bleeding out, thanks to me, so I gave him my salewa and brought him to the only other extract I knew, Gate 3.

It was a shit show, I caught a grenade to the legs and got pinned. I showed my guy where the exit was before I died, and the Japanese guy actually made it out. We became friends after that, and he even reached lvl 40 before me. We still chat sometimes.

*Edit: Didn't know the word Jap was a slur, so I changed them all to Japanese"
Tap1oka,"i only felt bad the time I saw someone with the USEC baseball cap, m4 standard, commando rig, WATER BOTTLE AND FOOD in factory. thoughts and prayers to timmy."
IEatLotsOfButter,I always kill Timmys in hopes they quit the game so they can live a better life than me
rexhunter99,"I was stuck doing Golden Zibbo for two days and my lower skill friends gave up because we kept getting blasted by higher level people with flea market with MP7s and meta AKs an M4s lasering us to death, the few times I get a chance to VOIP to them that we have nothing and just want to plant the zibbo, they either lie about being friendly then kill us or just ignore us and pub stomp us.  
I've been playing since Alpha so I know how to just push through the cancer but my friends work weird shift jobs and dont get the most time to try the game, they can sink in a few hours a day but that's not enough to just brute force through the meta abusers."
Jackpkmn,Instead of tasking alone i'll go on the tarkov discord and invite low levels to my group and just accompany them while i do my tasks. I don't need their help but they make good company and it seems to lift their spirits.
TheCrusadingVulture,"I found people brand new to the game as a player scav today, I took them under my wing as a pscav as well. Showed them some customs stashes and then led them to extract and added them. I'm not the best player 850hrs and only lvl 29 this wipe. But I feel like I can do some teaching and don't mind. It wouldn't have happened though if they didn't accidentally que into a night raid lmao"
TTVytFacebookGaming,"Killed 2 level 2's as a scav and felt genuinely terrible. Messaged them after to offer help, but I feel like the damage was already done üòÇ"
CanadianBear67,One tapped a lvl 4 pmc with a kolpak in dorms today with igolnik.
DIMEBAGLoL,First wipe with voip was goated because most people were friendly and you could do fun shit. Now it‚Äôs rare to hear anyone mic‚Äôd up
Hoyle_38,"I work 50 hrs a week and I had to stop playing Tarkov. I get home, play for 2 - 3hrs and I spent more time getting murdered than progressing in the game. Sucks because I love this game...Tarkov isn't meant for someone like me who can only put in 15hrs a week."
TotalChaos21,The worst is when you try to voip and they don't talk back. Not knowing if they even heard your offering of peaceful passage or not.
ImaginaryAI,"Tone down the recoil and new players will be able to get headshots with shit ammo

Aiming ability has always been the great equalizer in shooter games"
Ok_Shop_3418,I just quit playing all together. I don't have the time to dedicate to the game and I suck at it being blind in one eye and having bad eyesight in general. People just steam roll me if I ever try lol
BananaHas2Ns,"Oh man! I felt so bad today. Spawned on woods near used camp. Was taking a peek at the camp and heard someone get hit by the land mines. Not once but twice.

After the second one he comes running around and runs face first into my m855a1. 

Check dog tags and he‚Äôs lvl 2 running Scav guns/gear and comtecs. Felt so bad but still took his comtecs"
Faesarn,"I was on streets doing quests with a friend. We fought with some guys and decided it's not worth it, so we escaped and took a detour. On the way, the door 3meters away from me opened and a Timmy with a pistol got out, I killed him and the guy that followed him outside.. both lvl 1 and had food on them.. I felt bad."
BoaterSnips,Everyone I‚Äôve met that plays this game is either toxic af or just gate keeps. Maybe it‚Äôs just the servers I‚Äôve joined but holy fuck I just wanna learn man.
resfan,"Well, they took away control from the fresh account and locked everything behind grind fest stats and Gucci accessory parts that add another 36lb's to your intermediate caliber rifle so it's somehow barely controllable on burst fire as a trained PMC making new players go ""what the actual shit is the point in half these weapons I'll just use a shotgun or bolt action"" while GigachadMc'Gee playing 389 hours a week comes flying by to melt you with his meta gun, armor, and stims eating everything you send at his face because he has a ballistic shield rated for pistol rounds that spawns a black hole eating everything sent its direction, I'd say it's pretty unfriendly to new players as well."
negrocrazy,60 bs to kill a scav ? Who's the timmy in this story?
Hunk-Hogan,"I'll be coming into this wipe pretty late due to major PC issues and my buddy's PC is also down so when I start up mid-wipe, I'm going to cosplay as a Timmy to see how many people will help escort me around the map. After 5 or so years, the grind isn't as fun as it used to be so I'm going to be switching things up this time. 

I'm going to go pro-Timmy with VOIP. I'll be bringing in extra food/water and spare bullets every single raid so at least if someone just outright kills me, they might feel bad when they check all the extra stuff I brought in. I'm thinking spare SKS mags loaded with .366 mixed in will be fun as well."
fpsgamer2,"Good to have empathy, but as a timmy if I kill you I will start screaming and I will loot even your balaclava if I can."
Frillin,It's trying to learn the maps for me. Can't find extractions to save my life...literally.
EngineeringOk6839,I just killed a lvl 4 and I felt so bad
Hekto177,Me and the boys always pour one out for the Timmy's that cross our path.  RIP.
Lil_Giraffe_King,"When I‚Äôm mowing through the factory lobbies with my flechette, it‚Äôs hurts a little when I find a level 1"
Turbulent-Elephant77,"I had a naked PMC say ""don't kill me please, I need to do delivery from the past"" so I told him follow me and lead him to the offices in order to *help* him. Needless to say I got friend from the west and secured perimeter done.

God save flechette."
Roymetheus,"On a previous wipe I killed a couple of guys that brought in their gift items, NVGs, thick loot, and modded guns.

I was wearing a bank robber and using a shotgun with Maggy Buck.  No armor, no helmet, just trying to get a couple of quests done.  I heard them and assumed they were Scavs. I shot at them and they ran into a store.  I shot them in their legs as they laid prone in the furniture store on Interchange.  They had no idea what was happening.

When I went to loot I saw they were level 2 and 3.  So I ditched the bulk of their stuff, hoping they had insured it.

I added them both and tried to see if they needed help or wanted to play together. Added one on discord and struck up a really good conversation.  But the one I talked with uttered some sad words, ""u literally made us uninstall. we were fully geared and u just pumped us in the face xD""

I was that guy to them and it felt icky.  They also didn't insure anything.

Unfortunately, it didn't stop me from murdering more of the Timmy kind in other raids.

BSG made me the monster I am.  I've accepted it."
Lots_of_schooners,The brutality of tarkov is its appeal. If it was easy it would be boring
biteater,Crazy how it‚Äôs still January and the wipe is basically ‚Äúover‚Äù. Game is mostly about speedrunning now
evilomerta,"I only feel bad for the new players who are trying to play legit. Last week I killed 3 level 6s who were RMT buyers. All 3 had rys-t, m995, and hex grids‚Ä¶ at level 6‚Ä¶ I killed em all with nades and extracted with their loot only to realize they had that gear at level 6. it‚Äôs obvious they bought the game to not even give a chance but to just to cheat."
whered,"I'm a new player (level 10, first wipe) and this game is so hard. I feel so lost in every map it's terrible lmao. But I'm still having fun, with the occasional ''okay'' raids."
Baconmazing,"Anyone under level 7 gets all their stuff ditched if I kill them. As quickly and safely as possible, with no regard for hiding efficiency."
98thSpartan,"Yeah, I honestly feel bad too when I kill a new player. But that was me last wipe, and now this wipe I‚Äôm actually getting the hang of the game so if they stick around, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll get the hang of it, too. Although this game makes me wanna quit every day, I keep coming back for more lol."
skychasezone,"I never feel bad for killing player scavs. Half of them are always in groups and they're just there to grief because they didn't bring in their own gear.

I feel bad for killing low level PMCs on customs though."
Krempiz,I think Tarkov has to transition into a form matchmaking system at least to protect the lvl 1 to 15 players. This seems to get worse later in the wipe
Tedthebar,"As a new player, this game is probably the most non toxic fps game I ever played. As soon as I VoIP, people seem to want to chat or allow me to live instead of killing me lol"
XxSolo-GeneralxX,"I‚Äôm new to Tarkov (like 5 raids) and PC gaming in general. The bar of entry is extremely high. 3 scav runs and 2 pmc runs I‚Äôve been head/eyesed EVERY SINGLE TIME and I‚Äôve not actually seen any of the people shooting me. I‚Äôm the dope for one trying to get the hang of keybinds in the first place. I spent a whole lot of money to get into this. EoD edition, curved 1440 monitor, built a pc myself with a 1660 super which surprisingly holds up well in the modern era because I broke the budget, chair, desk, the whole damned thing. Maybe this isn‚Äôt the game to get into learning MnKeyboard but saw streams of this game and was obsessed. I‚Äôm absolutely heartbroken at how much of my starting gear I‚Äôve lost. I know there‚Äôs a way to just wipe yourself and start over but I‚Äôll get it eventually. 
Felt good to rant and admit what a blueberry I am. 20 years on a controller and I fire Tarkov up and feel like a toddler on Atari again. Just frustrating"
bobobo_bobo_bo,"Hi! I'm a new player. Just started playing a few weeks ago. Let me tell you about my experience.

The new player experience in this game is genuinely some of the smelliest garbage I have ever experienced in a game. I have never felt like the developers were trying so hard to get me to stop playing.

I'm all for a game that doesn't hold your hand, is very challenging, and has a very steep learning curve, but Tarkov takes these things to such an insane degree, and it doesn't make sense to me.

What value is gained by requiring your new players to suffer for 20+ hours before they can even begin to hope to stand a chance against most other players?

What value would be lost by easing that experience a bit?

What value is added to the Tarkov experience by requiring me to spend more time in Google and Youtube than actually playing the game, just to understand things as basic as buying guns, or equipping attachments to those guns?

What value is added by having literally zero indication on where to actually find your extracts, or what conditions those extracts have?

Excluding the new player experience, Tarkov is a very cool game and I like it a lot. But I haven't even hit level 15 yet and I don't know if I care enough to push much further. At every turn, it has felt like the developers are pushing me over, kicking me while I'm down, and laughing. 

What value does this bring to the overall game experience of Tarkov?

Obviously there is a community of passionate players who have brute-forced their way past all this crap, and deep down I feel like I would enjoy this game a lot if I could make it through myself. 

But I'm almost 30. I work a full time job, and do my best to maintain a healthy social life, as well as take care of my physical and mental health. I can only play like 2 hours a night, some nights.

Who is this game for? Teenagers on summer break, adults without family, and full-time streamers?

What value would be lost by condensing the ladder that new players all have to climb down to a tight 5 or 6 hours, and then set them loose? Even 5 or 6 hours would be a lot. When you take into account how much time I need to spend Googling and watching YT videos, it'll probably be 40-50 hours before I'm not stuck in this trash fire. What value is added to Tarkov by this?

Why?

Maybe it's just not for me."
PlutoJones42,You‚Äôve become what you hated most.  A Chad.
plagueapple,"I allways feel so bad. Today a one tapped a level 5 who was snekaing to gate 3 as a player scav.
He had a lot of good loot"
Superdude1437,"I mean the worst part is once again the ammo changes power creep as we start to reach mid wipe.

7.62 PS on an SKS and AKs gave new players a ""fair"" fighting chance against most geared level 15+ players.

Now you that you have to literally use a slot on the secure container to secure those bullets from AI scavs is just another kick in the balls for non EOD owners.

Any player below level 15 will be stuck on either Shotguns or PPSHs this wipe, making them pretty much free kills on medium and long ranges.

Let alone the fact that none of their gear is worthwhile to loot from veteran players.

Makes you wonder if Tarkov should have a ""gear score"" system added so that if you load in fully geared as a PMC you will almost always face geared players, while also avoiding running over timmys using ultra budget loadouts that are worth less than a half magazine of M80 bullets."
sashisashih,"when my friend got sniped at woods i legged it and knew they were on me as supressed shots kept pinging, so i  kept running n running. finally made it beyond their reach and figured to extract so my friend can get back into the raid, and make my way to usec camp for cover; saw what seemed to be a scav stand in the open so i unload my mp7 and he goes down, i discord my friend that that was a weird place for a scav and then turn around the rock and two pmcs just sat there and looked at me; 
anyways, i started blasting and a minute later theyre both down and i check my health n armor; almost not a dink and just a broken arm. then the realization sinks in‚Ä¶they were all newbies; one lvl 2 with just an sks(the ‚Äúscav‚Äù) and two lvl 6s in their beginner gear w m4s and m855‚Ä¶ i wrote them post raid w apoligies and a promise i hadnt looted them, but just got a confused ‚Äúwhat‚Äù back and they didnt lvl since‚Ä¶"
ordinarymagician_,"God last night there was a timmy who was trying to do search mission that ran up on me after a rat killed my partner and I was done looting, said I'M DOING SEARCH MISSION I JUST HAVE A PISTOL. Told him to put his gun away.

I hid his stuff."
S3HN5UCHT,That was me w my fir flash drive 45k roubles and a lucky airdrop as I spawned in and about to go exit to finish flash quest w90 secs left in scav run and pmc happens to be there and lights me tf up
tonytactica1,"I‚Äôve hit a point where I feel guilty killing players. 

I killed a level 4 the other day with 2 gas analyzers in his bag and logged out for the night. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs VOIP or what but PVP has lost its draw for me."
PulledPorkPlease,"What is old tarky? The place where you kill without hearing the Timmy screaming why? Lol 

I feel ya though. It definitely weighs on the conscious less when I can‚Äôt hear them yell as they die."
throwmeinthecanal,"‚ÄúWait, before you kill me‚Äù üí•"
ZakeZapente,Okay I feel like this is a universal experience this wipe. Every time I kill someone and see an MRE and Water brought into raid I feel so bad
Lightly__Salted,"Remember rushing a guy in Factory who was running an M4 early wipe, unloaded into him with an UMP only to realise after it was a level 1 who brought a whole kit in... Paca, peen helm, M4 and even water and an iskra in his backpack..."
Puntenel,Let's face it: it has always been like this
Gloomy-Range4017,Dont feel bad i like getting killed
Blacksix_Azuraai,"One time i was at Woods, hunting down scavs for the Prapor quest. So i went to Military Camp and i met with like 4 timmys there. I kinda want to shoot them, then i saw all of them only have their knives. So i voice chat them first, only one of them answer.He told me he was new to the game and this is his second PMC raid. 

He doesn't know where the extract is. So i decide to help them by showing where the extract is (Outskirt). He was kinda in disbelief since he thought all players in the game are hostile and thanked me for helping him.

When we came out from the camp, some guy started full auto on us. 2 timmies died, while another shouted ""Don't shoot!"". The hostile PMC shouted back ""No no, you die"" in chinese slag. I opened fire on him back, trying to protect the timmies and managed to kill him.But i kinda too late to save all 4 timmies. 

I felt really bad i couldnt helped them. But at least i got their dogtags to remember by (Yeah, they all level 1)..."
Trantarx,I am a new player and I love that the game is so unforgiving. That's why I play it.
XMicroHeroX,"I feel like it's even worse in Europe because VOIP is rarely used, no point when everyone speak different languages"
Abject_Bodybuilder_7,I am new for the last 3 years
IrregularrAF,All I feel is recoil.
PckMan,"I like how people make friends from time to time but nowadays most people acting friendly and ""just doing a quest"" shoot you in the back of the head the moment you turn around so this has pretty much ruined VOIP for me."
Z0EBZ,"I'm terrrible, maybe it's because I got bullied, dad left, or I'm just plain ugly, but I enjoy being a jerk. Scavving on streets doing a food run to try and get a FIR sausig for the local crackhead Jaeger on his ""quest"".

He did say earlier that he found a tank battery and was going to leave... and I have all the OFZ shells, and have never gotten an FIR tank battery. He carried it all the way to the door, 30 feet, to extraction. I mowed him down with my Kedr B in the back of the head and took the tank battery. I completed polikhim hobo quest, and regulated materials in a clean sweep. I had hit all the crates, most of the food spots, and some juicy loot could make the dopamine that I've been lacking, make me happy. I ask if there is any sausig and he says there is! Very nice, very good. As much as my traitor radar is going off, I really don't care, either I get no sausig or I do. He started walking off and dropped a nixxor lens which I very much appreciated, and I looted the rest of the box, pilgrim, and some other goodies I can't remember fully. After a minute I leave and luckily we are right at the extract Entrance to catacombs. He is walking...very slowly.

mzoltek,"As a level 9 noob playing his first wipe, I expect to die every single time I see someone anymore, even scavs‚Ä¶ kill me and don‚Äôt feel bad üòÅ"
CptFruitBear,Atleast you tried. I just bought the game a week ago and I'm getting shit on everytime I turn around. Most of the time I'll be running and bam I'm dead didn't even see them. If I actually do see them it's like their gun has no recoil while mines all over the place. Oh look a level 37 just killed me while I'm level 8.
QueenAnneRevennge,"I have +4k hours. In 2019, I would hit level 40 in under a week and I would get kappa in like 2-3 months. 

I struggle so incredibly hard each wipe nowadays and it only gets harder. I have absolutely no clue how new players do it if experienced veterans like myself are hardcore struggling. Veritas is hardcore struggling too the same way I am and he's a streamer... Nobody is safe."
jrocAD,"Agree - there are soo many ways this could be handled.  Like maybe the first 5 levels can be done PVE only (if you want).  Or restructure the missions to have a more level progression, instead of easy missions easy mission, SUPER FUCKING HARD MISSION.

&#x200B;

Also, I think everyone should have a little difference in the order of the missions, so for example early wipe, we don't have EVERYONE going to customs for the pocket watch at the same time.  That's just bullshit imho.  Every wipe, I try to hit that mission like in the first few days before everyone else, otherwise it's impossible.  I always get that one done quick, then i go back with my buddy weeks later and it's like impossible."
belac206,"I had a low level pmc on factory beg for mercy, but mercy doesn't get stirrup completed. So i shot him about a dozen times with 9mm while he screamed NO DON'T SHOOT ME PLZ. 10/10 realism."
jloll1,"All of the changes they‚Äôve made as far as ammo or armor or whatever sound good on paper, but they aren‚Äôt. I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúthis actually benefits casual players because the grinder chads won‚Äôt have access to it‚Äù but they do. All of these changes and I still am getting killed by 762bp and m62 in most of my raids and it‚Äôs still early. You can say it benefits casual players, but it just straight up fucking doesn‚Äôt. Chads still have the shit obviously. I‚Äôm done with it."
TheChurn5E,Lvl 15 and below players should not be in the same lobby as 16 and up.
ADHDguys,"I think it‚Äôs hilarious that this post is centered around ‚Äúnew players‚Äù and the only people complaining in it are veterans. I‚Äôm a new player and this game is fun as fuck and I‚Äôm progressing just fine. Which is the exact sentiment I‚Äôve gotten from other new players. But hey, we don‚Äôt have enough hours to be allowed an opinion, even when it‚Äôs literally about our experience."
threwasausernamehere,Their screams of pain fill me with joy as I'm reminded of the misery I once suffered at the hands of those who are now me.
BedFordEgremont,"not really a new player story always hard to tell if they are or not, but was in 2 storey dorms looting when I heard someone w keying down the hall way I pop out and unload, pop back in and this dude just starts begging about needing to do a quest, my mic was unplugged so I couldn't reply, he sounded so freaking desperate about it too, I give a little peak and I see he's usec ..... Im on friend from the west part 1. I killed him  


Im sorry brotha, I've never felt so bad after killing someone, that guy sounded like I sound when I've been trying to get something done so many times and you start losing it."
brokensword15,"I got blasted so many times as a noob, I feel nothing anymore.

&#x200B;

No mercy"
Isac1995,The game has always been hard for new-comers. It‚Äôs part of it
Shadowraiden,"ill say it. old tarkov was worse for new players.

also you tried to communicate and he didnt respond thats on him. has nothing to do with the game you gave him a big chance to respond.

i remember when you would be locked on some quests as a new player for weeks because the places they were would be camped by chads for easy kills."
vectorseven,"I voiped some guy I was just in to get some matches. Told me I was going to FN die. So as I die he says, ‚Äúsorry.‚Äù What‚Äôs the point of making everyone play together of different levels?"
Comfortable_Power108,If it makes you feel better I linked up w a lvl 2 Timmy today and gave him sorely needed stash advice lol
GhostFyreHD,They have to learn the hardway that tarkov is not a fun game
Screamin_Toast,I feel nothing killing timmy. It's a lesson. A lesson he had to learn.
mikek1993,Game is far more friendly now than it ever has been to new players. The old game didn't have walk throughs and tutorials for every task with levels of indepth explanation on armor and ammo. There was no ingame communication so everyone was hostile. You used to be unable to repair limbs so you lose a limb you have to use PKs so better stay stacked with them and if you lost your stomach better have some milk on hand. The game is much more new player than it ever has been.
variabletimingtimmy,I dunno maybe I'm retarded but when I started 2 wipes ago I was getting smacked so hard that every time I spawned PMC on customs(only map I played) I died within 30 seconds. I for whatever reason spawned in front of old gas 9/10 times and I'd get wiped before I made it to the warehouses on the other side of the bridge. I loved it. But maybe because I had zero expectations about the game other than it being a hardcore loot/shooter with permanent gear loss. I haven't been on much this wipe or last (2 kids under 2) I know I won't make it past level 15 before it wipes again. I don't care I have fun and I always get a good laugh when I pop some level 30 + with an SKS with shit ammo or a well-timed grenade throw. I really don't care about high-tear gear or even making it out with good loot lol as long as I make enough to buy ears and a gun I'm good. Hell I don't even bother insuring my gear cause I can't commit to making it back on in 2 -3 days
Matiasfrodr95,"i am new and i love the game but i never had any positive encounters with other pmc or player scavs, they are all aggressive so i took it for granted that i will never trust anybody. I am just learning the maps this wipe going slowly, using my scav the most. Its kinda crazy that there is no sort of tutorial, like even some text prompts or interact buttons to know the controls, because even watching youtube videos there is so much that isnt said or said well, this is by far the most harsh to new player game i ve ever played on my life and i come from hunt showdown and rust"
Hippo_Steak_Enjoyer,I always try and talk to people. They always kill me. I want to play this game so bad. But its so fucking disheartening getting killed everytime you try and talk. Might as well play ~singleplayer~.
Cho0coCheese,Old tarky? When everyone was killing scavs mindlessly and anyone that gave themselves off as a player scav would get the iron
JanterFixx,"Was is customs . As a new player scared myself and having no map knowledge.

Saw someone running into the wagon near zb12 exit. I shot him mosin and he was in the wagon in my sights and I had a clear shot. But he pleased over comms please don't kill me I'm doing a mission
I didn't kill him, he was going for crossroads extraction and I was going to accompany him..
When we were almost past old has station shots started to fire at us. I heard him say ""oh fuck"" and next moment he drops down and shots near us. I ran backwards and hid for 10 minutes."
Eweasy,"I feel bad but since last wipe I‚Äôm on my bully arc, being mean to Timmy is my favorite pastime"
C_Forde,Old tarky? Do you think the game was easier in new players back then? Because it wasn‚Äôt
luciferr92,"I always said, gotta get fucked to start the fucking on tarkov. If it was more beginner friendly the whole cod community would of migrated here by now. I bet you that guy is now determined to do the things u did to him to other people. This game Lowkey build a fire in us by that happening to us. He will be back"
Rob_Rams,Yeap thst could been me I've had these experience as a scav and a pmc 9 literally tell them dude you are spending more shooting me than what I have lets work togheter please Noooooo but they always kill me mid sentence so now i just shoot anyone on sight lmao this games teachs you quick.
WhyAmIEvenHereJesus,"Nah u tried to talk to them and they refused, obviously they knew how to use voip. It was on their hands at that point"
Epicloa,I love that you think this is a new issue lol
Dapaaads,That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always been. Hasnt stopped from growing. It kicks casuals out quick
Matto_boi,Last week i met a timmy shouting to not shoot at him while spam firing sks at me
cth777,"Speaking of which. Is there a good way to find other players who are pretty bad to team up with? This is the second wipe I‚Äôve played some tarkov andnim level 10 but just don‚Äôt play any other mouse and keyboard games lol, controller games otherwise"
JiffTheJester,60 rounds of BS? Seems excessive lol
game-tapes808,I just started 2 weeks ago & already really gettin the hang of things. Helps to do some offline raids / watch videos before attempting real raids. Really enjoyin the real raids/ game üëå

glumbum2,I dont think bsg wants new players
Logan_Thackeray2,thats the game. i wasnt shown mercy when i dove head first into factory my first time. no voip then either
SugarInTea1203,Why not be friendly then‚Ä¶
rudoku18,"Was just telling my brother this, he just started a wipe or two ago. And mostly just scav runs and builds a godly chad stash from that, but never runs pmc unless he has people on to help him quest as hes kinda bad but tbh gettin better. I started in .9, when servers were dead, and maps smaller with walls not landmines. And quests were less, so ive done a slowly gettibg bigger list, where hes just had the whole big list. Like i rushed healthcare pt5 for medcase where he was jjst 2 quests away and about to buy one cause he needed room. Was like hell nah we go woods, then str8 to factory and got him his case. And on woods, i voiped a pistoler no doubt a low lvl doin his quests and negotiated both groups survival at zb014, and we didnt meet another pmc rest of raid (night time best time). My brother bas me, and my group, but theres tons of timmys out there and i just feel bad killin em"
theeBrute,"I used to give timmies the chance to run, then stopped because they never did."
DarthSkath,This game is extremely unfriendly why I‚Äôve slowed down on playing it
Rohrkrepierer,"Nope. Welcome to Tarkov, Billy!"
lazy_elfs,Just killed my first 2 pmc trying to get out with some shit i didnt mean to bring in my bag‚Ä¶ im a scav guy who was running a shity load out but left a night vision rifle in my bag. 13 and a 16.. with a shotty with cheap slugs. Then a crappy ak with the kick of a mule‚Ä¶ thankfully they sucked as well.. got out with a adar and my night vision rifle
tzc005,"Was the game ever forgiving to new players, though? I was lucky enough to have some vets teach me the game. By the time they stopped playing, I had a regular group to run with. That, combined with my need to know more/look stuff on the wiki eventually gave me the leg up."
Whole_Ad5154,I went through customs merking all the scavs I could for polkheim hobo and started heading to extract. At ruaf I heard some one and just pushed with my light and laser on. Looked over and pointfired at a guy dropping him pretty quick. Looted his tag and saw level 6 I felt so bad. Bro was just tryna extract.
Motampd,"As a new, shitty player - I honestly feel bad about killing other low levels. 

I know how hard it is to figure out and how much time it takes to even get the very basics worked out. I feel really bad when I kill someone that is low level. IDK I almost feel like its doing a disservice to new players....Like I dont want new people to give up and quit because they cant even ""get started"".

I have messaged a handful of the few PMC kills I have just to apologize. I also don't take the majority of their shit unless it really is a major upgrade from my own current gear.. I don't want to take the gun you spent days trying to afford - just so I can sell it for a few extra bucks to a trader."
BenoNZ,Killed a lvl 2 with 7 min left on Shoreline when I was doing a chill scav run. Poor dude saw me and thought I didn't notice them. One tapped their head. Tried to add them to say sorry but they didn't accept..
xXZombeastXx,"As much as it‚Äôs sucks and that we‚Äôve all been there, they gotta learn somehow"
1980mazda,I literally only came on this group to see if i was the only one who gave up on the game first day
CrucialLinks,"The worst is when you kill them, and they‚Äôve got their entire stash in their backpack, and they brought two MRE‚Äôs and both waters, like they‚Äôre getting ready for a camping trip. üòÇ poor guys. Tarkov is so rough to start. Whenever I was new I just used pistols only but I never knew what was worth anything, having helped a lot of my friends get started that‚Äôs the biggest hill is realizing what‚Äôs worth inventory space and you‚Äôre time."
Rush_0MG,"I had a game last night with two Mates, all running mosins for fun. Came across a guy who was looking the other way and all three of us unloaded on him at the same time, dropped him and checked tags - level 2. 

The poor dude must have felt like he was a victim of a firing squad."
Illtakeboffum,I didn‚Äôt know there was discord when I started playing. I died solo or died trying to matchmake in lobby. It‚Äôs friendlier than ever
Sebulous,Idk I enjoyed that as part of the experience when I was a noob. I thought it was very satisfying vsing space troopers even if I lost.
Mint_Fury,"I am far from a new player, pushing about 1800 hours. This wipe has been hard. I have been having a bitch of a time finding quest items and keys. I've been doing tons of jacket runs and checking my filing cabinets but haven't found anything. Definitely glad I'm not new jumping into this game these days."
Valuable-Article-843,"I blast them, no mercy."
buttsu556,old tarkov was less friendly....i started playing mid wipe when flea market wasnt in the game yet. the changes they made were good changes except for .45 ap and m80 should be peace keeper 3 and less expensive along with 9mm 6.3 ap. biggest issue rn is streets optimization and sound and weapon/weapon mods balance. everything else is fine.
Complex-Ad237,"I had a player scav approach me while I was scaving at usec camp on woods. I‚Äôve just filled up my bags and had an SVD. I voip give him the wiggle. He stops, looks at my svd, looks at me, raises that shitty 366 with a pistol grip and no dust cover. Gotta tell you, glad he only hit my arm bc I mag dumped that evil scav. Had to limp all the way to scav bunker but thanks for the rep guy."
Kushkaki,Lol I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs how old tarky was too. When I first started playing a few wipes ago it was deep into a wipe and I shit you not almost every person who‚Äôs kill me would add me and say they didn‚Äôt loot my stuff I‚Äôll get it back in insurance and if I‚Äôm new they‚Äôd help me out lol. I almost didn‚Äôt want to level up because of it haha
deathzombie15,"Typically don‚Äôt take anything from anyone level 5 and under unless they‚Äôre clearly veterans, I‚Äôll even ditch the timmys guns in bushes sometimes in hopes they insured everything, it just feels so bad when you kill a guy just to realize he‚Äôs level 2 and was practically harmless"
zaminer,"I like the idea of playing solo only. Being alone in that world feels scary and serious and cool. I'm on about 4 wipes now, but I'm stopping Tarkov now. It's simply un-fun now. The significance of losing gear is so high now that you're less inclined to even engage a fight. Rather just run away. I found 27 BP bullets for a broken scav AKM I found, dumped those into a player, and then followed up with those t45 rounds and it bounced off the player like nerf bullets. Still got single-shot even though I've scrounged up some level 4 armour. Now that's gone I'm back to level 3 armour and I can't even buy an AK or EVEN PS ammo... Which was the worst crappest ammo last year!
It's not worth engaging fights because they feel so random and not skill-related... The laggy netcode means you can feel like you're playing ok but they'll just pop you with one bullet to the eyes after you've given them 40 to the chest.
Oh and since you're alone and you don't know if you're dealing with a 2man, a 3man, a 4man, a 5man, a who knows how-many-man, it's pointless. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Bottom line, it used to feel fun but it really doesn't anymore, and knowing in 6 months my progress will be gone anyway makes it feel really stupid to grind so hard to do yet.again.the.same.boring.quests. nah. Insanity.
ü´°"
Apollord,"I killed a level 1 on factory earlier and it broke my heart, the guy had clearly sat down and put alot of careful thought into his loadout. As if his wife had laid it out for him the night before, he had a paca, commando rig, m4 with mags, some food and water in his bag, one med for each type strategically placed and some spare bullets in case he needed to raid long into the night. I found him openly looting the first box available to him without a care in the world. He lasted 48 seconds in this world. Genuinely felt awful, tried to add but I'm sure he was already back on valorant."
im_Jahh,"As a new player, I feel the game could give us some tips or a tutorial of some sorts since even after 50 hours in, I feel completely lost in what I have to do in a lot of situations... what is worth looting, knowing what gear is good and what isn't, mastering the shooting and spray/recoil as those feel really different from most shooters, quests, healing wounds, broken bones, thirst, hunger, surgery, what food /med has what secondary effect... it is like Dayz in many regards, but some are just dialed up to 110%... and the most difficult to learn...the maps..


Damage and armor stats and contact points are also kinda hard to get used to. I can blast a full mag into someone, and he won't die as he has a tier 4 armor, and I only have, for example 5.45x39 ps ammo, but then spray an smg as a scav with shitty ammo and kill someone cause I hit their legs and not the body armor.

I died a lot in the beginning or didn't get to extract in time due to not knowing where in the gigantic maps players prefer to path/camp, how mutch dmg I can do and how mutch will I take or getting lost after a fight/ losing track of time.

Another thing I noticed, and this one I find funny, is that in scav runs, most new players I see murder other scavs on sight, even  when someone tried to speak with them, they shoot, to then just be obliterated by AI or some other scav that was in the area. When I began, in my 2 first scav raids, I just shot everyone I saw, to then just be taken down by AI, so I get where they come from, since the game never explains scav karma or how the AI reacts to Scav on Scav violence.

Overall, I  am enjoying the game a lot, but the new players' experience is kinda tough."
TrunkLid,No worse feeling than one tapping a dude in a bush and seeing a Level 1 dog tag.
Time_Tu,"Unless I'm trying to complete a mission, I've been holding back on killing Timmies. I tend to just VoIP to them to hek off, and just try be as scary as possible and I really haven't had a lot of issues. And whenever I see a hatchet runner I do not engage. Because they're either at rock bottom or trying to enjoy the game in a way that doesn't harm me. I understand people arent really willing to take these risks, but I find I'm successful enough at the game to play with whatever kid I want whenever I want. 
At the very least people could VoIP more, I always VoIP something funny to say or light-hearted banter. Just trying to have a good time, and not be this stone cold sweat Lord that farms every moving object in the game."
SKRS421,"the game needs a tab for an intetactive map that we can pull up. we can already buy some of the maps from traders, it'd be nice to be able to place custom markers & labels.

like, allowing us to manually put markers on it for places we discover, landmarks, extracts, quests, items, etc.

similar to how different groups have different callouts for locations.

it can still be unforgivingly difficult because we have to basically make our own map markers, and in-raid we'd still have to pull up the map in one of the tabs to view. but it would be super valuable to have that on hand in-game for new & returning players learning maps. we already recieved more *special* slots in past updates, a map slot shouldn't be an issue i imagine. it's the system to allow us to manually customize it with our own markers/labels, and then bring it into a raid, which could pose an issue in accomplishing for the dev team ontop of everything else."
giggle_stickz,"As a new player I dread playing as PMC. My survival rating is 29% but that is only because I am sometimes able to avoid the other PMCs. All other times I engage my survival rate is probably less than 5%, yikes."
Nedgeh,The only reason I feel bad for killing newer PMCs is that they've added so many restrictions to flea market that not a single piece of gear save for MAYBE their pistol/flashlight would be worth picking off their body. Outside of abusing them to complete weird jaegar tasks it is an ultimately unfulfilling experience for both of us.
Sazbadashie,"Look I had a duo on factory right... and I had a ppsh, 71 rounds, had the leg meta ammo, even though I suck at leg meta but I love the ppsh  so I was going and i run into one guy I thought he was alone and he probably wanted it to be that way. so we got into a fight in the tunnels where that little out cropped area is that leads into the pit I dont know how to describe it and I unload 71 rounds into him on the ramp and he drops as a bloody mess on the floor, I turn left into the out cropping  HE HAD A TIMMY I felt so bad because I went to fire at the Timmy I didn't know how much ammo I had in my drum *Click* so I have to reload into a stick fired, didn't kill him, he hobbled off his PMC huffing and groaning I reload my last mag and fire a short burst and I finish him. Level 9 and level 19 probably the level 9's first wipe and the 19s second or third wipe based on how they were playing I felt like I need a drink and hand myself into the cops because I didn't even play the fight that well."
Ruffyhc,"Killed Yesterday a Team . One was Like ""WE can be Friends, No need for violence i am alone and new"". Well , as i heard them fighting i knew whats Up. Also Holding Angles with flashlight on gives an Idea. Turned Out lvl 29 and 34 with Meta stuff. Surely alone and new ...

Situations Like this are the reason i wont Trust anyone."
BigManofWA,"Is there anything more sad than when you kill someone (especially on Factory or Customs) and they're level 1-3 and have WAY too many meds, ammo, mags, etc on them and they just didn't know any better?  And even if you were inclined to take all their stuff because 'That's TarkovTM'/'Welcome to Tarkov', it's like four cheese meds and 7 spare sks mag, each full of t-45 because they don't know how the sks works lol...  This game just throwing them into the deep end with no instruction or tutorial (or even something just saying 'try offline mode first you utter noob, you dont lose gear if you die in there' from Prapor would be a huge help lmao)...

I and many others lucked out that we got into it from friends already into the game many years ago, and they were able to spend hours explaining shit to us at first so we bypassed a ton of the 'learning' confusion before losing our entire stashes."
isad0rable,"I killed a level 1 as a scav yesterday. Saved his dog tag and friend requested him. Waiting to see if he‚Äôll add me. Want to give some advice, maybe a nice gun idk. Felt terrible though."
No-Carry-7886,"Yea I super feel bad for killing low levels, like, it's not fair at all."
DafaqYuDoin,I literally cry whenever I pickup a tag under 6. I‚Äôm only level 15 but it still feels bad af
Synchrotr0n,"What it sucks the most in this game is the god damn sound. Yeah, I know it's bugged right now, but even in previous versions of the game we could still hear someone sneaking from so far away, which is not only unrealistic but also extremely unbalanced and unfriendly to new players, because sneaking is the only method available to prevent death while being undergeared or outnumbered but it simply doesn't work at all in this game because everyone has superhuman hearing. 

I was trying to complete the Audit quest in Streets of Tarkov today, but as I got close to the building I heard gun shots nearby and some gigachads coming inside the quest building. I stood still outside for a while, but after I stopped hearing sounds I sneaked at the slowest speed, without being heavy, and with rain outside, but that was enough for the chads to hear me and rush for the easy kill."
DafaqYuDoin,Honestly it would be nice to see an option for sub 10 players to select noob lobbies. Could really help new players get into the game a little smoother.
the_th1ng,"You unloaded 60 rounds into a ""timmy scav"" ?"
Lucien899,Welcome to tarkov where you get your dick constantly kicked in ...........  thats the only anwser you should provide we all go through this new or not plus newbies gotta learn and that is the only way they will learn .
GamersGen,am I the only one who is tired of this bs posts like 'i miss the old tarky'? Game is constantly improving and is as good as it gets now and you should be happy there are so many more people acquiring and supporting the team
MaZN_Instinct,i just started playing and ive told some people im new and theyve helped show me extraction points but its so hard idk what to do and the quests feel so difficult for me to find anything i need without looking it up on the wiki. My friends and i all bought it but they all lost interest after a few days of playing cause idek what the hell im supposed to do.
xRainb00w,Not only that the game keeps getting worse and worse for standard account players
Fexxzz,That's why I always stash gear of low players somewhere. At least they'll get it back if they insured it
Niebosky,Played 10h. I really tried.
jlebrech,I'd like level gated versions of maps.
SuicidalMouse,"Dude I have no idea what I'm doing. I played back in January of 2020 and decided to try it again last week. I think I have tried around 30 raids (pmc and scav) and only made it out 3 times. Which isn't the worst but most times I died. I have no idea why or a random npc scav just headshot me out of no where without making a sound. 

I'm so lost, I've got no idea what to do or how to improve. I feel like there is nothing to do against experienced players or npc scavs."
Dustin_Live,They must feel my pain
SKOL-5,"Went on woods without anything to do a quest, simple timmy.
Found someone geared and asked him where prapors convoy is, he was polite and directed me, his friend mowed me down afterwards.

10/10 would quest again"
LocksmithCharming790,I feeled so sad yesterday. I killed a level 2 with his m4a1 kit and he even got drinks and food on him in a factory raid. üòÖ
Kyparnn,"Aww man now I feel bad. Yesterday I decimated a lvl 9 USEC who only had a tomahawk, armband and an empty chest rig. Heard him looting the gun box in one if those litte sheds outside power station on interchange and popped him with a magnum buck without hesitation. I wonder why he was so unkitted though at level 9. Maybe he'd been boosted by a friend and this was his first solo raid, or maybe I killed a streamer doing some type of challangeüíÄ (RIP my account). Regardless, if you're reading this, I'm sorry and I hope that rig was insured."
MarshyFam,"I feel no remorse, as I've been mercilessly executed because I'm wearing stuff they want even after helping people out with quests. At this stage, I'll hang out but if I kill a Timmy; Ill just chuck their trash gear in a hedge so they get it back in insurance and go about my day xD"
LightTrack,"They should propably add a map system to the game so people aren't so intimidated. Maybe have a map at a bus station on streets, at the dorms, various mall maps at interchange etc indicating where you're at.

It would certainly help the new player experience as map knowledge is the biggest thing to learn."
Ill_Animator394,I usually just hope they insured their stuff and stash it somewhere :/
261846,It‚Äôs why my ass sits on shoreline. Relatively peaceful. I only leave when I‚Äôm trying to do quests that require me to go to other maps
Psychological-Monk30,"Just a min ago i was at 3 story dorm on custom and a timmy jumped over the bed to get the machinery key i shoot at him down the hallway.

he start screaming : PLZZZZZZ JUST LET ME GET THE KEY. Then he start to cms.

I was like ok man , so i just jump in front of him and stare at him waiting that he get the key i even let him CMS all the way up. Once his CMS is done he get his gun out... i still look at him....he point the gun at me and start shooting... i shoot back and killed him.

You can't trust all the timmy. Some people struggle so much to get some PMC kill that they will try to stab you as soon as you give them the chance. He tried to kill me with his pistol instead of his smg...so i assume he was trying to do the 3 pmc kill with pistol quest."
LordOfTheSlipOns,Pre-VoIP times where you slam your knife against a wall to signal you‚Äôre friendly ahhhhh
HeavensAnger,My buddy killed a group of 3 lvl 1s on shoreline yesterday...we almost had to have a memorial service for them...so sad.
NubCak1,"Wiped a 5 man timmy squad on customs today felt great.

First two were shot in the head in crack house from stronghold, last 3 were holding ground floor.

Killed them all with a single svds mag.

Excellent."
lemonlixks,"No one ever communicates on voip, it's so sad for new players like me trying to make some friends lol"
Ok-Street-7240,Then they rage hack our ass
LasseT95,"I almost only play scav because every time i play PMC i get one tapped by teams with the best ammo, armor and weapons in the game. Even if i used good gear, i would get destroyed all the time."
Disastrous_Scholar76,You dumped 60 rounds of BS into a scav?
Penguinwolf4,As if old tark was any better for new players.
SmokeyDaReaper,"Yeah I've kind've lost my touch with this game. I'm really new but keep getting wiped. I love this game to a point, but I find it tough for new players like myself. Haven't played in a week now."
AttackerCat,"We were running a 5 man in interchange this past weekend. Three of us are level 15-18 and the other two are new, under level 5, though all of us have under 100 hours. Doing a basic run to get foodstuffs for stash.

We came across two player scavs who only saw two of us at first who asked us if we could co-op extract (they just looted the lockers in front of goshan). Two of us had bumped into them but the other three were back behind us in case things went bad. We agree to co op, all finish up looting and when we regroup to head out these two scavs lost their minds that we had a full squad. Running through to scav camp as a 7 man team through the mall was pretty cool. The scavs scouted and let us know of any AI scavs nearby, and we all extracted together."
RetroactiveThoughts,Close your heart to their suffering. Do not allow yourself to feel for them. They will not feel for you.
Project131-Nomad,"I've been introducing my friend to Tarkov (haven't played in almost 2 years so I forgot most of the game myself). Ran PMC and VOIP with 2 Scavs that seemed friendly at first, next thing I know they unload mags into my face and my friend's. 

I've had a couple good interactions with players but it's stuff like that that irritates me. I just want to learn the game and stuff I've missed without automatically going to ""shoot first, ask questions later"" mode. Criticism is welcome, I'm probably just playing the game wrong lol"
Partytime79,"I killed a lvl 2 yesterday on factory. He had his standard m4, trooper armor, blue helmet, a couple of mre‚Äôs and a bottle of water. Poor guy. In hindsight, he obviously had no clue where he was or what he was doing. Should have let him live another day."
DeckerR,"2017-2018 Tarkov was more fun, but just as harsh on newbies. The wiki wasn't nearly as developed. The /r/tarkovtrading subreddit helped a little if you knew about it, but new players were pretty fucked since day one."
RampaginPoptart,As a new player can confirm
Chadgiggs,"Voip is the second worst thing they have ever done to this game, right after the recoil getting FUCKED, Good thing BSG already has our money and does not give a fuck about anything else besides selling new accounts to cheaters."
briandabs,The games isn't designed to be friendly. If I wanted to make friends I'd play something else.
REDLINE70689,"Killed a level 2 last wipe who had a dorms marked in his pocket. Poor bastard probably had no idea what he‚Äôd found. Hid all his gear, but I felt terrible."
Sp3ctre777,I feel bad about killing Timmy. I feel like I‚Äôm killing future pvp when Timmy gets whacked
Honest_Bat_7265,Then dont kill him...
Income-Cute,"When I was new to the game running around killing juicers it felt so good. 

Now the game has changed tremendously. And I‚Äôm the juicer running around killing timmies, and i can tell it‚Äôs no fun for either of us."
mackan072,"It's not even that new players necessarily are 'bad'. In many instances they are stuck with low level traders and poor access to the things they need to compete, the way they would in other games.

Experienced players can (somewhat) work around parts of this with some knowledge of how ammo/armor works - but new players end up losing because they're simply not able to penetrate armor.

Tarkov never really explains penetration values, or the different damage values of different rounds. Unless you know to look for these stats on third party pages, you don't know what armor you're able to deal with, or which ammo to choose if you realize you won't be able to deal with armor, and instead opt to go for legs."
sm0keasaurusr3x,"His fault for not communicating

Also, he lost nothing on that scav run :shrug:"
OverBand4019,I always give a little oh god no he was only level 4 before looting ever single thing off his corpse.
FenrisMech,"While doing some loot runs on reserve my buddy and I run into many low level players, and player scavs. And I can't help but feel sorry for sniping them from across the map since they're completely unaware of what happened."
Supercalifragicahfuq,Same. Especially when they‚Äôre right outside a quest area and I one tap them.
El_Oso_75,The only thing you should feel bad about is your aim.  It really took you 60 rounds of bs to kill a Timmy? For shame
Demetrijs,"Game could benefit so much from a co-op campaign. No wipes and you can play through the story with your friends in a hardcore experience. Maybe a separate character from online, once the full story is in game. But this would open the game up to a ton of normal people who cannot put 15+hrs/week into the game because they have a job/responsibilities to take care of."
killerallen0703,Ya I am still new to Tarkov I've got like 4 record hours on my account and I've only had one successful exfill as a scav and all I did was loot two containers shot one dude (no idea if he was a player or not I just shot) and most times when I play as a PMC I get domed by the bots
SpectreSquared,"8 hours in, have had multiple similar interactions with you vets"
autismo-nismo,"The game was supposed to make changes to make it new player friendly. Instead if made the veterans of the game more inclined to chad their way through to unlock flea and traders. 

For example, the vector gunsmith task,

I found the stock adapter, 6 inch barrel, and the rail system for that task all in 1 raid on reserve in white horse. They actually frequently spawn their as I have found rare parts multiple times in that building for the gunsmith tasks that people are struggling to get and are having people do barter trades for insane trade items like a green labs card for the parts.

So people are trying to grind even harder at the expense of new players learning to play."
Serious-Squirrel-220,I don't want peace. I WANT PROBLEMS ALWAYS
riceputting123,Good. They must suffer like I have
Hybrid-Black,"i felt so bad last night on shoreline.,
 I killed 2 scavs and not even 30 sec later 2 PMC sneak up to loot thinking its all clear, both lay down to loot them and i proceed to head shot both. when i get down to loot them its a lvl 1 and 2 on shoreline. 

i hope there stuff is insured  i tossed it all in a bush."
Elm_road,"The Sherpa program is designed to help, but after playing for 4 wipes. Have yet to encounter one. Initial thoughts are the larger player base vs sherpas. That being said, rework the Sherpa system."
rednunz,"I was doing a quest to explore two areas of a map  when two PMCs saw me and absolutely blasted me. I was nearly dead and yelled out, ""I'm new! I'm just trying to do a quest!!"". They stopped shooting, came over and dropped me a grizzly to heal up, then escorted me to the quest locations and then escorted me to the Evac. 

There still are some nice people out there... But they basically said they kill all PMCs on sight most of the time because they have no idea whose friend or foe and a majority of the time it's a foe. So I technically should have gotten killed but I was lucky to somehow hide behind a rock in VoIP range of them lol"
snaapshot,People really need to talk more upfront. Makes the game so much better especially for newer players.
