Starly2,"I only found out yesterday that I had completely forgot to hook up 5 assemblers to a manufacturer that was making heavy modular frames

That factory wasnt new either..."
Vegetable-Cat139,You forgot lack of space in the newly built factory!
skinrust,Supercomputers. Those fuckers manufacture at 1.875/min. What the fuck kind of number is that. Kills me
Slamb73,"Set up 36 constructors for something that fed into a series of assemblers. My math perfect. Plant perfect. 

Could not figure out why it wasn't giving me the parts I thought it should.


Didn't power 3 of them and didn't select recipe on another 3."
Vencam,"Reminder that there exists the [bug card](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/tgcf17/reminder_for_all_pioneers_that_care_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) too!

(Though load-loss and duplication are now gone)

Edit: grammar"
kuba_mar,Ive built a factory and right after i finished it i realized im gonna have to tear it down and start to scratch.
TheRealOWFreqE,Thankfully every single one of those problems are solved with experience ðŸ˜ƒ
Erisiah,"I have to redo the crude oil piping (and likely the heavy oil residue piping) in my Spire Coast Plastic, Rubber & Power complex. 6 hours after firing it up for the test run, and sloshing issues starved enough refineries to cause a seemingly unrecoverable 20% throughput drop. Kinda need to solve it now so I don't repeat the mistake in the 3 other parts I intend to build."
fathervice,60% of all my problems are not making large enough buildings and then I just move forward anyway instead of building a larger foundation.
BT9154,"Liquids in pipes travelling at any reasonable distance.... I have 800 hours in over two playthroughs in and I'll never understand how it works. One section of pipe is full, the next section is empty, why are you like this? It's usually the root cause of the pain of trying to get all the input/outputs to match perfectly."
playr_4,"I've never actually had the electricity problems, and I don't even have nuclear reactors yet."
tolacid,I've never understood people doing math for this game. I'm at the last tier and haven't so much as taken notes
Wooden-Trainer4781,"My calculations - 30 fuel gens 
Reality - baerly 28"
UristImiknorris,"Set up a heavy modular frame factory, power it all up, come back three hours later and wonder where my output is, and why all the lights on my iron smelters are red...

(I always forget to set the recipe on smelters for some reason)."
Outside_Assignment40,Ill need to dismantle my whole base and build it from scratch because i cant fit train stations anywhere ...ill start it tomorow (next week/ month)
Roundy_Roundy,I made a crystal oscillator factory a while back and accidentally calculated all of my inputs for double the number of manufacturers I planned for. Iâ€™d built the factory up against a rock so I had to haphazardly cram another 8 manufacturers around the backâ€¦
Thornz2000,Draw 25 cards.
kionay,If I could just make aluminum scrap without outputting water I would be _so_ happy.
ZERO_2065,The one wrong calculation in the upstream
Dzyu,I play multiplayer and the bugs and stability issues are just killing our desire to play this game.
alexsbz,"First time I had seen this image I was like â€¦.. oh look his smile , poor boy. If he only knew â€¦."
Mattlonn,Kinda burned myself by trying to have a 100% efficient system. Is that the wrong way to go since i got tired of the game as soon as i reached stage 5?
FreshPitch6026,You can eliminate wrong calculation by paying attention in school.
