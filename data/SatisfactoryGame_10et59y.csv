Blind0bserver,It's so frustrating. I have so much packaged fuel that I could be the God King of the Mad Max wasteland but my chainsaw wants to be *eco friendly*.
MeltsYourMinds,Turbofuel jetpack anybody?
plunkheadshot,Wouldnâ€™t the only use of the chain saw be to get more biofuel? If you donâ€™t need it why are you using? Or am I just doing something wrong lol
Quad-Watermelon,I'm fine with biofuel at any stage. It is pretty handy that you can always get it right where you need it. What bothers me is the stack size of fuel for the jetpack. I would even make turbo fuel exclusively for the jetpack if only that were possible.
Profitsofdooom,"I haven't played in awhile but I made a composter as part of my organization area. Just empty your pockets into a container and it sends anything not bio to a reject bin and then sends any bio stuff to a small subterranean factory that makes paint, fabric, and biofuel then sends those into the storage facility."
Gunk_Olgidar,Powersuit mod is your friend.
houghi,"As I never have any fuel on me, I have no issue whatsoever with solid biofuel being the only option. I go days without the use of a chainsaw and I use a mod where I cut down one tree at a time."
PersonalitySea4015,"Spent an hour setting up an efficient TurboFuel rigging.

Come to find out I still need biofuel to remove trees from my factories ðŸ™ƒ"
xXDasher92Xx,"Iirc, the actual reason is the same as why we canâ€™t use turbo fuel in jet packs: itâ€™d be very difficult to code different fuel consumptions alongside different fuel outputs without getting a few million errors."
RMSHN,Because in the late game you don't need to use a saw because you don't need to harvest biomass and you can use nobelisks to clear surfaces.
Phoenixness,Penance for not clearing the way with explosives of all varieties. One Ficsmas and you're set for life with snowballs which are just little nobelisks.
No-Instance-9699,"I just blow everything up now, idgaf"
DjBurba,Why use a noisy chainsaw when you can nuke the entire map?
KYO297,"Nah, late game I use nobelisks"
fireandbombs12,This but the jetpack and turbofuel
