RoamingFox,"> I'd ask him to realize that he's making the educational process more difficult for everybody

This _is_ the point. They want the public school system to fail because it has laws about teaching children fairly and accurately. They want a world where everything is private and free to teach kids the twisted ideals that they themselves believe."

scanvector,"""As the Americans learned so painfully in Earth's final century, free flow of information is the only safeguard against tyranny. The once-chained people whose leaders at last lose their grip on information flow will soon burst with freedom and vitality, but the free nation gradually constricting its grip on public discourse has begun its rapid slide into despotism. Beware of he who would deny you access to information, for in his heart he deems himself your master.""

Not only does he realize it, it's intentional.  

I get where this guy is coming from, but I can't help cringing a little whenever someone describes this Grinch-style epiphany fantasy where the sociopaths and narcissists in the world can be made to suddenly realize they've been behaving badly and that hurting people for their own personal gain is wrong on a fundamental level.  Asking ""Have you no shame?"" will get you at first a bewildered stare, and then a half-smile as they realize that whatever malicious behavior they're engaging in is, at the moment, working.

The damage is intentional.  The cruelty is the point.  A lot more people need to understand this and stop investing in the false hope that finding a rational explanation is key to stopping it; their minds simply don't work that way."

Our previous president had a master of right wing propaganda working for his campaign and convincing the people that only their narrative is the right one. We’re being told that the leftists that are fighting this are the existential threat while armed thugs of the state either beat them down or sit idly by as the black shirts do it.

Those students get to walk into schools every day and see the effects of Republicans on society. You see a bunch of books covered up you ask questions like ""why are they covered? Who ordered them to be covered? Why are they trying to control me?""

This is how Republicans operate. Shortsighted. Long term pains for short term gains. They can convince some boomers this is a good move. But the kids growing up watching their teachers and education get constantly attacked by Republicans? They will remember. They will know  the GOP are crazy asshole control freaks who went after their minority friends and their education. And that's why the GOP's popularity is just in constant decline."

dggenuine,">	it would take me weeks, probably, to have to go through the process of trying to vet all of these books and get them in the system. So to me, this is just Big Brother looking over our shoulders, and fundamentally a violation of our first amendment right, right to free speech, and students' first amendment rights of free speech.

So this teacher objects to a state reviewing books that students attending state-mandated education might get exposed to because it might take weeks (probably not weeks of his own time, just weeks for the process to conclude. Maybe a one-time hour and then occasionally a few minutes here or there for new books.)

And this teacher is teaching government this year, but believes that his first amendment right prevents the state from restricting the materials he shares with students? (What does this teacher actually know about the first amendment…because he’s wrong.)

And this teacher thinks it’s appropriate to have a poster of george washington’s head on a sexually suggestive muscle bod in his classroom? Would RBG on a bikini model be appropriate? (It’s not appropriate to have sexually objectifying material up in the classroom. I get that it’s a joke, but it’s inappropriate.)

Yeah, ~~this is exactly the kind of teacher that I want nowhere near my kids~~. He’s entitled to his opinions in his personal life. ~~I don’t want my child forced by the state to be exposed to them during school, though.~~

Edit: it was way too harsh to say that I wouldn't want a teacher like this near my kids. For one, the teacher clearly seems to care about teaching, which is already a lot for someone in a profession that gets way too little respect and support. For second, good for him for challenging what his first amendment rights protect. While I do believe that state governments have the authority to review books teachers keep in public school for distribution to students, the only way we find out exactly where the line is drawn between the competing interests is for someone to challenge what they believe crosses the line. And one sure way to lose our first amendment rights is never to challenge their abridgement.

While I support children's exposure to classics (Voltaire) and different perspectives, I do think that the sexually objectifying picture is inappropriate, though, and it did make me wonder what else this teacher makes a regular part of the students' lives."
