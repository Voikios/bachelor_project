irze,It’s made even worse by the fact that there’s been a bug for months that even if you cancel a listing it still takes up a slot
Kefeng,"Optimistic answer: Because in 1.0, everything will be balanced.

Pessimistic answer: Because they have no idea what they are doing."
Anything_Intrepid,"Because it's easier to just crush the average player than do the hard task of combatting cheating, botting and RMT.

internet_please,"Most things aren’t even worth selling on the flea. Plus, trying to sell 150m rubles worth of stuff with only a couple slots is just not feasible or worth it."
FracWelll,"To ""combat"" RMT"
Trygvelurius,"You used to start with 3 slots like 2 years ago and if i remember correctly unlocking a fourth slot was not that difficult for a normal player, only 10 flea market rep, unless it was 10rep to unlock the 3rd slot when they first changed it to only 2 slots.

Probably the only people unlocking the third slot this wipe are the most hardcore players and cheaters."
attomsk,It’s like they built the flea for RMT only
Faesarn,"It hasn't always been like this. Couple wipes ago, IIRC you got one more slot at 10 and another at 30, which made it quite easier to sell things. Now I'm so bored I sell most of my shit to traders."
Chris__352,To stop RMT. As you can tell it worked. LMAO.

_asdfjackal,So that BSG can pretend to make the game harder for RMT while actually changing nothing for actual RMT people so they'll all buy new copies of the game again when the next ban wave happens during the next sale.
Gottabecreative,"My previous played wipe was 2 years ago and then I was motivated to sell on flea because there was a sense of progression. Now, trying to lvl up your flea offers is just another grind. I don't want to become a zombie just to feel like I am progressing ..."

xPizzaKittyx,"honestly don't even know how this mitigates RMT even the slightest, seems like everyone just has a hate boner for cheaters at the moment. RMTers gonna RMT reguardless.  


My assumption its there to keep people selling things fast instead of just having a bunch of expensive listings that are never going to sell, which as a result eases server load and also gets you to sell things faster. AKA a mechanic in the game that keeps you from just selling everything super fast at their optimal value. (this IS a flea market)  I do agree though, 10.0 rep for an extra slot is a little wild. Like why not give us a 3rd slot at 5.0 and then a 4th at 10.0, give the casual players a bit of leeway."
DucksMatter,"They did it to “combat RMT trading” thinking it would affect the RMT if they only had 2 sale slots. But much like all the other things they did to “combat RMT” it didn’t actually affect those partaking in RMT, it affected the casual playerbase."
OCWBmusic,You started with 3 and got an extra for every 10 levels of flea rep you got several wipes back. I miss those days.
schlosoboso,"how to fix all the issues with the flea/FIR/looting system

1) (ignoring durability items) you can only buy the CHEAPEST listing on the market. Someone lists a LEDX for 900k and you want to purchase the one at 1.1m? You buy the cheapest listing for the price you're willing to pay.

Durability based items would trade as they do currently, with a limit to pricing within half the minimum average and double the maximum average- to prevent listing these items for high prices for RMT.

2) remove barters. There is no reason to have this in the game. It just facilitates RMT and clutters up the UI. It's mostly scams, RMT, or an attempt to bypass the ABSURD taxes- speaking of stupid taxes:

3) remove the ridiculous scaling tax. Simply add in a flat tax depending on what kind of trading you want- a 2-5% tax would be acceptable in my opinion. There is no reason the tax for a 500k key should be 490k.

4) Remove the FiR restrictions on armor, weapons, and ammo and backpacks. Anything wearable shouldn't have those restrictions. Reintroduce all the previously banned from flea items from the flea, like labs keycards, NVGs, thermals, good ammo, etc. Add in durability on items (NVG Mounts, rigs

5) Remove all the DOGSHIT from the loot table. Ammo, armor and such that is WORSE than what is attainable from level 1 traders shouldn't be in the loot table. 85% of the ammo drops in the game aren't ever worth picking up, which is bad design. Attachments that are simply worse than what is purchasable by level 1 traders shouldn't drop. remove the clutter."
Tark001,"OP just save up 99 Graphics cards and put them up all at once, seems to be working well for the level 19 doing it at the moment."
ordinarymagician_,"something something anti-RMT something something slow progression something player base desires somethingsomethingsomething ""I already got your money, fuck you"""
JoseMnez,"Old system was better, you start whit 3 trades, when get 10 rep, you unlock 4, and when get 30 you get 5.

Correct me if im wrong :("
Scarity,"I'm writing a script that just cleans my stash for me. I'm trying to get it to work with icon detection, deciding wether to sell it to a specific vendor or list it on flea at a just below lowest price.

It's not the fastest, but I can run it while I go grab a drink. This is not a skill issieus, at 5000 hours, I'm rather sick of the repeat. I stopped picking up items last wipe just because I didn't want to deal with selling.

edit* Don't DM me to share this, I don't know BSG's stance on this and I don't feel like stepping on their toes"
SwiftBetrayal,Tarkov is dead. Just wait for dark and darker
EngiNERD1988,I’m pretty sure they are going to remove the flea eventually TBH
bufandatl,I think it’s ok. TBH in all the time the flea exists it’s at the best state where it is now. Level 15 to unlock is reasonable. Not endgame gear is ok too. I can use it to get the last piece of a craft or hideout upgrade. Trying to find AA batteries atm and with 4 to 6 hours a week it can take time to loot all the stuff you need for a craft.

DrXyron,"Why do you need to sell anything on the flea, and why is the 3rd spot so important for you? I’d understand if you said you wanted to barter scam. But other than that really, selling things around market value will make it so that deals go through quite quickly."
BlackKnight6660,Tbh I don’t get why people are complaining so much. 2 flea market slots are more than enough if you actually think about the order you sell things and the price you sell them at.

Southern_Media_1680,I mean i only play on weekends and I've managed to get more than halfway already
bungothecat,And you'd think with these nearly impossible incentives that it would remove people who got to this high rep early into the wipe :)
Rootorii,"Time is money friend, sooner or later you will start dumping 90% of the loot to traders instead of maximising profit on flea.  


Also the don't forget there are fee on flea"
12161986,No clue. I see people with 299 GPU selling them for barters or insane amounts of money yet I’m a cuck that can’t put more than 2 items on the flea at the same time because they need to make sure I’m pricing every item to sell fast so that I’m driven to RMT.
elrabbit0,"It hasn't \_always\_ been like this. Everyone used to start with 3 offer slots. And there was a time when the flea market didn't exist.

I can't say that having only two slots is really that big of a deal. Even three or four slots can be really restrictive. If you want to spend as little time on your inventory screen as possible, just vendor the stuff that won't sell quickly / doesn't sell for much over the vendor price.

I think most people that play fairly casually can get to three slots by the end of the wipe."
ZorinhoX1,What are the  3/4 trades?
Key_Transition_6820,"Its for later when its fully out and to help find RMT. Literally nobody should have these high price requirements except cheaters. 

Also you don't need the flea, most items up there except gold loot and quest items which are highly inflated can be sold for the same amount as a regular trader with flea fees. 

Ex: tubes are 15k and some change on the flea its selling around 20k but with a 3-4k fee. its usually the same price or slightly better."

2) Reduce insane prices and scam listings. (Imagine how many san-tape key barters that no one in a million years will ever trade would exist without it) It would be like 100 pages worth.

3) Attempt to extend out the early game and try keep items closer to their vendor values.

Of course in typical BSG fashion every change they make has a whole host of unintended side effects that they hadn't considered."

What am I supposed to do until I unlock the fleamarket? I can't buy good ammo or gear from the vendors at my level, but to level up I need to actually do well. But to do well, I need gear. It feels like a catch 22.

Edit: also I have to find 2 salewas in raid. Picked 2 off a dude and extracted. Not FIR? What gives? Is it because the guy I killed brought them in and they weren't FIR for him?"
blradj,"sure bro, good point, they are already changing it, in this exact moment (they are not, and they will not)

PongoFAL,never understood this one.
Gluckman47,"Maybe for economic reasons. You can't sell items for price you really want or for average cost. You have to sell items here and now for current price if you want to sell 10+ different items.

Sargash,"So they can clearly see who the cheaters are and deal with them most efficiently, and swiftly.

SyntheticSins,"Honestly the flea market is only viable early & mid wipe. Late wipe everyone has all hideout items and prices settle to basically whatever the barter trade equilivent is worth. The economy is not a ""Real"" economy. What traders buy items like guns and armor for is often the lowest its worth players to sell things on the market for, and the price traders sell items for is often the ceiling for the market as well.  


There need to be some items that are ""Market only"" That are limited to maps or have some sort of rarity that will determine their actual market price. Some guns/armors that traders will not buy or sell to be a real, fluid dynamic economy."

Alpha Armband player here.   The Flea will always be a grind.  There are ways to get up there quicker it just requires more crafting to sell those items on the market as well."
abtei,to keep the loot goblins (aka cheaters) occupied a lil while longer.
lazarusdmx,"They gave you less slots to start with, used to be 3.  It was still 10/30 rep for the slot expansions, so you could get 4, and then 5 slots eventually.  It was a bit easier to get the rep, even without finding crazy expensive stuff, because you could do things like craft junk boxes overnight and sell in morning, usually for around 800k-1mil, stuff like that, would add up pretty quick alongside your regular listed items to get you to 4 slots. Also not sure if you can do this anymore, but used to flea my thicc case and weapon cases back in the day that you got from quests, which were 6-21mil. Usually to fund completion of my bitcoin farm.  I don’t think any of that works anymore."
SnooChocolates1070,Unless you're one of those people who try to sell a magazine for 100k roubles then you really don't need more than one or two offers at a time.
thecodehermit,I always thought it was to ease the server load. The less listings the happier the servers ?

GoobyPlsBro,"It doesn't make much sense anymore. Some time ago people could sell all sorts of gear without restriction

Some time before that, found in raid didn't even exist, so people could buy and resell stuff and make profit out of the flea.

Now I don't see the point, most of the stuff on the flea is mediocre at best.  There are fewer items that you can actually make profits on(hideout items mostly) At this point, they might as well remove it, as it sucks balls"
Stew514,Because it's slowing down the RMTers!!! /S
iLol_and_upvote,"once upon a time you could get into the hundreds of trades with high flea levels (30 at level 30). a lot of people played tarkov market instead of the game and it wasnt the direction in which bsg wanted to take the game, so that got cut down a lot

how it is now is after many nerfs to flea trade spots"
SqookyBoo,I sell everything i get just about on flea if its found in raid its probably more on flea now some cases they undercut a ton and you can even get them for less then what they sell to traders and profit
Daisy_Bloodworth,No this hasn't been always the case. Like 2+ wipes ago I usually had about 10+ slots at the end of a wipe. Now I rarely get above 4.
kglfish,I sighed aswel when I checked wiki and it said I need lvl 30 flearep. when ive been playing much for a month and got 5 currently WTF

goodsnpr,"Because you don't need to sell all 40 items you took out of raid on the flea. A lot of those items don't net you much more than if you sold to vendor, especially once the fee is taken into account."

StatutoryApee,They 'beat cheaters' by making the game aids for everyone else.
Shiner00,"The only reason they did this was to ""stop"" RMT and cheaters like every other dogshit change they've made when in reality it literally only made it possible for players to get this if they ARE cheaters.

It used to be at like 3.0 or 5.0 or something you got another trade then 10.0 and it was a lot better because you could sell more than two fucking items lmao."
Larken_Virch_Furchin,My guess would be its to simulate the fact that loyal and respected customers/traders would get access to better stuff as a reward?
pthumerianhollownull,"Never had 3 slots, and I don't care."
idontknowmyname332,I get why they have done it. If poeple can post more the market would be flooded with items bringing their price down but man is the whole i need to sell on flee to get the best value is a pain in the back side. I spent more in my hide out then playing the game
Alarmed-Cheek-39,Use to be 3 then 1 and now 2 it’s not really even annoying or hard to deal with just play the game lol
NomadBrasil,"The answer nobody is giving.

Because Nikita dislikes the way the flea market works, the player-driven economy is out of his control for the most part, and he wants players to use traders more.

He literally said that already on tarkov podcast."
strangeorawesome,They do this so you have to upgrade to EoD.
BeneficialMix7851,Hard to tell who’s worse bsg or the isle devs

Disastrous-Reality61,Anti RMT effort gone wrong.
weaveryo,"Some of us have played the game long enough we know how to make money easily.

I’m approaching 200 scav runs on reserve. I think my survival rate on my scav is somewhere around 90%. Just scav night reserve. Learn the map. Literally every building has valuable loot. Majority of player scavs on reserve night runs are friendly. I don’t even fire my gun most of the time. I’ll drop meds for loot towards the end because there is no threat. 

I flea market everything that goes for more than 20k. I just got my 3rd slot couple days ago. I’ve never stayed committed long enough to get the 4th slot."
HSR47,">""Edit: So this post got a lot of traction, I hope we can convince BSG that we don't want to play Escape from Hideout manager""

It's not even about that.

I don't mind that aspect of the game, but I agree that the flea progression is completely fucked--you need to be a cheater to get even close to maxing it out, and that's **NOT** hyperbole.

In order to get to 1000 rep, you currently need to gross flea sales of 5 billion Roubles (50,000 Roubles == .01 rep)--if you have EOD, you can subtract 1 million from that figure. To get there in a ~6 month wipe cycle, that means that you need to gross almost 28 million roubles per day, for the entire wipe. If you played 14 hours per day, that would mean that you'd need to average about 2 million in flea sales per hour, every hour you were playing.

That's further complicated by the fact that you start out with a total of 2 flea slots, and you have to grind super hard to get it up beyond that--It makes it really hard to have high grosses relatively early in the wipe.

I chased max flea rep last wipe, and got up to ~150 by the end. If I hadn't taken 4-6 weeks off, I might have gotten up as high as 180-200. Even by getting *that* far, I know I had to have been in the 99.9th percentile of all legitimate players.

To get higher than that, the only way is to focus on super-high per-slot items, like LedX and similar, and the only way to find enough of that class of super-rare items to max out flea rep is to cheat."
Ronaldswenson,Because the devs don’t know what they’re doing
Epicpacemaker,Well how else are RMTers suppose to get a one up on the market??
romanische_050,Kinda confused what you trying to buy or sell...
3Foss,"I think most players will get 3 or 4 slots unlocked, we are not far into the wipe, the fleamarket is only beginning to stabilize from barter items needed for hideout.. im level 35 and have three slots. Its a grindy game for all skills/unlocks/traders, why should flea be different?"
TherealPadrae,Why do you need 3 offers if you don’t sell much on the flea market? If you start selling alot you will unlock the 3 offers… it’s a progression feature like how it takes a insane amount of time to reach max strength. Stop crying.
MixmixMcFatcat,"It's not very apparent, but the main reason (as far as I can tell) is to limit stuff that is on the market, persumably to create some (forced) scarcity."
BrockTestes,To limit how much money you can make?
remouladefreak,"We’re 3 weeks into wipe and i’m at 10.02 flea market rep, just get used to selling EVERYTHING on flea market. Even tho you loose money from fee compared to just selling to vendors. Just sell it on flea and ge the rep. Everything above 10k is worth selling, and if its a valuable like a gold egg which therapist buys for 42k, just sell it for like 39k on flea market and get the rep."
Fluid-Imagination-38,Already past a 100. Also most of your items that you sell if you sell them correctly dont just sit on the market very long. They are gone in seconds. Honestly only need 1 trade.
ShoulderQuick9618,Okayyy buddy
FunstuffQC,Why does anyone need more than two listings? personally? My stuff usually sells so fast that theres no reason to ever have more than two?
EisKohl,You guys sell on the flea?
PlayMaGame,"Because before you could flip items and that was a very easy progression. The devs haven’t changed rep requirements from that time, but flea marketable items have changed by a lot. I totally agree that now the requirements should be way lower."
irobotik,At this point I think the FIR flea market sale requirement does more harm than good.
Kelter_Skelter,They do it to discourage flea use. They think if is annoying to buy and sell on the market then people will do it less and use more FIR gear and loot vendor items more. Not sure if it's effective exactly.
hardkjerne,"They will probably add another slot again, but only for EOD players."
Zehny_,The actual question is why you think having more than 2 slots is a necessity. If you view the perk of having more than 2 slots as an extra for flea market enjoyers it easily makes sense for it to be far away. Of course if you feel entitled to more slots then it wont. So why do we really need more than 2 slots? Never seen a proper response to this question.
Polizor22,Least of my concern considering I've almost never had to list more than 2 items on the flea.
LargeSticker,What’s so difficult? Just find 150 Ledx’s like a normal Chad
