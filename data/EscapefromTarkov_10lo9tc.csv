RickRate,is it instant or do we need to wait for a update?
M-Gnarles,"Weight limit is the big thing for me.

  
No longer am I a chonker whale stranded in Tarkov just because I choose to wear a tier 3 body armor and a VPO rifle."
Lazypole,The only thing on my list that wasn't addressed was arm stamina. I hate not being able to ads with a sniper rifle for more than a handful of seconds then take a 10s break.
waddlesmcsqueezy,How long did the community complain about recoil without changing it? So I guess when we want BSG to actually listen to feedback we have to get a popular YouTuber to do it?
redeyezer0,"I had already quit this wipe, reading this has me excited to get home and jump back in. Hell yes."
Maxos43,Is it me or BSG has tunnel vision on streamers ? :D
Rough_Bowl7621,"I dont type a lot or react on reddit, i just use it for news and funny times. BUT I NEED THIS TO BE SAID VERITAS I HOPE YOU SEE THIS TY, you've restored some faith in my friends and myself for this game. Cheaters and audio is still a bad thing but hey one step at a time. I think you need to take a day off and  let a few of us come take care of ya king"
FACEIT-InfinityG,"Veritas is one of those unlikable arrogant people that I have to admire and respect because although i detest his delivery the quality of his content is spot on I cant fault it.

I dont like him as a person but i like and subscribe to everything Tarkov he puts out to do my part making sure he continues."
luke6494,"LOL this community is wild. While the changes are great, the back and forth is ridiculous. One week we all fucking hate streamers, the next week we are making appreciation posts for them..."
Traditional_Ad1492,"The fact that most people in this thread completely ignore Klean and Trey24k is criminal. They had more to do with this than veritas imo. Although that video was goated, I think Trey and Klean were more focused on recoil."
HereFortheLulls,"> I am glad that we have such a mindful community that cares about the game and the way its going with its development phases.

I’m happy for the changes and commend anyone who moved the needle on them, but this is a massive self-suck.

We don’t have a community at all, and what we do have doesn’t “care about the game”"
BeefyZealot,"Luckily they at least listen to streamers lol. Imagine if we, beta testers could provide feedback….."
VNG_Wkey,"This community has been bitching about the stupidly high recoil for years now. Big streamer makes one video and it gets changed. They also still didn't fix one of the biggest issues, first shot recoil."
Masteroxid,Kinda sad that only content creators have a voice in the community but oh well..
y_not_right,"He’s not gonna fuck you bro

It’s sad bsg only listens to the super fan streamers"
SwiftBetrayal,This should be a sign to quit. Streamer opinion > player opinion = shit game.
Conflagrate1589,"Am I the only one who actually cringes at these immediate changes because of the Veritas video? Don't get me wrong, the video is great and so is Veritas, but the community has been begging for these exact changes for years.

  
While the changes are great, it is absolutely pathetic that we need a known youtuber to make BSG listen."
Mirroredentity,"Great changes. The only issue I have is guns having shit recoil in a vacuum wasn't the only problem, it's also the insanely significant difference between a stock gun and a meta gun. 

This makes the stock and budget guns useable which is great but also makes the meta guns laser beams like a few years ago. They needed to buff base recoil alongside nerfs to the higher end attachments imo."
Kilo-Nein,"Ok, so shit we as the community have complained about for AGES, but again, a streamer says something and \*BOOM\* changes are made..."
TheTacBacon,"This is awesome! The biggest thing to note is BSG actually listened, sure it took a big content creator to make a video but BSG listened and that in itself is incredible!"
Leytarkhan,Always a bad look when streamers have to rant about the state of the game for things to be done but the countless other voices fall on deaf ears especially when it comes to cheaters.
ricampanharo,but not you Rengawr! Fuck you!
stachu0440,"Im happy seeing the changes, but it still sucks how they only do something once a large content creator steps up"
aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,Wouldn't have this much success if BSG didn't ignore their community on every single platform.
my_tech_throwaway,Veritas complains about everything in the game honestly. He throws enough shit at the wall this one just happened to stick.
Conserliberaltarian,"Why does it take a streamer to get BSG to change things in less than a week, that the entire community has been complaining about for 13 months?!"
Gravitytr1,"""Greatly reduced penalties from armored rigs and body armor.""

How anyone but selfish full time tarkovers can think this is a good change is beyond me.

Welcome back to the juggernauts who take 4 mags and can parkour prefire you."
-ansr,"Pretty disgusting how they cater to 0.001% of the player base even though this is a good change.  
They also increased the restock time and lowered the amount you can buy it seems (?), restock timer on Mechanic was over 3 hours now, making it even more catered to the people who can play the game 22 hours a day."
Iceliker,"**BSG doesnt do anything: people angry**

**BSG does do anything: people angry**"
XDreadedmikeX,"I don’t like streamers dictating major gameplay features, it’s a terrible way to develop your game."
HappyMetalViking,The does listen to constructive Feedback. They just ignore the people being salty all the time.
_THORONGIL_,"It wasn't the video itself that sparked such a fast response, it was the reaction of the community. Everyone agreed. Literally everyone."
FactHot5239,Why does 1 person get acknowledgement when the ENTIRE COMMUNITY had to sit through this bullshit for a year and a half when all this fucker had to do was make 1 video showcasing old gameplay....
Crafty_Vanilla_418,The amount of streamer fellating is beyond cringe <3
Droidurloking4,Here comes laser beams
CeeDLamb,zero thanks for bsg for listening for the community lol
BL1FFORD,"not saying veritas didn’t make an impact but tarkov employees came off their break recently, and i’m fairly sure that’s why the changes were made at this time. just a coincidence"
WhiteLightWarrior,55kg and still regaining stamina.  Bless the lords!
overwatchlap,THANKS u/Tigz
bobby17171,"Veritas is a dweeb but if that video actually made bsg think about this, I thank him"
Myythy,"Veritas has always been the GOAT.
This playerbase doesn't deserve him."
tylersheen,You think this entire process was done in even a few days? you lot are insane.
Kerofenlik,">BSG actually tries to listen to its community

Don't be naive. They can listen only top youtubers and when they saying that they stop playing this game. But when a lot of regular players says same at BSG forums, they ignores community."
Shawzus,Surely I’m not the only one that sees this a massive coincidence that it came out so quickly after the Veritas video. Almost to quickly. Like it was already been worked on.
vgamedude,"Wow what a surprise BSG only listens to streamers like we already know. Let's just continue worshipping streamers even harder too! Great idea.

This community I thought was smart enough to see to cool it with the influencer worship but I was clearly wrong. I fucking hate this nugaming fad."
cringorig,I would like to join in thanking Veritas for all the work he’s doing.
Scape_Nation,"This sub cracks me the fuck up.  It’s as if people think in the hours after a streamer posted a video, BSG decided to, and implemented, an entire restructuring of recoil."
dollarhax,"Y’all are okay with this? Having the game determined by streamers? Things like these changes or how Pestily single-handedly whined his way to nerfing the mosin? Then acting like they’re representing you like some elected official?

Y I K E S"
CVShiro,"Changes like these don't happen overnight. They take time and planning. That they happened after Veritas made a video is nothing but a coincidence.

Granted, he does make good content but these changes were not a direct result of his video, but of continued efforts from the community and feedback gathering from the Emissaries and CMs for BSG getting sent to the DEVs."
Susp,We can thank Veritas when he stick his head out from Nikita ass
Joeys2323,I hope this community takes something away from this whole ordeal. In order to get your feedback noticed you need to display your concerns in a respectful manner (like veritas did)
Ovnii3,"Now just make ballistics make sense, repair audio, fix desync and it'll be the ultimate shooter for me"
Buchmada,I never understood why he got so much hate especially when his points have always been solid. I swear to god if I see anyone EVER give that man shit again after all he's done for this community I'll tickle their buns. He's always just tried to help us and he better finally get the credit he rightfully deserves. This man is an absolute legend and I bet he's on cloud 9 knowing he was so right even the devs agree.
Fun-Introduction-356,Veritas is fucking awesome. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a Tarkov content creator. Amazing in depth looks at just about everything.
straight_lurkin,I legit CANT WAIT for the next Pogcast lol going to be SO HYPE
nederlandsoldat,Thank you Veritas. I won't sell your guitar pick to the therapist anymore
WarmanreaperX,"It's gross seeing people bring this shit up. He contradicted himself making cod comparisons given tarkov pmcs and scavs aren't real soldiers, they aren't trained for combat either hence why we level skills. Alot of his info is straight up cherry picked and isn't even relatable to tarkov if you actually think longer than saying, well I just want Lazer beam guns."
,[deleted]
eddyxx,Veritas can you please drop a video about the T30 black missing from Ragman? Otherwise i'm gonna kill my self.
TheBigZamboni85,"Veritas and BSG, thank you!

Edit: looks like summits chat finally got out of school and are in shambles discovering the news lmfao. Get bent nerds"
DreadForge,"The guy is a cringelord douche streamer, but his videos (like the one above) are always, ALWAYS good."
GlizzyGlicks,Came to say agree! Veritas is a legend in the community!
JagarKlato,Veritas is dping it for his own pocket. I am not a big fan of laser guns
Dog-Parks,Veritas is king.
KerbalFrog,vERITAS LITERALLY FIOXED THE GAME WITH 1 VIDEO LOL
Careful_Window_8577,Nice
fightforvictory,love you Veritas!
AquaZack,"as vet of the game, i am really happy to see change things change a bit for the better."
FaithlessnessDeep492,"Don't get too happy boys, the game is still filled with ESP, hackers, RMT'ers & the audio is completely fucked.

I'm sure there's plenty of good ESP I could be using rather than relying on audio tho ;/"
NaNiBy,Game being balanced around content creators huh
SiiiKeee,Best update in a long time!! :D
just_ike22,"What i see a lot of people forgetting is the way 99% of the community came together in a positive and critical way after Veritas' video was shared here. It was really something good to see after all the hate. I mean truly many people were burnt out, disappointed and probably taking it out on each other. Seeing the majority of comments not only constructively criticizing what they disliked about mechanics WITHOUT bashing BSG into the ground, but also coming to major agreements was huge. Of course Veritas was able to articulate what the players and several other content creators had been pushing for years. But i truly think that the community ""coming together"" for once made a bit of a difference as well. I write this after OP's edit including the community so not saying that against but rather in unison with their post. Maybe this holds some light at the end of the tunnel. I was starting to doubt BSG, but waking up to see this was quite awesome. Maybe, just maybe well get the game we want and that BSG wants to give us some day."
NubCak1,"Agreed.  


FUCK TIMMIES"
mobit80,Ok I guess now we need streamers to start posting about audio and scavs
Shpongolese,"""oh no the people who spend their livelihood showcasing gameplay for the game with huge communities made suggestions that got things changed! HOW DARE THEY LISTEN TO THE STREAMER GUYS!""
fucking brain dead takes as usual, lmao."
NimbleBrando,"Recoil, weight, stamina and armor values have been changing every wipe since the game came out. You're a clown if you think BSG made all these changes in 2 fucking days."
Ikuorai,"ALRIGHT BSG WE SEE YOU, THANK YOU"
xNavyy,"People underestimate the role trey had in all of this. He was the first one to start that buff recoil movement. klean, veritas and a few more joined and did a GREAT JOB. But really if not trey and his dedication through the last few weeks i don't think all of that would happen"
entropygravityvoid,As a scav in class 4 armor + helmet I was able to survive rogue MG + assault rifle fire today and extract with 2 broken legs.
PsychoticReject101,"too bad the trader level changes and broken wall in the hideout make this feel like a mobile game, next patch is real world money payments to fix the wall and get regular exp gains again. A bunch of these changes are ""Hardcore"" youre just making the game more of a fucking chore than it has to, this game will get to the point where only streamers will be able to get anywhere or get anything done in a timely manner."
BecomePnueman,I think even they saw the video and realized how much more fun the gameplay was
_Doggmatik,Based and Wholesome Pilled
gudzgudz,"Thought I was dreaming......... no freaking way. Thank you BSG, Veritas, Trey24k, Klean and anyone else involved in voicing these gamebreaking balancing issues"
Wisemagicalhags,haven’t people been complaining about these issues since they nerfed recoil in the first place
Kaneypoo69,A bit pissed they only listen when someone high profile moans but at least it's happened. My love for the game is back
Rezhyn,Excited to see if his survival rate doubles or there is another reason it doesn't!
Tazoooooor,"great, hope one of them content creators now does a video on how rogues and raiders are still OP. Regular scavs received a nerf at the beginning of the wipe but the rogues are still instant aimbot.   
It's a shame I don't record my gameplay because I could have showed a ton of clips were rogues just 1v2 vs scavs or pmc in a fashion even worse than a cheater.   


Good AI isn't by making them have aimbot"
Event82Horizon,The speed how quick the mood changes in this SubReddit is a sight to be seen.
BLOODWORTHooc,ty based veritas
ShaddyDaShadow,But hes just a whiner with skill issue /s
Aelderbrand,"I'm sure there will be people screaming ""tHeY oNlY lIsTeN tO sTrEaMeRs REEEEE"" when in reality it's simply that level-headed, genuine and tested arguments for or against a system will always get further than self-righteous, puerile and putrid shitposts that do nothing but insult the developers ad hominem and offer no actual insight as to why their changes would be better.

Extremely thankful that there are people like Veritas who can actually make valid and insightful points about the how the game can be improved without resorting to vitriol, even if I don't always agree with their assessments!"
whoopsidaiZOMBIEZ,"well this is what it's all about.  when you are in early access for so long you might want to listen to the people that allowed you to... be in early access for so long.  and supporting the game means doing exactly what veritas did.  he used his platform to plead for the life of the game we all love(d).  well thanks to veritas they listened.  he may not have spoken for all of us but he sure as hell spoke for me.  i look forward to downloading and playing tarkov once again.  wow.  thanks BSG, this is how you regain support.  it might not be perfect but you all made an effort and that bodes well for the future."
Camidians,They addressed this as a bandage network and audio are still complete garbage. Hopefully this is then buying time for an audio and network update but they gotta do something. Veratas mentioned these issues but focused a lot more on network issues of shooting someone in the head and it not registering for 10 seconds. When that’s fixed I’ll celebrate.
MeLT_melt,almost like they went on holiday and didnt work on the game over the Russian Christmas but how dare they take holidays right?
WheatCakes12,now do a ban wave
Ren11234,Hell yeah
LowMathematician2930,Nice... still see yall in 2024
AGodOfWar-,I am so happy with the changes they made. It feels so much better even inertia makes sense now to me. It feels so fucking good
carnex13,hear hear
Ch40440,"How does it take THIS LONG??

How long has this game been out…"
MagicSceptre,"I personally couldn't care less, I've been adapting to this changing game for years and will continue to do so. These changes don't really mean anything to me, personally I wish everybody would just calm down and take a step back. Let bag make their game and play it or don't."
SMOKEthatGAME,Has anyone carry a tank battery yet??? Lol
m1n1nut,Who says it was a reaction. Why couldn't this have been something that was planned for a while but not ready until now?
PulledPorkPlease,"
You can’t give all credit to one guy. Thats kinda ridiculous and is kissing ass too much. 

Your edit is what the original post should’ve been."
bbplayer514,"The issue is BSG doesn't actually listen to the community. It's quite funny that these statements have been made for months about camera recoil being awful and wanting it changed. When do they start listening? To the community or the content creator? Because if the change happens right after someone made a video and not from the months long of suggesting changes for these issues, it's not listening as much as a knee jerk change that coincides with what people wanted from a video a content creator made. There's a list of changes that could be made that have been suggested for long periods of time by the community.

-Reduction of fog (honestly a massive gripe if you know how much global fog is actually put in place)
-Traders restocks by account, not global (I'm torn on that one but you can see how frustrating it was with Gunsmith tasks now more than ever)
-Work on audio improvements as in literally every single wipe

Just to name a couple. I don't feel like going through all of them but they get repeated and brought up every once in a while. BSG's pace of updates and work on the game is insanely slow, audio being the example here. It's not meant to be completely shitting on them because they do try and yes it is Nikita's vision of his game. However, if you do not listen to your player base in their feedback, you will lose them. The pace of updates and lack of content has lost players. However it has also brought players in. I remember seeing lobbies this wipe being more full than I ever have seen it. But the lack of content for a 6-8 month period kind of kills momentum. Factory expansion? Yeah...

I do hope they listen to us more because we do love this game. But being without a voice and not being heard is a problem. Because unless you have direct contact with them, you won't be heard. I got a false positive on my account 2 years ago and was unbanned a month after but I had to go through the official channels and emails and such. Here you have a streamer being banned live on Twitch falsely and they are unbanned within 24 hours only for that fact that they are a content creator. There are areas where they need to improve on and be better. Those areas are very noticeable. 

I hope the content starts rolling more and issues gets fixed as well as their lines of communication gets better. They aren't a smaller team like before. Just compare them to Facepunch. One has content pumping each month (used to be weekly or biweekly updates as well years ago) and the other has mediocre content to good content maybe 6-8 months that wears off quickly. New maps are great if you are able to play and run them. Map expansions are great unless it's literally a rectangle on a small map. Let's see how outraged people would have been for an Reserve expansion and the only thing they did was open and made more rooms at Dome and made it feel less empty. And that was the wipe and content we got for a wipe. Factory was pretty disappointing."
LittleArrArr,The veritas video was not very good and attributing these changes to his video seems disingenuous at best. All he did was vaguely complain while arguing that he wasn’t complaining. I saw none of the usual depth or detail that I expect from his videos. It was like the long form version of a TikTok clapback.
ProfetF9,"NEW DRINKING GAME!! For every post about the changes take a shot, for every reward inside the topic take another one"
