gaxit,Whoever at BSG made you lose 10% of your stamine when you stand up and then stop it from regening for 6 seconds needs to go to jail..
PanProjektor,Your highly trained ex-mercenary is shooting a rifle like a pistol. Not even.
Gloryhole_Operator,"We did 50km march with 30kg of ragbag plus weapons and armour

TP_Gillz,"First of all, very well written.

Secondly, I agree 100%.

Recoil and Stamina are two big ones that should be easy to implement change or fix. 

Why does it take stamina to crouch and stand up? I am simply playing a stamina bar game during engagements instead of focusing on the fight itself. You cannot move. Your like a big fat sausage potato man. It doesn't feel good.

Add that with the recoil issues and every single fight with automatic gunfire is PURE LUCK. 

These things have to change. Movement should be less restrictive. 

The audio is hot garbage, but the one single change that would make it somewhat tolerable is lowering the noise made when crouch-walking, turning or simply going to ADS. These sounds should almost be silent. As is, you are loud no matter what you do. Standing still so you don't alert the guy 100m away is not fun gameplay."
Alexxfernandes61,In the chase for realism battle state ironically moved further and further from it
ThexanR,One thing that actually has always bothered me is how meaningless hydration is but our PMCs can’t go 3 seconds hungry. You can go a month without food but barely 3 days without water yet it’s reversed in Tarkov
AetherBytes,"> My main question is why is their any upwards kick whatsoever in a braced shot?

Cause guns are broken and the stock is ignored; basically every gun recoils like a pistol (around the grip) rather than an actual gun (around where the stock meets shoulder)"
SipDhit69,"Take a look at the recent video Veritas did about what direction it feels the game is taking. He addresses all these concerns and gives a great explanation on why we feel this way. ""Realism"" is not an absolute descriptor"
Lyrekem,"The recoil thing is spot on. Feels like they're not even gripping the weapon, just resting it in their hand and letting it kick."
johnx18,You pretty much mirror every point from Veritas' new video.
lilwhiteboye420,I feel like the recoil would be better if all the guns werent giant pistols and the stock accualy did something except for phasing thru your shoulder like its not there the recoil could be half decent its sad that cod has more realistic gunplay than tarkov
GosnSrbin,"FULL AUTO AKM:

12yo kid from Somalia: easy and accurate gun, love it

Tarkov: free ticket to the moon"
unibomber24,The gunplay and recoil in “insurgency sandstorm” has been praised for being very close to real life. I hope tarkov changes it’s recoil to be more like insurgency.
N1LEredd,"Yes, plz more pile-on for this discussion. Something honestly is wrong when Warzone has more realistic movement and gun handling than tarkov. 

Something needs to change.

We need an adrenaline system when hit. 15 seconds when hit or closely fired at I.e. when stress resistance skill kicks in. It needs a deminishing return so it’s capped and reduced in duration when happening too often in x amount of time. Stamina drain when hit needs to be drastically cut down and stamina recharge should start earlier.

We can already change or walking speed. We should be able to do that for running - a jog should drain significantly less stamina than a sprint.

As discussed in many places before, PMC’s need to start at what’s atm about lvl 30 endurance and strength. There would be still plenty left to grind. Scavs aren’t trained operators so they start at 5/5 or 10/10. The current distances you can run are simply ridiculous.

Prone and crouch should no longer consume stamina - animation speed and acceleration are the only things that should be influenced by weight.

We need a way to silently put down our bagpack. Like when you hold the button you slide it down slowly. (Not my idea but a great one)

Camera recoil is hilariously over the top.

As is recoil as a whole.

As is the aforementioned uselessness of single fire.

*Something needs to change*"

Jehger,"You hit the nail on the head OP. But there will still be people in here saying ""go play fortnite if you want an easy game"". The funny thing is that most of the people complaing have way more playtime then the people that juste eat up what bsg pushes.

The game was so much better pre 12.12 when the recoil was actually in a good place, all guns where viable and all of the above listed stamina and inertia things didnt cripple an agressive playstyle."
Eibez,"imo the stamina limitations is due to the map designs, and rightfully so. The maps are not big enough to have a real pmc's stamina and be balanced."

BiggerFish09,"""In real life I can run with an 80lb ruck for 10 miles"" sure bro"
Elitevyn,"There are so many features in this game that aren’t fun, realistic, or balanced. If it isn’t any of those 3, why the fuck is it in the game? I understand they want the game to be hard but you have to find smart ways to do that, not make everything feel like garbage and turn the sliders all the way up"
Not-a-Scav,"“In real life I can run with an 80 lbs ruck for 10 miles”

I was US ARMY for 10 years , at my peak fitness level we would do ruck runs with minimum 45 lbs pack. For 8 miles. Not one person in my unit or anyone I’ve ever know ran continuously with that much weight on for the 8 miles.

So you’re 100% full of shit on that aspect."
Doktor_Kaputt,"All valid IMO.

The food thing is something that bothers me in a lot of realistic games. Look at DayZ for example. You can have a full stomach, close to vomiting, and a few hours later you die of starvation. At least in Tarkov its energy, but youre only out for a few minutes. Nobody would be needing any food. Maybe a little water from all the running, yes.

The sound is my second biggest gripe. Not only its technical side, but also the sounds youre making. You cant go silent at all. You always sound like an elephant running through a window shop. Yet walking carefully should make you much more quiet and even running can be done quietly.  
But also the looting sounds. For example you can open a file cabinet very quietly, but it would just take a bit longer.  
And of course the moans and grunting etc when youre wounded. Any (even untrained) guy would know to shut up when hes running to cover and trying to hide from the guy who just shot him, if only to hear if hes coming after him.

Anyway, we all love this game and want it to be better. Thats why we complain and dont just run away."
Litho360,"Has spent enough in game time to get kappa 5 wipes in a row, but claims to be built like a marine and run 10 miles with 80 extra pounds… yeah right, but yeah the game is kinda broken."
Blue_Eyed_Brick,Realism is when your PMC is less fit than Cartman
4309qwerty,"I agree that if you’re coming into eft for a realistic mil-sim, then yeah this is not it. Playing Squad or even the defunct America’s Army 3 would be more realistic than this. But there are some ways the game is becoming more “realistic” than last time.

I would argue that combat was way worse in the past. Remember when meds had no animation and you would just spam Ai-2/Salewa after taking any shot while in combat? Or when max strength and endurance would literally allow you to bunny hop across shoreline without running out of stamina? 

A somewhat recent example would be when you could shove entire mag/ammo cases up your butt, fire off a 60 rounder from your M4, swap to another weapon, magically move the mag to your bag, instantly fill the mag with bullets from the ammo case, and then move the mag back into your gun loaded and ready to fire with no animation whatsoever. 

There was a short period of time 2 years ago when taking a shot would literally rocket your screen vertically and it was close to impossible to return fire if you had taken a shot. 

I don’t think the current implementation of the mechanics you have described are good or “realistic” but saying it’s never felt worse or unrealistic is a bit of an exaggeration. 

I agree recoil and stamina need to be looked at overall.

Inertia is not realistic but previously being able to run from room to room in dorms and whipping your character around to peek and shoot was not healthy."
bufandatl,"I like to quote Pestily from 2018 (or was it later not sure). „Forget about the realism crap. It’s a video game but a highly immersive one.“

BSG should drop that realistic in their marketing and put immersive there. And then we can work around that."
P0werEdge,"On my last visit in Las Vegas Battlefield Vegas(range)i did shot a bunch of weapons in full auto

MP5, M4A1, AK etc they have really an incredible selection to shoot with.

At 150 feet or 45ish meters i could land with MP5 0 mods all stock 15+ bullets in a man size target with full auto without any training with MP5 or even shooting before that platform or shooting FULL auto as my country where i live does not allow that.

M4A1 is a sweet linear shouting gun that barely has any recoil also 15+ rounds on target, no experience before 0 mods etc

AK same story very mild recoil a bit more jumpy than M4 but still very manageable.

So if a peasant that shot all of its shooting time pistols and single shot rifles and sometimes shotguns could achieve this performance on stock guns with no experience on these platforms before then tarkov is just more arcade than COD at this point and has absolutely nothing realistic about recoil or anything else."
Mindset_,"Lmao this guy is actually upvoted after claiming he can run with an 80lb pack for 10 miles, delusional"
mushroom911,"It's mostly just an issue with mechanics being overtuned.
Recoil is this way cus they wanted mods to be more impactful and that allowed for literal laserbeam guns, so they nerfed rcl in general and now ur gun sucks without 300k in mods.
You used to be able to run on minced meat legs after eating buckshot in both kneecaps so premed meta ruined firefights for me. The stamina burn is a bandaid patch on that. Stamina cost on unprone and crouch is to fight dolphin diving. All of these things need tuning and tbh stamina burn from gunshots needs t be something else. We need an adrenaline system, but not one that allows people to run away after i blow their legs off."
xFKratos,"So first of all i agree with many of your points but. 

Can we ffs stop arguing with REALISM its fucking dumb and serves literally no purpose. How about instead we argue with gameplay reasons.

Realism arguments are easily turned around and you will be stuck in an endless cycle. And we are talking about a game and not real life."
M-Gnarles,"Recoil system is probably their way of longer TTK and introduce ""skill"" under the cover of ""realism"" when in reality, all they had to do was slightly buff /un-nerf body armor, and make penetration ammo scarce in a good way. 

They are doing the ammo things now (not the way I would have, but at least they try).   
The recoil needs to be lower and body armor 5 points better across the board imo.   


Then we can hit more accurately, without having a TKK that doesnt allow for engagement past the first burst."
SuperToxin,"It’s still a video game first, “realism” second"

Wess-L,"The recoil is like this so nolifes can grind for modded guns and lower recoil stats.
It does not reward skill just grind. Major reason why I don't play this game.
Personally love early wipe were everybody is rocking shit guns and gear. That's when the so called Chad's get their ass handed to them without their advantages. 
This game is not hard. Just a grind. Hence why people get tired of it and can't be asked to play every wipe.
Amazing concept. Poor balancing and optimization is killing this game. Nikita rather make a new map than put time in actually adding things like good sound.
I hope a tripple a just yoinks this concept and makes something better. Nikita just here to claim the eod sales. They put the minimum effort in this game."
whatchaknowsean,"One thing people don’t understand is the game isn’t at all realistic. Adding all the changes they did since 12.12 to make the game terrible like the inertia, recoil, stamina, and weight changes etc and people defend it in the name of “realism” is dumb. I’ve played since 2018 and I had so much fun with the game up until 12.12. The movement felt great, the recoil was realistic, the stamina and weight system that was in the game was perfect dynamic loot didn’t plague loot across the maps and we could literally leave the raid with weapon cases and keycards in wallets and most importantly the game was FUN. Cause that’s what tarkov is it’s a video game. It’s not realistic at all. Sure before 12.12 when we didn’t have inertia ADAD spam was annoying but the problem with that was desync/net code because you couldn’t see someone sometimes and it’s something  which they refused to fix. But atleast we were able to have 100% control over our PMC’s which made gunfights last longer as well as make it up to us the player to move around. Now with inertia if you get in a close quarters fight you have to glide around and hope you can make it to cover in time. With Recoil being how unrealistic it is it’s not even satisfying to win fights anymore. The amount of times I will spray at someone and my gun jumps to the ceiling and I get one lucky spread to someone’s head knowing I had nothing to do with it makes the game not satisfying at all. With the armor system being how it is as well you can’t take more than 2 bullets even with level 6 due to blunt damage WHICH NEEDS TO BE REMOVED ASAP. Honestly if they reverted to anything below 12.12 I would be happy. This game hasn’t been fun at all in the last year. Hopefully they actually make changes they probably won’t but if they do it will definitely be next wipe and it probably won’t be anything significant."
MangledCarrion,A post that aged well
PretzelsThirst,"The recoil is atrociously stupid in this game for all the reasons you described, and for the fact it grabs control out of your hands so you can’t combat the shitty recoil effectively. There is a good reason no other game uses this system, it only makes sense in theory, not in practice. 

A lot of tarkovs difficulty comes from bad game design"
armrha,"You can flat out run 10 miles with an 80 lb ruck? You are significantly fitter than most infantry OSUT graduates. No more than 60 lbs in the ruck, and iirc the run was 5 miles. A 12 mile rough terrain march that included marching up a damn creek..."
MrPigeon2a,"The reason why you can't sprint and jump anymore is because more than half the community bitched about this game being like ""COD"" years ago, they'd get pushed hardcore and outplayed by people skilled with movement and pathing in this game, so they decided to add inertia and overtuned it so bad i start hearing about more and more people wanting to go back to ""the good old days"" like some of these people didn't bring this upon themselves by complaining so hard.
Imo there should be a balance between the two, I'd say let your PMC run for at least 50% longer than currently and be able to loot a good 5 or 6 more kilos before he moves around like a snail from one point of the map to the other because he's overweight.
Having a car battery in your backpack and almost nothing else except from your rig and gun shouldnt get you to have to stop and prone every 10 seconds to recover because your pmc's lung are failing and turning to mush"

Conserliberaltarian,"Nikita knows very well what he wants the finished product to look like, and he's told us many times. The Raid series was created to showcase what he wants Tarkov combat to feel like. He's told us many times that he wants the game to be as realistic as playable. 

The problem is, Nikita is project lead, he does very little actual devolopment now a days, as he's the lead of a team of over 100 people. He assigns tasks to certain teams, and I don't think enough of his attention is paid to actually testing the game in it's current state to see if it meets his expectations. There are mechanics that exist in the game now that are in stark contrast to the way Nikita said he wants the game to play in the past. 

I'd give anything to see Nikita take a week off of work, and stream Tarkov for 8 hours a day that entire week. I'd like to see him actually expirence the product he's been working on for the last 5+ years, and I'd like to see his reaction to the way the game feels to play."
Vjekov88,"I don't understand why people keep mentioning realistic because in gameplay, realistic doesn't mean good. You have to decide what kind of gameplay you strive for and then design gameplay features to fit that idea. So either you're going for arcade gameplay or a simulation route.

If this game was realistic then we would spend up to 12 hours minimally in a single raid."
BigDickBaller93,"I can tell.you have never actually fired anything by ""a pistol at 20 metres hitting where you aim without any effort"" Anybody who has ever shot a pistol will tell you they are inaccurate as balls

eyedrib,"Short answer is no, they aren’t going for that level of realism. At the end of the day, this is still a game and a game has limitations. Yes, you can run with weight for 10 miles IRL, but the game isn’t designed to have maps that large. Same goes for hydration and energy. If raids lasted 10 hours and maps were miles long, ok sure but 1) no one wants that and 2) no one can build that with today’s tech. It’s a balance of scale and fun.

That being said, yes I agree the reasonable portions of “realism” like the recoil and audio etc are fucked and can/should be fixed."
CBHPwns,"I have an unpopular opinion but I kind of enjoy the fucked up recoil. A margin of players can already one tap like demons, it just adds a bit more opportunity to not instantly die if you get full auto dumped. From a realism standpoint? Yeah terrible. From a gameplay perspective? I am not opposed to it. 

Tarkov does have realism as its selling point and it implements aspects very well but imo at the end of the day and at its core, its an mmorpg shooter first and a realistic inspired shooter second"
Traditional-Monk4098,"Lost me at ""In real life I can run 10 miles with an 80lb ruck"", no you can't and if you are, you're an idiot. You sound like a boot and I didn't even need to read the rest."

ElectricalMTGFusion,"i forgot who said it, but someone said ""Tarkov is realistic if the pmcs in the game are actually the gamers who have never stepped outside, gone to the gym, or fired a gun""

RazielDKoK,"Yeah, you're right, the only thing that really bothers me is the recoil, the rest I chalk it up as just game systems, it is a game, devs wanted stamina and food/water system, its not implemented perfectly, but I don't see how to implement it better without it being obsolete. The only thing I'd say is dying from hunger is silly, you should just get a debuff to strength and stamina, not die after 5 min, that's ridiculous. Still I'm enjoying the game a lot."

_SteveRambo,"I played like 6 hours this wipe before giving up. The entire movement and gunplay system just feels like ass to handle. Late games feel pretty awful, and early wipe guns are borderline unusable. Pretty much every gunfight that I had when I played this wipe (other than when I used mosin) felt like a huge mess.

So many issues with the game have such obvious solutions that nobody in their right mind would disagree with. The fact that BSG haven't implemented changes for a lot of these issues means they are either willingly ignorant, or physically incapable of making the changes. I don't know which one is worse."

Padouch1038,"IMO the energy and hydration can be removed, I dont think even a nornal person would need to drink 2 bottles of water in 30 minutes and eat an entire MRE when going out.
If you leave the stamina as it is, just decrease the amount needed to crouch and stand up that would be great. I mean tactical sprint is about being fast moving cover to cover not a marathon.
The recoil.. I have few hundred rounds fired with different guns, and never seen any gun give me such a headache. Not even Mosin, and I thought its gonna be so strong. M4 is a laser pointer, .45ACP pistol and Submachine guns are easily controllable. Trained soldier or just a person with some experience will never have these issues continuesly firing. 
There is realism, and there is something we call artificial difficulty"
mihaeagle3,I think you just solved the puzzle: pmcs are just Nikita. He's the 500 lb mall cop with no recoil control
Normal-Surprise5492,Holding W is running. Holding shift is sprinting. You absolutely cannot sprint with an 80lbs ruck for more than a minute without heaving over and dying
Kooky-Scallion7896,"I see the reason for recoil. The first time I shot a 9mm handgun I could barely hit anything past 20 yards. My friend who had a couple hundred rounds fired could reliably hit a target at 50 yards away though. In my opinion we should see recoil like it is now for player scavs, which would largely be civilians that never picked up a gun. Then for PMCs it should be way easier because they are supposedly trained"
Kulson16,The game would feel better if we were to play as civilian trapped in tarkov rahter than pmc
FACEIT-InfinityG,"Realism cannot come infront of enjoyable gameplay. There needs to be a nice balance of when to stretch the realism for the sake of fun to keeping it in check so that the game does not turn into an unrealistic COD clone

As an example of one "" realism "" aspect change i hate with a passion is the inability to lay down in a bush directly and run through bushes and i feel it offered nothing to the game as a whole.

I would have just increased stamina drain through bushes not ground players to a halt through them. 

I guess the issue here is we all have different opinions and none of us are wrong, i just wish Nikita would implement a few of the ones where we all actually agree.

People are going to quote you Veritas video and its true he makes some great points articulated well but in his final montage you can see how the gunplay and recoil was non existant on the AS-Val and everything was a pure lazer beam.

Look I know we are playing a video game, I don’t want everyone to beam me from Narnia but I also would like to be able to actually shoot at people without looking at the Fucking sky. I was trying to shoot an AK the other day with a Valday on it, I kitted this gun out spent like 300k on it or less than that doesn’t matter, to then just die when I’m trying to tap fire because my scope goes black after 3 consecutive shots or if I want to full auto I just have to hope a bullet lands because after the first 5 shots my crosshair is just black and I can’t see what I am shooting at. That isn’t fun nor does it make me want to play, I love this game but the devs seem so blind to it, I want them to livestream them playing the game just for one whole day because I bet they would think wtf is this shit. I do really enjoy the changes they make and I do think we shit on then far too often but when I paid £140 for a video game I would say I have a right to complain, a new pair of sneakers can cost less often. The changes they have made for the most part like bringing out streets etc. I am really grateful for and if any devs or anyone reads this you do a fantastic job on bringing out new things etc. we just need to get the basics right and we have a great game. Anyhow rant over, still love Tarkov for the most part and will play it until someone makes something better or the game dies."

ConradIronmonger,"Escape From Tarkov is a great game, except everything related to combat system, including, recoil, inertia, AI, sound, stamina, cheaters and even price of the gear. At this point i can't blame extract campers, they just people who want to play a great game, but refuse to participate in it's dogshit, nonsense mess of game mechanics and features. Combat system is just garbage, probably one of the worst i've ever seen, especially considering the amount of work been put in to balancing and developing this part of the game."
Omxn,It’s a game with realistic aspects.
Runb4its2late,All valid but idk if I agree on stamina.. realistically you're correct but also needing to balance for gameplay. Don't need people sprinting the entire match.. it slows things down intentionally. Maybe some tweaks
GamersGen,"Never was, hence its rpg based game, meaning you progress with 'stuff' and things getting better, otherwise you would play another call of duty clone. I think :)"

Indianajones1989,It's a gear focused rpg unfortunately. It's not even an fps. Don't ever ever think your lifetime of fps experience and skill will help you in a fight. Think of this as a lord of the rings game. The armor is special enchanted wizard armor and your gun is a stolen special enchanted dark lord weapon with buffs and debuffs. Except in cases of complete incompetence the mathematically better set up will win 1v1 every time. Of all the endless laughable criminal shortcomings of this game the food and water pisses me off the most. I want the play the mother fucking game not baby sit my pmc whom can do literal surgery on himself while standing and then truck on but if his tummy gets hungi he'll fucking drop dead even though it's only been thirty minutes since he's eaten and entire military ration meant to last a whole day. In actual survival games with maps the size of small irl counties and base building you don't eat as much food as you do in this fucking game.
agentannanavarre,They implemented the stamina of new recruits from the Russian army. In this sens it's realistic. And maybe the recoil is ducked up because they did most of the testing high on vodka. Realistic too imo. This game is loosing core players but attracts new ones from twitch hype. So the sales might be high too. It will not go anymore into the realistic direction. Casual weirdness is what will bring more money to Nikita. Don't expect this game to get better.

ProfessionalSpinach4,"I have absolutely no military training at all, and when I go to the range with my AK, it does not go straight up. My 9mm does, because there’s no point of brace, but any game does this. They exaggerate recoil on automatic weapons because of “balance”"
burgunfaust,"I think that it's never even been about realism or milsim at all.

Take the med system for example. It's designed to reward shift w playstyles. Why? Because that is generally more enjoyable to watch on twitch and YouTube. If everyone played this game realistically,as though you have a single life, then everyone would rat and nobody would watch the game on those platforms. The only reason people enjoy watching rat players on twitch is because there are chads running around for them to pop. 

But I can't recall the last time that I broke a bone, slapped an instant splint on it, and got back in the game. Why? Because my fucking leg is broken so I can't fucking run!

Realism would mean a rattier experience all around. Anything else is a video game."
kentrak,"> Stamina is broken. I'm closer to a mall cop then a PMC specialist. In real life I can run with an 80lb ruck for 10 miles, in Tarkov I can jog for 40 seconds before I'm so gassed I need to stop. If I sit down or lay down, getting up costs me 10% of my stamina, apparently because I'm actually 500lbs.

Stamina is broken, but your example doesn't make sense.  You aren't just *running*, you're *sprinting* (look at the key bind in settings), so running flat out as fast as you can.  Taken in that respect, the stamina meter makes some sense, but it's still kinda whack.

Full speed ""walk"" (a jog) needs to be made faster (maybe 202-30%) so it's a jog, and half speed regular movement needs to be made more of a ""walk"" with a much reduced noise.  Jogging should still let you regain stamina, but slower than an actual walk.  Sprinting should maybe use water a lot faster, and maybe allow going into the negative for a bit (at a reduced speed that gets slower the more negative you go) for a reduced stamina recovery rate for a longer period the more negative you go.  i.e. you can push yourself when you need it, but you'll pay for it."

NimbleBrando,This is literally a regurgitated copy paste of Veritas' god awful video. Every single point you made is from the video...
Wiuwiu3333,"While I have not played more than 2 wipes now so Im fairly new and only few hundred hours, but last and this wipe I have quit game for similar reasons. Its just too annoying to play the game. After few hours of playing in last wipe I realized way too many annoying inconvenient things which could be easily solved and made more enjoyable to play. For example inspecting items like bullets, armor or weapons etc do not give proper explanation and will only confuse player and forces them to go youtube or wiki to memorize all info to play effectively or have things on 2nd monitor. 

Well could manage this but then the UI/Menu is essentially designed by someone who is not really putting any thought how to make it. When ever software is designed its developers job to make sure that UI / menus are easy and fast for user to use. No one wants to use systems that are annoying to use.

Ppl who want to believe tarkov is realistic are delusional. Ultimately tarkov is video game and should adapt things from realism, but not try to copy them 1:1.

In reality many things are dull and boring and outright something that hardly any gamer desires. 

Way to adapt something from realism is something like this: Ok human can slide into cover. Ok lets add sliding into game but make sure it cannot be utilized to gain better movement like CoD slide movement cancel. But often times I hear ppl not wanting game to be like CoD but I see CoD more realistic.

Better movement, animations, vaulting etc.

While Tarkov is clunky, annoying and inconvenient to play."

NimbleBrando,"You're complaining about recoil (even though most meta built guns have very low recoil) but you don't talk about how PMC's can stand/crouch and literally hold a perfectly steady gun out to 300+meters, and I mean literally perfect like zero sway at 300m while STANDING UP.

If you don't realize that game mechanics like stamina and food/water are put in the game to balance it and make it dynamic than you are clueless for someone with 5 wipes of Kappa.

Traditional-Pause-20,"Usually people complain about the game in an annoying way, but as someone who has been playing since 2018, I cannot help but completely agree with you on the state of the game."
inVain3219,"You’re right, the game was never geared realistic as possible but realistic as playable. I don’t know this for certain, but I’d imagine the changes to recoil and stamina are for balancing reasons. I don’t want guns to shoot like lasers and I’d imagine most other players would feel the same. If pistols were more actuate, we’d probably see a lot of people just running 18c’s or 5.7’s as a budget, but effective, build. Being tagged and cursed is a way to prevent hatchet Timmys. The stamina is a bit more obscure on its purpose. Perhaps they want to more a heavier emphasis on leveling talents. We have a gym in our hideout this wipe, so maybe this isn’t a stretch. 
At the end of the day, it’s their game. They can make whatever changes they want to the game, even if it ruins it (looking at you World of Warcraft)."

Same if you had to maintain a realistic sleeping schedule. If it was realistic your PMC would just 'know' about urban combat tactics and how to clear rooms etc and would do so without any player input. Where do you draw the line? It's arbitrary. It's supposed to be tough but it still has to be a game. Balancing that is clearly not easy."

Aceylah,"Hit every point dude. Nice post. I honestly don't think the game can be considered realistic ever, especially with the RPG mechanics. I'd rather they focus on an enjoyable experience."
Admiral_Thrawn_7,"The stamina drain from getting up from prone or crouch is literally the most laughable thing over ever seen a video game. I can squat 350 lbs for multiple reps in real life, but if I crouch and uncrouch a few times with a 120 lbs worth of gear I reach my limit and I’m out of breath in the game.

Getting shot should slow you down initially depending on where it hit but most of the time you shouldn’t be incapacitated by a bullet. I know people who got shot before. One of my coworkers whos in his 30s how, when he was younger he was driving through a bad neighborhood and some gangbangers opened fire at his car shooting him in the leg, he kept driving until he drove himself to the hospital. He said the pain wasn’t that bad until after.

When getting shot at and it drains your stamina to the point where you’re a sitting duck, just accepting your fate and waiting to die, that’s pathetic and not how it works in real life at all.

I am not even going to touch on the recoil system, let alone the fact that 90% of the gunfights the flash and smoke from the gun in conjunction with the camera recoil makes it impossible to see your target if they have moved a bit, meaning that unless you drop them in the first couple shots, full auto literally ONLY works at under 10 meters, in a bright daylight.

I made all these points 2 wipes ago over multiple posts for each individual issue and I was completely shut down by most of the community. I was down voted and received so much hate for “wanting Tarkov to be like Call of Duty”. And “I should just go play Call of duty as this game is the for me”.

Watching Veritas’s video made me realize how more realistic COD LOOKS and feel, like literally if they added healing animations, removed the above to bunny hop and shoot in the air, removed the constant sliding, the game would literally be more realistic than Tarkov on so many levels. So yeah I wish Tarkov was a little bit more like COD in some ways. At least in that game you can vault over objects and not be blocked by a 3 inch step, and I can mount my gun on a wall instead of draining all my arm stamina when there’s a perfectly fine wall I can use to sit my gun right in front of me.

I’m glad these things are at least getting some traction due to Veritas cause I pointed these things out I was told I was crazy"

AdditionalPut7748,"I have to disagree with you about firing a fully automatic weapon. Many people have never fired one in real life as they’re hard to come by and manufacturers/people with a manufacturers license are the only people able to carry one. I’ve shot one once, and it isn’t not easy to control but I think it’s silly in this game that the penalty for tapping over full auto is almost worse. Tapping the trigger should have very accurate recoil control, not worse than full auto. I think they have the guns pretty well down but there is a LOT of room for improvement. I don’t think this game is meant to be played by people who can’t grind 5+ hours a day. The whole mechanics and skill system in the game literally gives people who can play more a tactical advantage. I literally can’t even buy enough good ammo to keep up. It’s my fault I work 10 hours a day that I can’t enjoy this game to its full potential. This game almost goes past realism, it’s like hyper realistic at this point. Almost like dayz, running out of stamina or hunger in seconds. It’s almost too much…"

JVTAO,"The whole post is hilarious

I don't like recoil too, but I am happy with that, I think is not realistic, but it has been nerfed in order to balance PvP.

Do you remember AS VAL meta? That weapon recoil was much realistic in that time, but every body played that, and PvP was more boring imo. Then after nerf, people switched to m4a1 HK for example, and again. So I think this is the main reason why we have this kind of recoild today. I am not sure if is the best solution but I enjoy, mostly all of the time I just try to play at single shots, and only using full auto at cqc  


\+1 with Stamina"
Comprehensive_Fee_23,"Sounds to me like you stopped enjoying Tarkov altogether and you should either take a break or find some other game to play.

While constructive criticism is good, it looks like there isn't a single Tarkov thing that you enjoy anymore, and I doubt that it took you 5 years to realise that you simply hate some of the mechanics like jumping over something, for example. And no, you can't sprint for 16KM with a 40kg backpack on you. Not when you had time to do 5 Kappas in a row.

The game is far from perfect but fucking hell, where is all of this hate coming from, all of a sudden?

I will speculate but it honestly feels that it's mostly veteran players longing for ""the good old days"", filled with nostalgia for the times where they could slap Timmies all day, where not so many things about the game were common knowledge, no Wiki or readilly available information about the game. I'm gonna say it. This is what happens to the average skill level of the playerbase, when a game goes mainstream.

I honestly don't get it. Yes, audio is worse than last wipe and they addressed it, said it's gonna be fixed. But other than this, what is the problem all of a sudden? 

Are you seriously complaining about the Food system? Everyone sprinting all over the place and chugging painkillers every 5 minutes and it's hard to understand why you have to eat something if you stay a bit longer in a raid. You do realise that 1 minute irl is not 1 minute in Tarkov, as seen on the clock @ map selection. What do you want, to make food even more worthless than it already is? To eat every 3 raids?

All in all, the recent amounts of hate and over-exagerated criticism is actively hurting the game that we love. Imagine you just heard of the game and were thinking of buying it, but decide to check reddit first."

I think you made some good point and I wonder why BSD seems to turn a deaf ear to players feedback. I mean you're developing a game in open beta but don't listen the player base.   
Also a lot seems to be made to counter hackers and real money trading with little effect others than penalized legit players.

FairFlays,"Nikita said a lot of times he hates meta. Irl meta exists (m4 or ak weapon). There are general good weapons or bases and there are situational ones.
So by fixing meta and making all guns equal (shit), he is making steps toward no realism, but ""balance""."
Zegger8914,"Having either the option of using an m4 on single fire and always breaking my sight alignment after one shot or having to waste way too much money on full auto is really not fun for me.  And when I do land hits, i'm somewhat bad at games so landing headshots is not as easy, and having to either land a headshot or go for the legs or pray after hitting their chest 15 times and not doing any visible or audible damage is stupid.  Thank god I was never shot st nut I can imagine, at the very least it would do some sort of impact, but it honestly feels like I am the weakest person alive, everyone else is a supersoldier and my guns and rainbow ammo doesn't work.  If it is trying to be realistic or if it is trying to not be realistic, both are equally stupid and frustrating to play.

I only had some positive reaction to this game at the start of a wipe when no one has pimped guns and pmc levels because everyone is at a struggle.  A few days in and the game is unfair and unfun.  There is no justification to have a game you can only play for 3 days in 3 months"
