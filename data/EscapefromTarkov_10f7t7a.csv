Muhawi,Knowledge should be FREE and not hidden behind a subscription! This is an amazing map and we're very excited to be able to supply the community with the fully fledged interactive version of it on the wiki soonTM.
woap,"You the MVP man, i prefer all your maps over others !"
tacobellisdank,Your maps have been my favorite maps ever since I discovered them.
ReturnOfTheJuJu,Jindouz - I have been looking for your *ss for ages now trying to thank you! I've pretty much only used your maps over any other. They're brilliantly made! Thanks again and keep up the good work!
re3mr,God tier like always

Incrediblebulk92,"Maps like this make me think that there should actually be 50 PMC spawns with a load of randomisation. At least 3 possible spawns between each PMC on the maps. 

The spawns near abandoned house and signal zone are whack. Cornered between 3 pmcs."
IMCIABANE,Great contribution. Big thanks
aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,Crazy how little there is inside places other than just hallways.
D3_BellDropper69,Huge W!!! Good work team!
Full-Ad-4982,Doing gods work son
7r4pp3r,"Your doing gods work.

Solrstorm,Love your clean and easy to read map layouts. Doing gods work out here with these maps.
K4MP3R1984,Awesome!!!
Katie_xoxo,adore your maps. thank you !!!
Cristian_995,"Very nice work, good to see a greatly detailed map with accurate information on the wiki."
xVello,"Great map, a tiny adjustment could be indicating that the hallway is blocked 1F Chekannaya St. building, forcing you to go around through the kitchen to get to the stairs leading up."
Madzai,I must say that PMC spawns below Cinema is pure BS.
eodFox,"Underpass is missing. 0/10. Totally unusable.

just kidding great work. There is loot in underpass (one green create iirc)."
Synchrotr0n,"Speaking of maps, it's absurd that a game with as many players as Tarkov has such gatekept information about loot locations, but I'm glad to see that this might be changing with the effort people are putting in the wiki."
Z0EBZ,"Oh fuck, that looks good. I'm still waking up and need coffee but this looks amazing!"
DJDemyan,"Doing gods work, thank you!"
_d3vnull_,"Insane good work, thank you!"

Datdarnpupper,"Great work, thanks for sharing!"
silveredge7,Thank you very much. Any way we can support your work? ðŸ˜Š
Eurekify2,Too bad thereâ€™s no subterranean sections of the map. Thatâ€™s what makes maps like Reserve so much better
azfeels,Is the map still rubber bandy? I want to play it but after watching livestreams from wipe thereâ€™s no way I would be happy trying to learn the new map while rubber banding around
Freduccine1,"Hi, is this a new update that has recently been added or is this an upcoming update? Also what about the rubber banding during raid?"
stylussensei,typo on Sadovaya Street
Deericious,"Wait, you guys can even play this map?"
