EyeLikeTheStonk,How is this fiscally responsible to stop paying your bills?
imakeholesinu,Last 3 financial Crisis have come under Republican House Majorities.
mypoliticalvoice,">We could soon be facing the biggest financial crisis in history as Republicans ***once again*** threaten to stop paying America's bills

I fixed it for you."
Particular-Court-619,These threats have happened plenty of times before.  But the new breed of Rs buys into their own delusions more than Rs of the past.  So chances of it happening this time are higher than ever.
Gonkar,"The party of ""FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY"" doesn't want to pay the bills. In before media outlets blame the Democrats."
FlatulentWallaby,The GOP will happily burn the country to the ground just to spite Biden.
GeoHubs,"Biden needs to trot out the 14th amendment which says, ""Section 4.
The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned."""
taez555,"Biggest financial crisis in history caused by the Republicans, *so far*."
ChicagoThrowaway422,"I'm grateful that the White House isn't coddling the GOP children anymore.  They need to grow the fuck up and participate in the modern world.

Unfortunately, the GOP is going to cause a lot of pain as they throw this temper tantrum.  But after 12 years of this, enough is enough."
Eric_in_America,"This perfectly illustrates the infantilism of the Republican party. 



I've noticed that you can boil most Republican talking points, behaviors and attitudes down to what an insufferable child might typically say or do

The obvious example here is the Republican effort to hold the American economy hostage and demand a ransom, it's a petty, disingenuous, crude ultimatum, it's juvenile, its even a little vindictive, just like their determination to investigate and vilify the Biden family. This is while they've spent the last four years vehemently pushing back against any investigation into Trump, crying persecution at every opportunity, it essentially amounts to ""oh yeah!? Well we can investigate you too!"". Another obvious example would be election denying, ""if I win, I won fairly, if I lost, you cheated"", that's about as childish as it gets.

Conservatives rely heavily on petty whataboutism/deflection tactics and rationalizations that often amount to ""he/she/they did it first!"", typically used as a means to justify their actions or behavior, as a means to vindicate themselves or discredit the other side, the investigation... 

Think about fervent calls to impeach or investigate Biden, think about what's going on right now with Biden's classified materials case, how they conflate two entirely different circumstances so that they can justify one with the other, how they deliberately ignore context, details, facts of the matter in order to push a narrative or rationalize their actions. 

Think about how conservatives justify their election denying with unfounded and uninformed claims related to the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton, the Russia investigation, think about ""buh buh what about Hunter!?"". Think about how they might justify and downplay violence with a misguided ""what about _____"". Think about how they justify most of their reprehensible actions, even their own oppressive, antagonistic and discriminatory behavior with whataboutism or an unhealthy obsession with some left-wing boogeyman, while it's often to the effect of *two wrongs make a right*. I mean, were taught the opposite as children. 

Then there's the ""I know you are but what am I""  attitude, this one is very common amongst conservatives. ""No, *you're* the racist"", ""*you're* the tyrant"", ""*you're* violent"", ""*you're* corrupt"" ""*you're* destroying the country"", ""*you're* brainwashed"", ""*you're* fake news propaganda"", while good ol fashion projection is an all too common practice for Republicans. 

Don't forget their vehement aversion towards sharing with others even though it's a lesson drilled into us when we're young that, and mind the tacky aphorism for a moment, ""sharing is caring"". I mean for fuck's sake, It's literally what Jesus would do!

In the same vein, there's the idea that because they had to live through something, everyone else should be made to suffer through it too. Again, also very childish. Similarly, sometimes it comes to ""if I can't have it, you cant either""... 

The whole ""it's not fair!"" narrative is a popular one. A lot of these people don't understand the full extent of oppression and discrimination, many cannot truly relate to those that have experienced veritable oppression, injustice and abuse, yet argue that they're now one of the most suppressed and persecuted groups in this country. It's fucking wild, racism is ubiquitous now where they were unwilling to acknowledge it before, but only if it's in the form of anti-white discrimination, only if they can be the aggrieved, the ones cowering at its sharp end

It's as if Republicans won't be happy until they're made a protected class. In their eyes, equality is oppression, accountability is persecution, their reality is turned upside down by these very simple ideas, just as a child might lash out when they stop receiving preferential treatment. 

Victims, these types are always victims, like a temperamental child who can't handle some fleeting anxiety over the reality that they can't always get what they want. Incessantly grieving, griping and outraged, always victims, ever persecuted, censored and suppressed by their would-be oppressors, always twisting the circumstances around to convey that they're the wounded party. 

What's more, whenever an act of political violence occurs, and it's some right wing nutjob behind it, or some mentally unstable person who has been radicalized by far right ideals, conspiracies and propaganda, it's almost always either a false flag, a cover up, or some deeper conspiracy. How convenient right? The party of personal responsibility can't seem to... Take responsibility. 

Every time, every god damn time we see right wing violence, it's turned into a conspiracy of some sort, or it's downplayed, whitewashed, like these people are fucking blameless, perfect, incapable of wrongdoing, which is an egregiously absurd notion, it also helps them lay the blame on others, and again, this is exactly how a child behaves/thinks

While many of them are just bullies. Unwarranted aggression, confrontation, judgement, they'll sometimes stigmatize and belittle, resort to name-calling, they'll act spiteful and vindictive, they'll try and disguise it, but what they're really trying to mask are their insecurities. I mean, most of us can be judgemental from time to time, but entirely without warrant is a different story, and often just because someone who's typically doing no harm to themselves or others has different views and values or lives a different lifestyle. 

I've also noticed that some conservatives tend to resort to ad hominem attacks, personal insults and petty retorts when their views are challenged, failing to address the argument, the claim, the facts or reasoning.

Republicans also tend to be very cliquish, where the groups and communities that they form and identify with tend to influence their behavior and actions immensely. Leading to things like groupthink, herd or mob mentality, conditioning, homogeneity.

And like a child who indiscriminately rejects anything that might challenge what they believe in or what argument they're trying to make, these conservatives blindly disregard and dismiss all information that threatens their worldview, their argument or narrative, while on the other hand, they gravitate towards and mindlessly embrace whatever information confirms their biases, their pre-conceived views and their prejudices. 

Entitled, insufferable children, not all of them, but all too many of them."
Akimbo_Zap_Guns,I mean leading up to the election they literally said this is what they would do and people still voted them in. SMH people
bop999,"They will rider the fix to some abhorrent social change (like slashing voter rights) or slashing social programs, then try to blame the Democrats for not compromising."
Popculturemofo,"This is the result of the GOP’s one and only goal to “own the libs”

They literally don’t give a fuck about anything else beyond being an irritant to everyone who isn’t a hard line right winger"
PlantainCreative8404,"A GOP representative just made a statement on the floor that Americans don't want social security, they want to work until they're 90. Says the man in his $5,000 suit pulling in hundreds of thousands in dark money donations from shady russian oligarchs.

The GOP is a criminal gang focused on the destruction of America."
Umgar,"It's so infuriating listening to Republicans use terrible analogies to explain the debt ceiling ""debate."" I heard a clip of McCarthy saying it's like a child maxing out their credit card, and then asking for the limit to be increased, and then you keep increasing the limit.

EXCEPT THATS NOT WHATS HAPPENING AT ALL

The money is already spent. This is just part of paying the bill, and not supposed to be anything other than a perfunctory and automatic part of that process.

It's just so enraging to hear him and other Republicans spin these bullshit tales about how all this works because you 110% know that Fox News is not going to call him on the bullshit and explain to their viewers how the debt ceiling truly works, what its function is, and why all of this is theatrical nonsense that carries very real risk. The last debt ceiling ""crisis"" in 2011 ultimately cost the US government ***11 billion dollars***. Party of fiscal responsibility my ass."
LostSailor-25,I think Republicans are going to be in for a surprise on how this plays out. This isn't 2011. People know what this game is about. The blame will fall on the Republicans.
Ok-Beautiful-8403,Nothing says fiscally conservative like not paying your bills
spacebetween22,They will find a way to blame dems.
ReverseMoses,Republicans always ruin the economy. ALWAYS.
Reid0072,"""Republican leaders and not paying their debts"" - name a more iconic duo."
browster,Fuck this shit.  Invoke the 14th amendment and just pay everything as normal.
beeberweeber,No because big billionaire donors would torch the goppers who made us default. All the fortune 500 will literally send henchmen to deal with the gop if we defaulted.
Protolictor,"Didn't the Republicans cause the nation's credit rating to be lowered during the latter half of the Obama presidency while pulling this same shit?

Yup, just Googled it. 2011 S&P downgraded U.S. sovereign debt to AA+ from AAA+ with a negative outlook after the Republican controlled congress pushed this exact same shit long enough to make the financial folks nervous."
SodaPop6548,"I’ve said for years now, I’ll never understand how anyone could say with a straight face that republicans are better for the economy. 

Maybe if you only look at the Dow they make sense, but that is just symbolic of the wealthy and how they are doing."
JPal856,"So predictable.  America needs to move on from these tactics.  Time to just order the government to do normal business, ignore the law and let the courts deal with. I believe something in our Constitution says nothing can interfere with the full faith and credit."
,mint the trillion coin
CreatureThePirate,"It’s okay guys, this is just the THIRD time in TWELVE years that Republicans are trying to financially hold the Democratic government hostage through the debt ceiling.

Exactly how the government should be run! Using an artificial debt ceiling for your own political gain to cut spending that helps the people you are supposed to be representing! 

What a fucking shit show."
Dead_Cash_Burn,"The party of Hypocrisy. When they have a President in power they rack up debt with no problem. I guess they are happy to blame the dems later, that's their MO. If only more people would call them out. A rating downgrade will cost us millions. A default would literally break the world's financial system. The party of morons. They have no grasp of the consequences of their actions."
MeltStuff,The US and Denmark are the only democratic countries with a debt ceiling. Only one of them has political leaders that use it to their advantage…
drumzandice,Isn’t tanking the economy part of their plans so they can blame Democrats heading into elections?
longlive289s,"I am so very tired of Republican majorities in the house

Just jumping from one crisis to another due to their incompetency or reckless behavior"
gofigure85,Do they want things to go to shit so they can blame it on the Democrats?
PeaceFrog71x,"Republicans are going to cause this and then blame Biden. 

Source: history"
Barium_Enema,All of a sudden they are worried about the deficit again.  Where was all this concern while 45 cut taxes and greatly increased short and long-term deficits by greatly helping himself and the 1%?
Suspicious_Slide4643,Can we stop paying red welfare states first?
Royal_Classic915,The Donald would approve of not paying the bills
Darkhorseman81,"You have to realize that a lot of the current Republicans are strategic Russian assets who want to crash the global economy, in an attempt to disrupt the Ukrainian support via increasing global economic instability.

A lot of these Republicans went on holidays in Russian Asset hot spots, to pick up drops and instructions from their handlers.

You need to watch a lot of the Far Right wing nuts closely. They aren't entirely what they appear to be. Some are run by Billionaire special interests, some are run by the Russians, some are being run by both."
Behind8Proxies,Don’t forget it was also the Republicans holding the debt ceiling hostage caused the US’s credit rating to drop.
PeaceBkind,Republicans had no issue with increasing our national debt in 2017/18 passing the orange traitors corporate tax cut. Ironic so many low income ppl actually vote them them
Musetrigger,"C'mon guys. Give them a break. All they want to do is cut Social Security and Medicare, rig elections for themselves and make America a Christofascist country."
OtakuAnthony,Mint the coin.
pixelburger,That would be unconstitutional - so no problem
eatmorechiken,Wait until they figure out if it affects there own finances-then they’ll take action.
Wiliva0202,Seems the putin puppets are hell bent on destroying the country from the inside......
Oonue,"They can threaten all they want, the same donors who finalized the speaker deal will be on their phones telling them exactly what will happen to their careers if they don't get this done."
ccasey,"It’s just one manufactured crisis after the next with the republicans, how do people not catch onto this?"
Nthepeanutgallery,"This is Republicans demonstrating yet again that they have no understanding of how the economy functions.  Small words for the small minds - This. Is. To. Pay. For. The. Stuff. You. Already. Agreed. To. Buy.  The budget was already passed - you want to play pissypants do it while working on the next budget. 

Children."
cheap90scigar,"Imagine last year you bought a house and car. Now this year, you’re looking at your budget and you decided not to make payments because you don’t like either. So you plan to let the house foreclose and the car to get repossessed. Next year, you find you need to buy a house and a car again, but you can’t figure out why you can’t get a loan. 


That’s basically what the GOP will attempt to do to the US this summer."
Odd-Frame9724,"Republicans dgaf about fiscal responsibility.  See Trump  administration.


Culture wars. Mah guns/gas stove/freedoms (but not freedom for women)"
bidofidolido,"The Fed is about to get the ultimate cure for inflation, a complete crash of the economy.

These Republican chucklefucks in the stupid caucus are hellbent on defaulting because they see intransigence and petulance as a badge of honor.  They're going to be in for a big surprise when seniors living on their IRA's and 401k's confront them about doing all this to cut social security AND crashing their retirement nest eggs.

Buckle up!  Don't have bond funds holding bills around those maturity dates, move your cash out of money markets and don't plan on touching your stock equities for a decade.

I don't see Democrats bailing them out and I don't see Republicans having enough people to avert this crisis.  Meanwhile, over in Moscow, Putin laughs at this clown show."
Loquater,Why do Republicans hate Americans so much?
Ghee_Guys,Dark Brandon needs to start calling these fuck faces out again. Do not let them bullshit and twist their way out of it.
CumOnEileen69420,"Alright everyone place your bets on the “barganing chip” the republicans will use for this.

Front runners currently are:

>	national don’t say gay bill

>	national trans healthcare bill

>	cutting funding for social security 

Some rising options include

>	privitisng the USPS (mail in ballots)

>	national voter ID

>	removing large portions of the voting rights act

And of course you can double your bet if you include “The dems get blamed for not compromising”"
rdaredbs,How many damned crises do we have to live through in 20 years? I’m tired
NotMyF777ingJob,It's almost like some people know republicans are shitty leaders.
Cglied,"Next time you vote, please remember that the only time these people care about Federal spending is when a Democrat is in office."
quirkycurlygirly,They need to stop fucking with our money. This shit ain't cute.
Medium-Complaint-677,"I'm sure the democrats will fail again but this is bully pulpit catnip. Every prominent democrat from the president, down through congress, to governors and mayors should be out there melting down the airwaves with the message ""republicans in the house are refusing to pay america's bills and the results will be absolutely disastrous for their base."" Over and over and over and over and over again. Go on Tucker Carlson. Go on OANN. Tweet it. Call a press conference. Hammer. It. Home."
AMC_Unlimited,"In response Biden should cut funding to red states just as trump did to “Sanctuary Cities”.

Its time for the “party of personal responsibility” to take responsibility for the people they elect."
codingclosure,They controlled both ~~houses~~ chambers and the president when Trump was elected and did nothing to reduce the national debt and only increased it. This needs to be on repeat.
MyNameIsRay,"Another GOP majority, another financial crisis.

It's almost like history repeats itself..."
cmgchamp2,"House Repubs:  Let's negotiate, ok?   You give us budget cuts that we get to pick and choose.....................and we'll agree not to default the US dollar, markets, and economy back to the stone age.   Okay?

Right Repubs?"
Kanguin,"At this point screw it, let everything crash and burn. Maybe once that happens, people will realize they Republicans can't seem to do anything but break things. I mean it probably wouldn't but one can hope."
sweazeycool,And somehow Democrats will be blamed.
noodles_the_strong,"Let em, let it burn, they think they got their clicks cleaned this election cycle, let's see what happens in 2 more years"
way2funni,"if they allow the deadline to pass, [it can affect our nation's credit rating.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_credit_rating)

The last time the GOP pulled this crap and [we went from AAA at AA+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_credit-rating_downgrades).

This was the first time the US Government has been rated less than AAA.

The next step down is AA and then AA -

Anything BBB- and up is still considered investment grade and going from AAA to AA or even AA- may not sound like a big deal but as anyone who has ever had to buy something on credit with a less than stellar rating has encountered the brutal reality that the cost of your loan and the best terms are reserved for the highest FICO scores.

It matters when you borrow the trillions upon trillions like we do. [The cost of servicing those loans is already 7% of all government spending in 2022](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/deficits-debt-and-interest#:~:text=When%20interest%20rates%20rise%20or,and%201.6%20percent%20of%20GDP) \- almost 400 Billion Dollars.

The cost of borrowing (interest rates) has already gone up - now compound that with a weaker credit rating and we could have a problem."
Aware_Material_9985,I mean they are the party of Trump and he is infamous for not paying his bills.
gary1979,"This is what Republican voters wanted!! Several more years of not getting anything done. Anything to own the libs. Sad. They will cut social security and Medicare, and their voters will believe them when they say it’s the democrats.

Boddhisatvaa,">Michael Strain, the director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank, wrote that the Biden administration and Democrats have to accept the reality that ""House firebrands"" are not bluffing about not reaching a deal.

House firebrands? That's a funny way to say economic terrorists. The Republicans might as well be saying, ""Say, that's a nice economy ya' got there. Be a shame if anything were to happen to it."""
stanthebat,"A financial crisis that was obviously deliberately engineered by Republicans might--MIGHT--make enough people stop voting for them to save the US from its current slide into fascism.  If not, I fear we have worse stuff to look forward to than a financial crisis."
mostlyfull,It’s like waiting for the restaurant bill to come after you’ve eaten and saying we’ll save money by not paying for this. How come the Republicans never attempt to balance the budget when they’re in power. It’s almost as if cutting corporate taxes to $0 doesn’t work.
breedersfuckoff,And it looks like the treasury is already fucking with the retirement of workers in public service and postal service. They need to be pulling the fucking income for congress members FIRST and I guarantee this issue would get solved. Why does everything come at the cost of the working class?
Catlenfell,Republican Recession has a nice ring.
apitchf1,"And then the “undecideds” whoever they are at this point. Would say, well it’s cause the Dems don’t compromise and/ or blame the president. I hate how the status quo is it’s a Dems fault, it’s what every uninformed person assumes first."

legion4it,What's it going to take for normal Americans to realize that the republican party is anti-American? They have no values and want to see the country fail and be destroyed.   This is a failed party and it has to be dismantled.  You can't negotiate with a disease.
