GammaSmash,"""Fuck outta here."""
graytheboring,GET DOWN MR PRESIDENT
Hakairoku,"Soulsborne tip

If you see an enemy with their back exposed and its just them, check your corners.

Another notable bait like this is the Silver Knight admiring a portrait in Anor Londo in DS1. That fucker has a bodyguard."
datsadpotato,That moment when youâ€™re going to be productive and depression slaps you out of it
QuadCoronet19,Ah yes a FromSoft classic. Have an enemy wonder over from off screen and just the right time to ruin your plans.
streamerboi1123,Away! Away!
Injushe,"""Clever girl."""
yousef-s-g,Bro wtf. I had a dream this morning that bloodborn had a sequel announcement. I was so excited and everything. But then I woke up.

noobplayer96,"""This one's mine, bitch!"""
Barl0we,"I'm pretty sure I did the same thing the first time I got there :D

""Nah I won't aggro that dude, I can attack the guy with his back turned first"" - famous last words."
Lettuce_is_a_pedo,Buddy just got clapped on an episode of :Pranked video game edition.
Lampshade_510,LMAO the guy at the end scared me
Ichiqo,60fps when?
Famout,"Ah yes, I love how Fromsoft so often encourages us to do a ""dick move"" and stab from behind, and then also manages to so often punish us for it too."
rachael-111,me every monday
jimbowymbo,Been there. Done that. I was waiting for him to be slammed from the right by the other ogre. Was not disappointed. One of the best games I have ever played.
Sylarxz,"""taste of your own medicine!"""
mikeyisgrim,I absolutely love bloodborne.  Such a dope game
ClankyBat246,Gaming with a headset is mandatory with these.
Whitealroker1,Clever girlâ€¦.
DR_TOXIC_ZW,I wish I had a friend like this lol
BiggsFaleur,Every DS/BB game has a moment like this that teaches you to never trust free opportunities haha. I still fell for this one.
Praise3The3Sun3,"My money was the crow getting you. Lol

That's a classic Miyazaki trap. Too obvious backstabbing opportunity. Multiple possible angles you might get ganked from in your blindspots."
mango_manreddit,Most fair fight in bloodborne:
taishiea,NO means NO!
Peazo,The one game in the collection that eludes many pc players like myself.
redconvict,"Exclusives are cancer. This game looks interesting but I would be forced to buy a DRM box if I were to ever play this one game. Worse than that is any game not deemed something companies can just keep selling you over and over with each gen will be left behind and never playable outside of the console it appeared on, even worse are digital only games that will die with the service unless brought back years later is some sort of benevolant act by the corporate over lords."
ishaanae,Game name pls

maglen69,Souls games in a nutshell.  Gotta have that situational awareness
Beilke45,"You can actually see the bird start to wake up in the grass to the left.

Souls games train you hard to always be careful and to look around every book and corner.

But that focus you get when faced with a target, it's so often bait."
Jack-Pumpkinhead,Welcome to FromSoftware games
Garlador,You could make a great meme out of this.
shadowdash66,Pauley get that fucker outta here!

daemon_panda,"I remember this part and started laughing way before it hit you. That is what you get for not looking

Edit: I too fell victim to this."
MaxStickies,Not just me when I did my first playthrough then.
Bn_scarpia,"I loved this moment in Bloodborne. It's perfectly crafted to troll you on multiple levels.

They set up an obvious crit/backstab opportunity against a kinda tough troll foe, but you have to be sneaky about it 

As you approach there's a hard-to-see dinky crow on the ground that can blow the sneak attack

and the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance is a literal troll comes up from your right and smashed you to smithereens.

This then allows the troll you were going to backstab to double team you until you are a spitroast on a BDSM channel.

*Chef's kiss*"
DemonHunter24,Dude was just protecting his buddy
Xunaun,"""...And *that's* when the attack comes, not from the front...but from the *side*..."""
MRorange1988,"""Bitch you thought!'"
smacky623,"I have played this game so many times, as I watched you walk up I was saying, ""The one on the right.  The one on the right."""

Evangelion217,Thank you FromSofware.
ughitsmeagian,Don't smack his GF's ass
NerdDexter,Where was this? I've beaten this game but don't remember these enemies/this area.
dbzmah,Pretty sure this taken from streamer Dunkys playthrough of BB
Sharpshooter188,"This is why I always watch out for ""obvious enemy with back turned."" FS has a nasty habit of making you think youre the ambusher when you aee actually the ambushee."
ArbitraryChaos13,Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.
TheOldManBee,Bruh got Falcon punched!
Mokari_Onedge,It reminds me of me preparing a university exam and forgetting about the other.

AdamSnipeySnipe,r/getdownmrpresident
Patricia_Star_Bl,That escalated quickly..
theghostsforever,They need to make a sequel to this game. The best Souls game hands down. Tried the Elden Ring trial and it felt like the same old.
