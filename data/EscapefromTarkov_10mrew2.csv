smash-things,I love that you getting stuck on the boxes at the end was probably like a 5 head play from his perspective. He probably expected you to peek that corner much sooner.
Gafsd123,"Nice work changing positions, also got lucky with a second helmet save, good gear saves lives"
Seed_man,Love that you go straight back to corner where life is safer and chad free
laserlassie,"Good stuff,  now post loot please"
Martin_RageTV,Dude your helmet did WORK.
TheGreatWalk,"Nicely done, but here's some important advice for next time: After each kill, press F1 and your PMC will yell a bunch of insults.

This inflicts severe psychological trauma, and becomes more and more effective after each squadmate you kill."
aerosikth,And here I am unable to kill 1 person as a solo! Nice one dude
sumb0t,"Good shit my guy, as someone who only solo ques this makes me happy."
SlyXross,"I‚Äôm jealous, if i get shot with a helmet it‚Äôs either top of head or head ears"
owningstarfish,"Nice work, always changing position."
CuliacanSoldado,Wish I could experience something like this. I just one tapped walking around
Cyser93,Chad in the making
YungR29,Man i got like 200 hrs. I would love to know how many you have. Other than peaking the 2 guys you killed them all 1v1. That‚Äôs how sherpa‚Äôs told me to deal with squads but as soon as I get into this situation i forget everything. Anyways good shit man and good moves!
YutYut14,"Nice, I'm tired of dying to the there's always one more rule as a solo..."
HUNDsen76,"Great play, constantly repositioning.

And here I am playing solo for 1.2k hours and only was able to win against a duo one time. Scavs did get me afterwards though."
EducationalProduct,what ammo were you using and what armor did that first guy have?
Mercinator-87,Put that helmet on a mantle.
ElHuntar,lol is there even a reason to ads in this game?
hellrail,Omg man you are a beast
iCrazyNoodles,"I made my first 4v1 kills here too! Almost looks like my engagement apart from running back into the safe corner xD

Nice stuff OP!"
darkludus,You could see from the mouse movement the adrenaline had kicked in.
Killermen962,"0:46 5th person firing a... Sr-25 off to right? Not 100% on the gun but what happend with that guy?

Regardless holy shit you did WORK.

Edit: Scrolled down, died to duo, OOF."
master-sensai,It only took 2 rounds to the head to let you live
High__Tech,This is how I struggle with tarkov. I play like the first guy killed. I sprint when I have to and walk the most. I stop and listen here and there and if I don‚Äôt hear anything I continue. I then get killed by someone who heard me and sat still till they surprise me and then I‚Äôm dead with shit in my pants.
Kryptic-24,"Hey I mean, aim and crosshair placement could use some work, but continuing to fire while strafing and isolating your engagements really worked out for you. First dude may have flinched and threw his mouse across the room, but good stuff lol."
Conserliberaltarian,"FYI, you can reload while already sprinting this wipe! I'm so used to stopping sprint to reload, but you don't have to anymore!"
PureNaturalLagger,"Great moves by constantly changing positions, keeps the groups confused as to who is coming from where. However, the fact that you didn't prioritise right hand peeks and ESPECIALLY the slow reload on the last guy instead of dumping the mag had me thinking you're not gonna win that. Really lucky with the double helmet save as well as the enemy just not reacting in time, most likely thinking they were about to shoot a teammate. Next time do right hand peeks and make sure your weapon is always locked and loaded to qualify as the chaddest of Chads!"
Fissure_211,Nice man! I did this at the end of last wipe inside the mall. Best feeling.
Interesting-Fan-3331,Nice movement and fast changing positions. And hip fire just works
sneak_king18,Hell yeah
T4C2,"Well done dude! Rough distance for that scope. Smart use of point fire, and excellent movement to make up for it."
Richard-Long,"All I can say is good work dude, seriously"
rootxv,who was shooting the M1A?
Loringa_Malakoi,The widownmaker maker !
_Doggmatik,ggs man.
ABrowseinthePast,Good job on the movement!
ontario_cali_kaneda,You've got to love how at 0:47 the sound comes from a completely random angle.
IIFellerII,"There is a 5th guy though right?
The moment you pass around the corner where u see 2 guys lined up, you see a guy for a millisecond moving in the background behind the electric thing. Also the shots u hear to the right towards the end, come off him I think"
TheGamerSK,Holy shit the ak actually looks usable now. Thank god.
LETSSSgetWEIRDD,"I can fucking hear the first guy lmao, that's me that's me that's me, fuck I'm dead."
PASTAoPLOMO,This is exactly where I got some of my first kills. Nice plays
RedditErrorLog,Well played dude
SuikodenVIorBust,Only counts as a three man.
StartingReactors,"If I‚Äôm that squad, I‚Äôm blaming that 2nd guy. Ego pushed you instead of waiting on backup."
DabScience,"GG, those guys were free af though lol"
Seanannigans14,Shredded
Ritual_Abuser,That Rk-2 was helping serve those headeyes
JGONZ94,The unfortunate thing is how are you going to carry all that loot back you're already overweight!!
will4111,"Has the best raid of my life was a 1v4 just a couple weeks ago ended up dying to a scav because I got the bug where I couldn‚Äôt click on anything and no weapon in my hand. Which was a coincidence because all u can do is alt f4, which is what I did to close out the game and never return."
FACEIT-InfinityG,"I really do hate the fact that this game has become a pointfire fest but thats not your fault.

Your movement was good here and smart kept them guessing"
squidshark,üëçüëçüëç
Splitdifferences,The first guy never even reacted
-Shibdib-,Nice kills. You used up all your tarkov luck with none of those head shots ending you.
TryptamineSpark,Big dick clip! üëèüèª
V_Energy,"Great movement, repositioning as a solo is key. Nice one!"
ArekBarwin,I'd probably bleed out right after with my luck this wipe
TomCryptogram,Thought it was going to be a joke where you throw a grenade and kill all 5 of you
WhiteLightWarrior,Well done but still got a ton of work to do
TheoreticalPumpkin,"When there is 1, there is 2.

When there is 2, there is 3.

When there is 3, there is 4.

When there is 4, there is a scav."
PaladinKinias,"Lol, you tanked 2 headshots ""HELmeTs Are uSelEsS"". Ulach vs low pen? Or just lucky deflections?  


Nice plays and keeping your cool (mostly!). I'd have spazzed out and died getting stuck on the boxes."
Daily_RAGER,"just wanna say those 2 lucky head ricochets, that was nikita looking out for you."
side-b-equals-win,So stupid how long the first guy survived.
ZBDZD,"Smoked them hard, very well done! Your helmet also deserves a MVP award for saving you.

At the end, was you running into the boxes an intentional mind trick, or were you trying to move a bit futher?"
chubbycanine,These guys had the reaction time of a sloth lol wtf where are these nerds when I play
BigToasster,Timmy‚Äôs that found out they can use more than a PPSH. Major skill issue on their part
Subject-Culture-2620,Good shit bro that first guy almost tanked everythin
Glockify,"If that 1st kill wouldve went more smoothly, then rest wouldn‚Äôt been cake"
Jack_ten,They are so bad
REDLINE70689,"Thank god for the helmet lol. 

Good shit man. Nothing feels better than rocking a squad when your solo. Also, excellent repositionings."
ThrowTheCollegeAway,"If this was pre-patch you die 100% of the time, legit showing the movement changes in practice"
thehairycarrot,"""Helmets are worthless"" - half this sub usually"
overwatchlap,LVNDMARK junior
PckMan,"Those were 4 dudes playing solo together, very disorganised. Probably tunnel visioned to loot and didn't pay much attention to sound assuming it was just the rest of the squad. 

What you did is more or less the perfect way to deal with them. Run around, bum rush them, change positions often. They try to get you but at the same time they're not coordinated so you peek the corner and they don't know if that's you or their friend coming round the back.  Good job."
AccomplishedRip4871,"Nice one, next time heal your thorax If you can run away from your enemy"
Someguy________8,God I fucking hate seeing shit like this it pisses me off idk if you jsut got lucky or what but I‚Äôm down 617k and on a 20 losing streak I wear armor geared to the teeth I get shot in the face once I‚Äôm dead if I don‚Äôt wear armor then it‚Äôs always the thorax idk how to fuckinf play this game you‚Äôre a chad and I despise it
LQuizzy,Love it - didn't aim once.... Tarkov.
arkadiiiiii,Well played
whoopsidaiZOMBIEZ,"Nice job, it's good to see some good plays again"
poopchute53,Hipfire king
guberNailer,Wowww üò≥
pussycrusha69,How did they survive the scavs
DelugeFPS,"And then a SCAV or some dude who was ratting in a bush runs up and backtaps you as you heal.  


  
That's my experience, at least, lmfao. Every single time I pull off a 3-5 man squad wipe as a solo I'll get 3rd partied within the next 2-3 minutes, vultures be circling bro."
FRoWx,Nice movement!
Samwise_the_Tall,Man the new recoil looks so much better. Anyone know if the AI Scavs have been toned down in the past two weeks or performance improved??
MoreThem,Pls send loots
Bodark,What was that first guy doing? Lol
MrGhost94,What a ride nice job OP
Severion86,Why does your game look like minecraft?
_Cosmic_Joke_,Always a good feeling! That‚Äôll be a Tarkov memory for sure
that_one_bun,Am I just doing something wrong or how do people point shoot in this game. Anytime I try it feels as though I'm really spraying all over the place.
Code_Panther,I wasn't able to hear well the footsteps of other players in your video. Is it actually like this now? Because on previous patch I would be able to hear them like 50 to 100 meter away from me.
MRMISTRR,"Hell yeah, very well played for such a shitty spot to be stuck in to start off with"
Dixie144,Nice work
Karambamamba,What's up with that M1A shooting at 0:45?
WhichSeaworthiness49,Nice moves
Ballzonyah,Have I been messing up by aiming this whole time?
buttsu556,"your heart mustve been beating out of your chest lol. i dont get as much of an adrenaline rush as i used to, been playing for a while but sure do remember some of the fights i had that had my whole body shaking back when i was somewhat new to the game. tarkov pvp is too good."
BRM-Pilot,Bro that first guy took so much ammo what the hell
FrugalPeasant,This is why this game is so addictive when solo you get flogged so many times but when you pull this off you are on top of the world. I killed a three man with a saiga 9 near Skeletor on customs night raid and it made up for the constant deaths.
BotanyAttack,"Hey I found the same armour, guess I should save it for an important raid"
mcresto,Was this after all the changes the past few days? Doesn't seem like that would have been possible before
NitroDickclapp,Is this with the new changes? I noticed you didn't lose all your stamina when he hit you with with what I assume is 7.62 coming out of a silenced RFB?
STARFAXMACHINETTV,The true mvp in this clip is your helmet saving you twice. Good shooting bro solid 4K
IronsevsTwitch,Well done
baigelsx,Helmet MVP
Deathnachos,"Duuude, I was getting nervous for you that was great."
BitterQuitter11,Great hip/point shootin man
MrCoolGuy1924,I'd be making sweet love to that helmet after that.
Enthused_Llama,"Everyone: It's so unrealistic that movie bad guys come at the good guy one at a time

Tarkov Players:




---------------------------------

Honestly though super clean and the guys weren't total lemmings because they did tag you in the head a couple of times. Good demonstration of how gear can change the engagement."
Ant10102,Where‚Äôs the loot pic!
_Pretzel,Alwayswl wear helmets
fatmexican09,"Bro, I bet you felt so juiced the fuck up I legitimately felt your excitement"
BlueCray1,I just know your ballsack was sweating bullets bro
MOR187,I have to stop ads ing.
Ruinf20,That Helmet working overtime good shit.
EducatorPhysical,How do you fight 4 ppl without painkiller and get to live to tell the story? I always get a broken leg and then firing squad haha
RobOnTheReddit,"Wow, well done"
Grizzly4nicator,"Losers running a 4 man on Interchange. You did us solos proud there, brotha."
Kvietl,God that first guy absolutely ate your PS
No-Carry-7886,"How come I never get to play against these types of players, I fucking wish they would just walk in the open like a dumbass blind bat."
SeriousLee91,Is this game just a spray and pray hip fire simulator? I quit cod because i hates that dumb jump around the corner and spray your hipfire but every video here is just mod you weapons and hipfire spray?
Jaxxon88,Theyre literally behaving like npcs
Mangustii,Rat
vutikable,There‚Äôs no way you tanked all those bullets
0verStrike,"Dude, first guy did a reversed entry. He deserves that.  Who tf enters a room with their backs towards the entrance?? Id you cleared outiside the next possible danger is inside the room lmao"
whoevenkn0wz,"I was stressed for you, good work haha"
just-some-man,Wow! Hit in the head twice and survived!
ghoths,Where are all those tiny pp boys with 'helmets don't do anything now'
Lord_Elon,"I watched this and thought, so aiming with a sight is pointless, and as I hipfire, my rounds paint the Mona Lisa around them and they get a lucky head eyes. I love Tarkov, good shit dude."
RITCHDAKING,Gz on the tims with bad ammo. They hit you so many times lol
its_Hepho,I could feel your heart beating bro. Good fight!
DutySuccessful148,"Thank god for the changes. Before the recent weight, stamina and recoil changes I think you probably would have lost this fight. Not because of skill or anything, just with bullets draining stamina so much and everything you would have been drained and not been as mobile as you were with evading. Very nice."
Shade477,Can hear your heartbeats from here
AverageDad_86,It didn't disappoint my dude fair play no ads either they must have been soooo mad! You defo got reported and they all disconnected afterwards ü§£
Traditional_Tax8672,First guy definitely had a heart attack ik he jumped
Flynesss,"To my first wipers, double tap R to reload faster but drop the mag."
Tall-Slip-1412,Heck yes
relder58,Tarkov giveth
d00b661,Damn you must of been sweating lol
seventener,Better than seggs?
Illtakeboffum,"They couldn‚Äôt tell for sure if they were hearing you, multiple people or eachother lol"
TheSmokeJumper_,"Getting shot in the head and keep on going, you are a tank hahaha"
NapalmGeiger,The way you had the last guy checking the wrong corner was beautiful.
misterxandy,Please tell me you made it out alive.
Darth_Lord_,That was clean. I have been watching this game for awhile now dont have a pc yet. It seems like they allow a bit more of a fast past style over the years huh ? Like being able to move and shot a bit more accurate. You might just be good haha
Lazy_v2,Ulach for the win baby!
No-Phase2131,They removed recoil completly.. Fuck this game
togxic,"Does everyone play that game like a rodent? Serious question, never played it and that makes me never want to! Lol"
Vinddictive_,You play like a bot holy shit
HarveeyyyyyDentt,"Thorax/head shots the entire fight, good job shitting on cheaters üëè"
Rossismark,This game is call of duty now
MarcusAurelius0,Point fire nerf when?
pursuitofhappy,Do you use an overlay sight on your monitor?
