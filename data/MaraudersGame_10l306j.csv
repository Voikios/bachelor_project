Langss11,"After getting domed by Terminator every time last night, these new nerfs are welcomed!"
CasualRascal,The term nerf we all knew was coming. That thing was way too strong for how cheap and easy it was to craft and use.
SchufAloof,"""Fixed bug where melee weapons could do bullet impact sounds when they hit surfaces.""

Awww, that's what made the machete scary."
ThatOneGuy6381,Last night was the first night I ever tried some Terminator runs… and its already dead. Wild.
CoffeeParachute,Fuck yes.
algabraicat,"Not gonna lie, I’m gonna miss the knife making gun shot noises."
thelostandfound618,10/10 update. Keep it going guys!
MyNameIsSimon88,Are items in inventory now showing much darker for anyone else?
Bulletproof_Babies,"Love to see it! Thanks for all the hard work, we love you guys! <3"
terrencethetomato,"Mostly good fix. 

In very salty at the change in the trench gun though - the effective range has been reduced, and the range at which you can hit all pellets makes it a lot less scary, almost unusable against auto-rifles."
Maybedeadbynow,THANK YOU!
ConceivedEmu,Thank you guys! You guys are doing great. I’ve been addicted to this game since Christmas and you just made my day. Keep up the good work!
HODOR00,"Terminator terminated.  Thanks for the work devs, nothing like seeing the complaints get addressed!"

FakMiPls,Thank you!
MaxIrons,"Thank you. I know work on this stuff is hard, and prioritizing in such a small team is doubly so.  These are all appreciated."
TheSpecter9029,"Traders seem to be a bit bugged now, Wolff and Calico's inventories are greyed out except for lv 1 items, but the levels themselves haven't been reset. Anyone else have this problem?"
de_profiteer,good news however game is crashing right after start
UnsettllingDwarf,So many more games need updates like this. I don’t need new content I need the content that’s there to work well. Thanks for the optimization and fixes.
-BlockadeRunner-,The shotgun AI fix is HUGE
