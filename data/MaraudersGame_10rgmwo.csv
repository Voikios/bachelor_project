( Literally just went into a match last night and crazyirish and one of his teammates got me while I was armed with an MP40 that had attachments, Plate Rig full of food, some 10mm ammo boxes and a Mauser broom handle. Sucked. Thankfully I hadn't looted anything yet and had basically just shot a raider down, been shot in the leg by them, then those two come charging in and I slightly wound both before getting dropped because their latency was through the roof. xD )"
HairyYesterday0,Aim higher bro and wiggle when you fight
SenorPancake,"Maraudon't.

Honestly I've found more success running and gunning recently than sticking around corners. If you know where someone is, can be very much worth it to force the engagement on your timing than to give them that benefit and rely on your reaction time. At least in close quarters, it makes a huge difference."
gummybearsforlife,ooof it be like that
bzadaniel,Bro. This is me :(
Snipershot111,That's funny yesterday I had a terrible day to every single time I fought a marauder it was a duo team almost all except for 2 exceptions. There so close that even if I kill one there always another that does a follow up that I can't defend against or at the last moment I see the 2nd one before the both blast me Into oblivion I think I'm gonna go back to my scavenger ways. :(
MrMustardSNA,"Bro, your clips crack me up every time lol

Try being more aggressive in gunfights. Slow peaking around corners (especially left hand peaks) against enemies that know you're there will always get you killed. Set your engagements so you are right hand peaking from good cover. If you have to fall back into a more advantageous position, make sure you don't put yourself in a corner. Always leave room to reposition. Cover and concealment are important in this game as well. A lot of stuff is wall bangable so know what you're standing behind. 

Good luck out there, marauder"
BigMexican69,you gotta lower your sensitivity man
Pleasant_Issue,"Practise your leans man, come on!!! Gotta have just your head and gun pop around the corner. Bind them to something easy and have them toggle"
chaosdemonhu,You should look up peekerâ€™s advantage.
brinaldi15,aim for head
So_bored_of_you,If you're running solo don't wear red dude
Apart-Ad5085,Gotta go slow and steady and let them push youâ€¦. Sorry about that terminator to the chest thatâ€™s one my favorite moves.
HallowzoneOG,Ouch yeah I felt this. My Marauder KD is 1.6 so itâ€™s safe to say Iâ€™ve been doing pretty well.
high_idyet,Maybe you could aim a little bit higher?
Exciting-Tadpole8743,Aim for the head and not the legs
SoberOccassionally,Get good kid
