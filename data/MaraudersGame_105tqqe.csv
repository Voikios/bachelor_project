FakeSafeWord,Commentator is high as fuck.
marsanch10,"So I heard shots and as I was creeping up I saw an AI fighting with another player. Instead of shooting the AI I decided to use him as a scout and bait. I was very surprised when the AI stayed locked on the other player instead of shooting me, even though I was the closer easier target. After the other player killed the AI I waited for my opportunity and killed the other player like a true rat. 

Very rare occurrence, probably wont happen again.

Also please excuse my friend talking/backseat gaming, he was watching me stream and when I clipped it, I realized too late that my settings are set so I'm muted but you can hear my friends, rookie mistake lol"
