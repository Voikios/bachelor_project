wordsarelouder,"the part that kills me is that they saw through bushes, then they fixed it and then the fix gets rolled back. How bad is their code base that they have all these constant rollbacks of fixes they've already done?"
jep2k3,"They have their moments... I just killed 5 scavs in a row, the first one I rushed him through bushes, and the 4 others, one by one, randomly (?) walked toward me while I was looting, in the middle of bushes, it was scary as hell because I thought they would beam me from outside the bushes while I wouldn't see them, I had trouble confirming each kill, but turns out BSG nerfed (generally) their ability to head, eyes us through wall and vegetation."
I-wanna-fuck-SCP1471,"I dont understand how its so hard to stop AI from seeing through bushes, why cant trees just block visibilty traces like any other opaque object?"
KeKinHell,"The AI in this game, how awful it is, just baffles me. There are games decades old that have AI more competent than tarkov's. At the very least, they can tell when the player is behind something that they *shouldn't be able to fucking see through*.

Now, granted, I don't think that jumping into/behind a bush should be a ""get out of shit free"" card. I think that if you duck behind or into a bush, the scav should just start unloading randomly into the bush; but it definitely should be accurate like that."
jepu22,Agree but holy bass boost your audio is fucked
lordwerneo92,"Yeah, and rouges having 300 meters nightvision without actual nighvision."
Gabaloo,"I remember when I first started playing, scavs would just pile into the forklift room, sometimes back first.  It was stupid easy and we used to farm xp that way.

There has to be some middle ground between deaf dumb blind scavs, and scavs with xray vision"
-RetroSight-,Yikes this game looks busted.
Saltanistic,A glorious fall at the end
qleptt,I like how scavs also will run and just crouch in bushes immediately its such a cool feature that i like
TheFunkadelicOne,"Once they see you they stay locked on regardless of if they have line of sight or not. I had one shooting a wall next to me from the other side. Had another one shoot me from 3 story when I was in 2 story then keep shooting through windows in rooms with closed doors while I was in the hall. Had sniper scav shooting at me from skeleton to 2 story, then all the way to usec. On lighthouse I took 1 out then ran back to mountain and cut through half the map to reposition with cover only to get dommed the moment I scoped up. I've also noticed that almost every time I aim down sights on a scav they immediately turn and aim at me before I shoot regardless of distance. The AI is terrible this wipe so far."

bongscoper,"At least that one yelled before it started shooting. I was coming up to skeleton hole in the wall from dorms and got shot from the bushes by the hole. Scav didn't even yell. I thought it was a pmc at first but no, it was a mute ai scav"
SUNTZU_JoJo,"You again with the MCX and massive scope. I thought I recognised that build.

Why so much love for the MCX with big scopes? Is it the high ergo of the weapon? What ammo you running with that?"
BoAR3D,7 years beta game becoming more trash and stupid year after year
NoInformation1632,Bud your first mistake was being out of some type of cover. Second mistake you jumped into the pile of rubble instead of going through the broken wall and right hand peeking. Third mistake was thinking when BSG says they fixed something.

loongod5,Skill issue
SeansBeard,"Zavodskoy brothers came through that wall, sat in bush and killed me few minutes into raid. Havent played since. Fuck this wipe."
Academic-Fisherman42,yeah the AI is bs but like... what was your plan there? run to an elevated surface to ensure the head tap from the scav? you had all day to run thru that wall
Ovnii3,skil isu ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
Dat_Innocent_Guy,Why does your game sound like ass?
Stunning-Cap7396,Yeah cause the smart idea is to spray randomly back into the bushes instead of running
killlugh,"With how often these clips get posted, i cant believe this game still has a playerbase. I only watch for entertainment lol"
AlphaLawless,"Scav was doing recon by fire. You fired back so he knew you were there and tried to suppress you. He got lucky and hit you in the head.

Now if you were behind cover and not concealment you would've lived.

TLDR; Git gud"
Average_PMK1_enjoyer,Being rude isnt gonna make'em fix it faster
Anxious_Matter5020,"You could have ran through the hole in the wall and avoided that, but your experience told you otherwise.
Edit: that scav also likely saw you before those bushes but you ignored it and kept running then cut the clip to give yourself reasonable doubt."
NotTactical,"I had an sks scav on my last woods raid shoot me 3 consecutive times in the back through a bunch of bushes, luckily they can spawn with only HP now and I was was wearing class 3, unfortunately it was the DRD armor, which is still a soft armor despite being class 3 so he nearly killed me purely through blunt damage while only taking like 4 durability off of my armor lmao."
Matto_boi,Sthturman guard saw me and headshotted me parelly through pile of logs 5 meters long
TurtleBilliam,Lol
pincedu17,Also regular scavs using static turrets are way too accurate for drunk russians scavenging
ShaddyDaShadow,"But they nerfed the scavs accuracy guys, all is well now :)"
DoubleSoupVerified,Notorious death trap if scavs are alive in that area and you decided to jump on top of some rubble
Some_GuyorDude,Had the Same Shit Happen to me on Woods in the Village near scav Bridge/scav bunker
Trick_College2491,Oh hey I think I got your gun as a scav later!
StealthCatUK,Is this the shoreline paca MCX guy? ðŸ˜‚
No-Research4178,Fix the scavs full auto with pinpoint acuracy!!!
dodgyeduck,"This looks like knight or big pipe firing m62 .300, i had the exact same screen when I got mowed down on woods by them, all those tracers through a bush looks like the goon squad. Too bad didnt show the death screen."
CandyCaine0002,This is one of the things that really pisses me off. Happened to me a few times now with some good gear on
Limp-Collar-5842,I'm mean yea that's agitating but you died bc you jumped on something for no reason
grateking,Quick spray back at the enemy I canâ€™t see instead of sprinting to cover - me as well probably
Lishak429,Git gut
McRazyy13,I'm just waiting for Dark and Darker at this point.
sakic1519,What is that scope
reesonz,"this is one of my top 3 pevs... after audio being sh!t, and general network performance."
freshlyborn34,How about get gud
platinummattagain,"In all fairness, shots 1 - 5 did clearly miss"
AppropriateDuck6404,factory is stupid run a scav watch the scavs they hug walls and look through them turning around into the wall trying to walk through it
ClaytorYurnero,"Scav sight is just all over the place, earlier I killed a couple right at that spot then went prone in the bushes near white car to heal.  

An AI scav literally walked over me without realizing a thing until I got up and ADS'd at him."
The1stHorsemanX,It makes me so sad that engaging Scavs is so often a death sentence since concealment just doesn't exist and they have such pinpoint accuracy.
MrPsyy,Got one shooting me head/eye from Ruaf when I was in the bus on the bridge of Customs. Right.
rauke_,"He wouldve seen you before you went behind foliage, players will do the same."
rangermcclure,I just had 3 scavs walk up to me in woods but they didn't see me cause I was in a bush. Looks like bad luck
CommanderKertz,"They can also apparently mount the machine guns now, see, and smoke you through the second story of crack house in one burst"
Onlyeddifies,I was laying in a bush in the dark going through my inventory and two scavs flanked me from either side and they turned their flashlights on me and one shot me. I was making no noise and it was pitch black in a bush. Make it make sense
Gourds2theMoon,I so rarely kill a PMC cause I am shit. I finally got one on Shoreline and hauled ass to extract. I get there and get head eyes out of nowhere by a scav sitting in a bush. Its just not fun this way.
Key_Poetry4023,Sit
forestfrog79,"It's not a bug, it is a feature :D"
Obscured_Love,"The scavs also one shot me I have died more times to a scav then a player, They have pretty much aimbot, That i can't fight off."
Underlowhero,This
LQuizzy,Lucky bullet stray's happen in war my friend. He missed a handful before he got you. Nothing wrong here.
TurtleBilliam,This is good. The scab saw you and continues to spray into where he thought you might be. Going behind a bush doesnâ€™t immediately mean someone wouldnâ€™t shoot where they though you were. Outplayed
R0Y-BATTY,"This wipe seems so much fun, wish I was still playing."
Ovnii3,"What I find incredible, is that honestly, unironically fortnite has some better realism feats than tarkov"
hoo_rah,Tbf if I saw a player run into the bushes I would be doing exactly the same thing the scav was doing. Unfortunately only hard cover breaks LOS for Scavs. I had to learn that the hard way too :(
WhichSeaworthiness49,Pro tip: shoot at the direction the tracers come from
Caine_Pain333,Why not run to cover?
