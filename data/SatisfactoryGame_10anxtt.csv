Chnebel,"the right answer is you build 3 more, remember that you miscalculated and need even more, have no space left, then go i dont wana put another floor and just overclock itüòÇ"
skunk_jumper,Why not both. The planet won't pollute itself
mainest_,"You should only really overclock machines. You can build more but not more resource nodes. However if you have the power and the shards, go for it!"
Dutchtdk,Overclock natural resource extractions. Add buildings for the rest. Neither space nor produced items/minute are a concern. Natural resources are finite
houghi,"I build more, unless I need it in a very small space.

And yes, you can farm slugs form doggos, but otherwise they are limited. So I only overclock miners and the like. The map is big enough, so space is not really an issue, unless you decide for yourself that it is."
Commissarfluffybutt,"I only overclock machines on resource nodes as those are actually limited. Then, those resources go into the spaghetti network and are never seen again."
Vloddamick,Build 10 then underclock each to .10 and reap the power savings and easy upscaling later.
KYO297,"Unless it's a miner or an oil extractor, I never overclock. Or a semi-manual temporary factory. Then it's 250% on *everything*"
atcwillf,Not hard at all.   Does it output RAW materials?  Overclock it.  Does it put out refined / constructed materials?  Build another one.
Helluscus,"Underclock 50%, build 6 more, use about 25% less power :)"
ThunderGodOrlandu,I reserve overclocking specifically for pulling resources out of the ground ( the beginning of the line) and for the final machine(s) producing the end product ( the end of the line).
Robert999220,"I oc the miners and use EVERY other building normally.

The factory is getting large."
Flats490,"Overclock the miner, build 6 more"
robertsong87,Smash both buttons
Gonemad79,"I hate when you start building and you run out belts capacity. I mean, you reach 1500 items/min or something and there's no room to put more belts splitting the load to 2 belts, and you wonder why it takes so long for an item to reach the machine you just built.

Or you realize you made some x10 error and you built 10x what you needed, leave it there anyway and you later you keep running out of that thing you built 10x over.

Then you just give up and go find more ore spots and start over."
BigLuck2001,Obviously build 3.... Overclock 3 and it's inputsüòâ
Gunk_Olgidar,"I use shards to improve raw resource extraction on miners/extractors beyond what default miners and extractors can do -- this is the only way to solve the limited raw resource problem.   

Every other problem in the game can be solved another way (building more machines).   

Can't build more iron nodes."
Salty_NUggeTZ,The right answer is ‚ÄúBuild 3 of it‚Äù. Overclock only the resource extraction machines. That‚Äôs only real limit. All other buildings can be increased in number. Unless of course you‚Äôre going for minimal footprint and less machines and blah blah blah spawn shards blah blah.
Exion_V,Answer yes.
Quackulaa,What you do is...you build 3 and then overclock them all....then get annoyed at your terrible efficiency and build more...then realise they are too efficient and then need to build more....and you ran out of space....so you restart it....and build vertical.....then you abandon that project and start a new one. And heeeeere we go again
czarchastic,Overclocking got buffed. Go with the left option.
MANN_OF_POOTIS,Moree
Bauch_the_bard,Overclock miners build 3 of every production building
Zockemon,"I always build 3 more, except when its a resource extractor(Water/Oil Pumps, Miners, etc.)"
FreshPitch6026,"Building 3 is more production capability than overclocking to 250%. So the answer is obvious, no hard choice"
Louiscypher93,Really depends on my mood. I usually end up building 4 and then under clocking...
DogWoofWoof22,"Best practice is to always overclock miners, because you only have so many nodes, and maybe also final product machine if you have powershards left over, but even that its better to just build more machines."
Inviz1mal,People commited to extinct the planet so the factor grows: Build 3 and over clock those
SgtDoughnut,"Its not that hard, what do you want to save, power or space?  


If power you build 3, if space you over clock."
Bladekai,Nevr overclock unless it is miner
shadow9876543210,i build 3 overvclock them all than later question why i have 12 boxes of screws
Anastariana,Still waiting for Mark 4 miners with 2 belt outputs.
Mizar97,Build 3 more because all my power shards are already being used üò†
darkaxel1989,"Miners and Oil: overclock. You can't build more nodes.

Power Plants: build them and make them work at 100%

Anything else: Build 30 of it and spare electricity by underclocking to 10%"
AeternusDoleo,"\*smashes both buttons repeatedly\*

The factory must grow!"
ExccelsiorGaming,"Both, both is good."
loli141,"Easy solution, build 1 and afk for 3 times more"
chaoschosen665,"Since this last patch, I've only been overclocking my fuel generators to save on materials and space while getting the same output."
Geese-chaser,Depends on space vs power.
HazmatikNC,"Build 3, then when you want to process more resources later you overclock all 3 and don't have to build more, just upgrade the belts."
nlamber5,"I always build multiple. If I‚Äôm not wrong, it‚Äôs more energy efficient"
SirCharlesLucasII,"Depends on the complexity of the machine... Blender? Manufacturer? Overclock, everything else? Build more"
Byizo,Always build more if you have the space. Less energy cost. At a certain point there is no more uranium to mine... Always overclock miners/fluid extractors.
pisulo,"Underclock it, build 6 of it and half the coal generators"
HeavyMetalPootis,"Eh, just run the pumps faster; not like we've got NPSH issues to deal with in-game. lol"
playr_4,Build 3 of them and overclock all of them.
Old_Fart_on_pogie,"If it‚Äôs a resource node, over clock. If it‚Äôs manufacturing build three"
LeagueofBurn,underclock it :D
W34kness,Or both!
gdsorzen,"Fully overclocked=250% efficiency

3 buildings=300% efficiency"
Icaros_Crowe,Nah build 250 and underclock them all to 1%.
FED_YT,Why not build 2 and overclock both?
Equivalent_Cicada153,Build three then you can over lock them later when you upgrade
FrostyFroZenFrosTen,"I only overclock the miners, cuz you will actualy run out of hot energy slugs in your area"
Skullz64,Me: exploration is my passion
Chibi_Evil,"A third choice!! 

Overclock/underclock specific machines in the production to make the merged belts carry exact amounts of items to the next process. No need for smart splitters!!"
Colonel_dinggus,Both
ICANTTHINK0FNAMES,I always pick the red button.
DyCeLL,"Welcome to programming üôè 
Now suffer forever.."
xloHolx,"I only overclock when I need like, .1 to .4 more assemblers/constructeurs/things

‚Ä¶


Despite having given myself 10000 purple slugs or something equally insane lmao"
LaurelRaven,"Build 3, the mats are unlimited and the space is close enough to unlimited for our purposes, but slugs aren't (or at least gathering more than what's on the map is not nearly as easy)

Also, there's only so much power on the map, and even if you're not close to hitting that limit, you'll be needing to tap more of it to overclock a large portion of your production

Extraction side, though, overclock the hell out of that"
eee170,I usually find the best solution and then do the wurst
Super_Cheburek,Both. Both is good.
Razorray21,overclock it now. build 5 when i scale up later.
rideh,"always overlcock, optimize for pc/server performance because thats a wall thats hard to work around."
R0ckandr0ll_318,Depends on the product
Nightspark115,Damn they both be expensive
zetaxxprod,build 3 and overclock them all
DarksArts,Simply do both
roundandbearded,Why not both?
TheSpaceRonin,Why not both
catsflatsandhats,There is a point of realization in every ficsit employee where you understand that if you run into situations where you need to overclock nonminers it just means that your factory building approach is flawed.
