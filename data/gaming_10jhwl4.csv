newbrevity,FACT: 30fps gives you twice as much time to enjoy each frame than 60fps.
eddyak,OP has solved the argument once and for all.
MyRedditUsername1101,"Remember when ubisoft said their games were in 30fps because it's more ""cinematic""?"
Kiethblacklion,30fps? 60fps? Who cares? You still can't hijack or derail the train without mods.
NA_Panda,"1 FPF

1 Frame Per Forever"
InconspicuousDemon7,I dunno 60fps looks a lot better in these images
ISAV_WaffleMasta,Someone get me my tinfoil hat
,[removed]
No-Pomegranate-69,This is actually 0fps
Nasssi,Bottom one should have 2 pictures.
farfetchedfrank,Lol
wolfgang784,That's why I play capped at 14fps. Less electricity use and it looks the same anyway - save the polar bears! /s
Joverby,Remember when console lords would actually argue in favor of 30 fps ?
Affectionate-Grand99,I’m so glad a still image was offered so I could accurately discern the difference between these frame rates
LepidusII,May I present the holy grail: 40 fps
taunids,My head literally just tried explode due to knowing that some people would honestly believe that a still photo comparison can show the difference of fluidity in game play. I weep for those that do not understand.
420420696942069,my human eye can only see the 30 fps picture
Trejin1,The top image hurts my eyes
Capable_Edge_1236,Propaganda is the best map in Battlefield
Vaxildan156,"I have never had an issue with 30 fps and used to be the guy who was against ""60fps snobs"". Until I got this new graphics card and replayed Elden Ring and Monster Hunter in 60fps vs the 30fps I was used to. Ive become one of those snobs now"
phoquenut,checkmate.  Now do 1 fps.
Azamet_Turan_1922,LMAO
Ok_Green_9873,redditors think they are so intelligent for knowing how fps works lol
LaughOdd6345,The same people who bought GTA5 remastered because the characters have better fingernails
OhMyGodItsWiel,"My phone has a refresh rate of 90hz, so am I not looking at it at 90 fps?"
SteveZissousGlock,This image brought to you by 480p
Jlt230,By the gods you are right! This makes so much sense.
Strasdg,the argument once and for all.
A4K0SAN,still rocking gta v on 50 fps 1080p kinda highish settings on my i3 7100 and gtx 1050
HenReX_2000,Is there a version of this picture but it's 60fps normal gameplay vs physics engine freaking out at high fps?
CoWood0331,I blink 100 times per second so I’m getting 160 FPS. Get on my level nerd.
Rivieru-Moreh,"OK , sure your playing speed will be the same..."
5_meng___o,"There's no difference if you don't compare them, if you get what i mean"
defiant_1974,scanline sync...30 fps...smooth frames...no tear line...max settings...bliss
ghettogangbang69,Propone and propone accessories
fishbulbx,I can see the top of the mountains in 60 fps.
kozinc,"With this image, 1FPS is equal to 120FPS."
zchatham,I didn't think I cared about 60fps until I realized I had unknowingly set Horizon Forbidden West to performance mode. I changed it over to resolution mode to better enjoy the scenery.  It felt like the game was stuttering constantly.  I had to switch back.  There was no chance I could keep playing that game on resolution mode after getting used to it running at 60.
MeIncogNeto,"Nah, even the screenshot looks better at 60fps."
Srirachestershire,No you can definitely see that the bottom image is about twice as still as the top image.
Blazanar,"Who would've thought that 30 FPS and 60 FPS would look the same at 0 FPS, amirite?"
Kyle_Krafter,"I would say that FPS and graphic quality are not the same thing though.

The images can look the same. Only when the game is running, is when FPS comes into play.

Single images cannot display FPS. They can display graphic quality.

Once you get to 60 fps or higher. There is a certain smoothness you do experience. When you drop below that. 

You can tell. Like when you have latency, encounter a bug, or have world generation occurring.

You can play most games these days with custom settings, it doesn't always mean the game will run or play better."
30RefillPackets,"Oh man... I know people who would actually briefly believe this validates their ""30 fps is fine"" mentality.

I don't willingly know them, I assure you."
throwaway292888,"We're still stuck on the 30 vs 60 war.

Where's the 1GHz monitors, eh? Heh"
Longjdg, I weep for those that do not understand.
1mStillStanding,Lol
limitless350,60fps is twice as demanding on the pc for no difference. It’s all been a scam!  I’m going back to integrated graphics.  :p
ThighBiter1993,"To be completely honest, because I'm not tech savvy at all, I cannot for the life of me spot a difference in fps at all"
geargun2000,I personally am fine with 30 FPS. Is it ideal? No. But it’s not bad at all and the game is still just as good
Nesayas1234,"For those of you who don't get it, fps only applies to moving stuff. These are both still images and thus aren't affected. If this was supposed to be real, Op would have used a video or gif instead"
SpooN04,"Ok but surely an image of the same thing at 144fps would look better...right? RIGHT?!? 

/s"
Sabbathius,"What kind of f\*\*\*ed up PC Master Racer still talks about 60 FPS? These days I'm playing VR in 120 fps, minimum. And on flat screen it's 144 fps on ultra-wide screen. Today, 60 fps is what 30 fps used to be."
hashimishii,"True, 60fps and 30fps are basically the same thing. Now 240fps on the other hand....."
Jalaleen,"Doesn't FPS mean Frames Per Seconds?

&#x200B;

Oh clearly its a sarcastic post and I misunderstood."
sandstorml,One says 30fps and one says 60fps. I think it’s pretty clear the bigger number the better
schnaab,Lol
upicked11,Lol
Milnoc,It's like Beta vs VHS!
Spartan_Cat_126,I like trains
tyrant_of_discord,"Nice try, Gamefreak."
huyria,Plan C boys
Slurm818,Don’t both PS5 and Xbox Series X run 4K @ 60fps?  Mine seems to on my C2
AshesX,Real gamers want 144fps 144hz
HappyGamer29196,"Corporate wants you to find the difference between this picture and this picture. 
They're the same picture!"
ThePreacher19021,How the F
ThyBuffTaco,69fps is the way
Adorable-Bullfrog-30,Succ cum
soiramio3000,"it depends on the game.

in games with high action(like shooters and fighting games) the framerate matters a lot.

in games with very little action(like pokemon and puzzle games) the frame rate does not matter thaaat much."
nexnox,even 60fps is too slow
j1mmie,but did you try 240fps
Toy_Cop,Propoganda
draemn,Why does it smell like an onion in here?
ManbosMambo,"Some games literally run fine at 1 FPS, it is entirely dependent on the game."
CorellianDawn,Um actually that bottom one is at 59.94 fps
Rpilla001,11FPS idls better. Because 11 is one better than 10
NipplzDaClown,You can propaganda at these nuts.
dexterip,"Second image is faster, cant u see? :)"
iansynd,"Well, they aren't wrong."
Ffdmatt,Shit it's 1 frame per infinity and it still looks good!
OsrsGoku,lmfao 30fps games can't even load the sun? what a world
got_little_clue,technically that’s 0 FPS for these still pictures
DaManWhoCannotBeMove,I'm more of a 24fps guy myself
JesseSavage1,How does a static image prove anything about a frame rate? Is this supposed to be funny?
Lieutenant_0bvious,I have a 240hz monitor to compensate for my penis size.
Fat_Nerd3566,"actually thats because its a solid image and there is no way that you could see the frame rate difference unless the picture is actually moving, no need to thank me i just do what i do to show people the REAL truth 😎😎😎🤓🤓🤓, don't let these feds trick you into thinking things that aren't true, TAKE THE RED PILL, JACK YOURSELD OUT OF THE MATRIX"
Garpocalypse,"There's definitely a difference with the music.  The problem with most of these remasters and re-releases is that they leave the music and sfx running at 30 fps which makes a noticeable difference.  






/s duh. 

I did hear someone say this once years ago and I haven't been able to get it out of my head...."
ejerkel,Great video about the history of frame rate https://youtu.be/mjYjFEp9Yx0
sea_of_gems,"60fps image unlocks the sun, 30 just crops it out. Matter marked as settled."
geraltoftibia,"The moment 4090 costs the same as a console this will be a valid argument until then PC won't be able to beat the accessibility, ease and value of a console. Still tho i don't use my ps5 that much compared to PC."
UncleWillard5566,The mountains are cut off in the 30fps pic. Checkmate!
LochNessMansterLives,I got caught for 1.2 seconds before I realized just how right you are OP.
larsvondank,Post of the year. Its finally over.
soapbutt,Imagine not playing at 144 FPS
d3ds3c_0ff1c147,"Take enough edibles, and life itself will slow to 10fps"
RichardCheeseLicker,"Coming from poverty, loooong behind us all now. I’m just happy I get to play games, 30 or 60fps, 1080 or 4k, I really don’t care.

I get to experience the latest and don’t have to sit on the sidelines only wishing I could back when I was a kid."
BoobieDobey01,"To be perfectly honest, I never noticed much of a difference between 30fps and 60fps

The image might be A LITTLE smoother and clearer, but the human eye can only perceive so much before it doesn't really matter, anymore.

It's the reason why 4k 120fps doesn't make sense to me."
CorpulentMagistrate,Who from PCMR would even let you think that 60fps is acceptable?
NarutoFan1995,60 is mid on pc... lets talk 120
WORLDBENDER,"This is a meme, right? 

…… right?"
Mrgood16,This is a still picture
Nuck3lz,You see the difference after looking for at least one whole second.
CMC_Conman,this is the funniest meme i've seen in awhile
Tuggerfub,"depends entirely on the game type.

i would not fps pvp at 30"
BoredVet85,wait you get multiple frames?
About7fish,"You laugh, but I weep. My hopes of restoring a minimum of 60fps and pushing for higher refresh rates have been dashed by ray tracing and meme resolutions."
VTWAX_ONLY_INVESTOR,60? We're at 144/240 my dude. 60FPS should be the standard for consoles even.
Top_Seller_69,POV: U are 20's kid and you understand what is to be happy playing with 30fps.
kd5nrh,"Heck, I've seen monitors with comparison photos in newspaper ads. 

Seriously. B&W halftone printed pictures side by side trying to show how much better their resolution and color rendering was. 

How the hell that made it through proofing I'll never understand."
s_rock78,"I thought this was an ""ate the onion"" post... argue frames per second with a still image. Gotta love the internet."
HanginLowNd2daLeft,Both images taken by the Kodak Potato
ronintetsuro,I know I'm a pedant but; having two different images here makes my shriveled little meme heart sing.
Kyuojin,The sad part is people still actually think 60 isn't better than 30 in literally every way.
Comp625,"At the end of the day, ""to each their own."" I'm going to assume this is a joke meme, and that OP isn't serious.

Gamers can and still do have fun with lower framerate games (I remember PS1 games being very choppy compared to my PC at the time). Not everyone is as sensitive to differences in framerate either; I definitely can but have friends who cannot unless performance is incredibly terrible.

Nevertheless, it's inevitable that pro-30fps gamers will eventually come around and appreciate higher framerates. There were waves of this when Playstation first rolled out Performance Mode and it wow'ed unenlightened gamers."
xkirbz,I remember arguing with gamefaqs users years ago on how 30fps is unplayable. I honestly believe this was their thought process.
Another_Road,Prepare to see this joke plastered a million times on every gaming related subreddit you can find.
perroarturo,"All we had to do was follow the damn train, CJ!"
Janificus,60fps???? Simply unplayable. The game has to be at least 120fps!
Diablix,"If you take 1000 photos of an arrow in flight, then in every frame the arrow is unmoving. Since the arrow is unmoving in all frames, it is naturally reasonable to conclude that the arrow in flight is unmoving."
Illustrious-Slice-91,Someone tell me if I’m wrong… how can you tell the difference between a 30 fps and 60 fps picture on a STILL PICTURE
chuckdooley,"For the lazy, I actually unconverted the top image to 60 fps and downconverted the bottom pic to 30 fps

Then I turned it upside down and regressed the image into a jpeg “chiller” to coincide the two photos at the same FPS.

Turns out, the results were inconclusive and my PC is covered in orange soda"
Madsy9,"Joke aside, 60 fps as the ""standard"" is also an artificial limit gamers have accepted from the industry. I ran Quake 3 Arena and Counter-Strike at 160 fps on a 160hz monitor 22 years ago. Also: people should care just as much about physics updates per second as fps."
Laughingbuddha77,"I know this is satire but 30fps makes me physically sick now. I don’t understand why, I have been gaming for years and it was never a problem before. It seems that since I have been able to play at 60fps I can’t go back."
kain52002,1fpe.  Frame per ever.
