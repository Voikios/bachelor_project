It\u2019s kill or be kill and both parties are trying hard to kill. I don\u2019t want to feel bad for \u201cmurdering\u201d someone trying to plead for mercy. \n\nThis game\u2019s PvP is too much fun and I think a lot of that is the \u201creviled\u201d sweaty play style aka people just trying to shoot other people. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t some death match game, I think you should have the option to sneak around but honestly it\u2019s not hard to avoid people and run away if you need to.
