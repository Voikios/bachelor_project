Viper7475,This is an animation right? It looks epic! Couldn't tell if it was the real game for a sec
wmaxwell1971,"Dead giveaway: there was no herd of cats following the buggy.  Awesome animation, though!"

cchooper1,"""How high are the spark plugs on this thing?""  
""Why do you ask?""

""Oh, no reason..."""
USBSocket,This has to be Ue5
Gokar257,"Very not realistic, needs dismantling and reassembling on land."
Matix777,This will be satisfactory in 2012
ImpossibleMachine3,Can't wait for my game to become a slide show every time water is on the screen!!
fieroman911,We need ue5 nannite is so good for LOD
AcceptableDurian2476,"Am I the only one that shouted out loud "" Don't Stop, keep going!"""

stevensh12460111,"Its after effects, notice the rest if the image is still except the water and the buggy. He just masked what was there and added those on top. Looks great tho"

KickBassColonyDrop,~~That's not water. It's a little too red and a little too viscous...~~
Iambecomelegend,"Man, its gonna be really cool when video games actually look like this in 10-20 years."
MrFrozenMan,"If this is Blender, I'd love to see a copy of this project and scene. Are you willing to share?"
cptspectra,Looks great. A stinger far away in the back scuttling by wouldâ€™ve been cool
