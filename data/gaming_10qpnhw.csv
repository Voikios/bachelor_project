NonRock,"I got inspired by an image of a hedgehog with sneakers. Original idea was almost like this. Main difference being Sonic's animal. It was either gonna be Tails or the lil guy with sneakers 

Settled on a regular one to contrast Shadow's animal better. Think it's funnier like this

HulluHapua,I'd imagine if in a future title there would be a powerful form for Sonic that's more powerful than the most powerful that's out there that makes him a giant ultra realistic hedgehog with blue spikes.
MagusUnion,"""That's interesting Knuckles, but tell me...

**Where's that DAMN Fourth Chaos Emerald?!!""**"
TheSaucyWelshman,"> Shadow the Hedgehog is a game that can be summed up by the phrase ""They made Sonic black and gave him a gun."" which isn't a great phrase but it is accurate.

Raze0013,The pistol needs to be pump action.
cthulhubert,"Something that always amused me is that a lot of people say ""spirit animal"" is cultural appropriation, but the earliest use of ""spirit animal"" in this kind of sense (tutelary/guardian/representative spirit) comes from The Golden Bough, where one of the big examples is actually European traditions of a witch's familiar. It was only later in the 90s new age revival that people started specifically claiming their ""spirit animal"" tradition was an extension of (some nebulous, syncretic) Native American one."
