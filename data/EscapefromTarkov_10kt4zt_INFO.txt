{"Title": "Unpopular Opinion: No one cares you are quitting EFT.", "Post Text": "It is probably not that unpopular of an opinion, but tonnes of people actually enjoy this game despite it\u2019s flaws.\n\nI don\u2019t care at all that your quitting, it makes no difference to the people that enjoy the game. The only people who care are people who have already quit and are sour, or people that don\u2019t actually want to quit but love to say they will.\n\n\nEdit: I do care about the issues, no I don\u2019t want the game to die, yes I am a sad boy, and I get the irony/hypocrisy of my post.\n\nThe devs have said they don\u2019t check reddit anymore, there is no way to verify people are telling the truth anyway, there is a channel to contact them to give feedback, posting stuff on here is for the other players not the devs. \n\nPeople saying they quit could be anyone just looking for clout. It\u2019s literally pointless\u2026", "ID": "10kt4zt", "Score": 1619, "Total Comments": 612, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10kt4zt/unpopular_opinion_no_one_cares_you_are_quitting/"}
