RoyalBookmark,"‚ÄúEveryone seems to have forgotten that there was a debt limit standoff in 2013 where Obama adopted the no-negotiation approach and prevailed with a clean debt limit,‚Äù he said."
Spin_Quarkette,"The very basis of the GOP's position is wrong on every level.  This money has already been spent (and a good deal of it was spent under Trump).  This is not the right place to have budget negotiations.  They should be negotiating spending during the regular budget development process.    What they are doing is unethical and it harms the country on so many levels. 

I am glad Biden is standing his ground.  No negotiations with terrorists."
SenorBurns,">His stance has drawn a rebuke from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who said he‚Äôs ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù but has remained steadfast in his call for spending cuts.

Yes, he is disappointed that Charlie Brown smartened up and he didn't get to pull the football away again.

Sad that one party has proven that it will never negotiate in good faith. The GOP is a rot eating away at the country's soul."

table_fireplace,"The best thing we can do is vocally support him, and anyone else who's refusing to hold the economy hostage. That includes Dems in smaller elections.

And those elections have real stakes, too. In just nine days, three special elections in PA will determine if Dems hold the State House there. In about two months, Dems have a chance to take control of the WI Supreme Court and overturn their gerrymandered maps.

No mention of how republicans don‚Äôt actually care about budgets. Whenever they have the power they cut taxes mostly on rich people and corporations and increase spending. No mention of donors either, but that is to be expected."
jdmorgenstern,"When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.

acapncuster,Republicans have a longstanding pattern in negotiations.  They write a long list of outrageous demands.  Democrats make concessions.  Then new demands.  The process drags on for months or years.  Then the Republicans vote no anyway.  It‚Äôs all a scam.  They are scam artists from top to bottom.

Lythieus,">Here‚Äôs the leader of the free world pounding on the table, being irresponsible, saying ‚Äòno, no, no, just raise the limit, make us spend more.‚Äô No. That‚Äôs not how adults act,‚Äù McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol last week. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find common ground, and let‚Äôs eliminate the wasteful spending to protect the hard-working taxpayers.

The irony here is the debt ceiling lift here is paying for the stuff passed during Trump's administration. He spent trillions on tax cuts for billionaires. Now they want to pay for it or of everyone else's entitlements.

This isn't spending for new stuff. This is paying for stuff already passed."
baguak4life,I think you could get most Americans to agree to spending cuts‚Ä¶.you know‚Ä¶.if it wasn‚Äôt taking away SS or medical assistance. These clowns can maybe stop spending absurd amounts on our military and maybe tax the rich and maybe fund the teachers that educate our kids and on and on and on. Jesus this country has turned into a three ring circus where the only thing that matters is making the rich more wealthy and making the middle class foot the bill.
Hiddencamper,"Brilliant

The GOP is going to have a problem with their donors if they cause the economy to crash. 

The speaker has no confidence and can‚Äôt get a vote together. The democrats are telling them to come up with a unified plan (which they won‚Äôt be able to) and ultimately break more confidence in the GOP and the party. 

If the GOP won‚Äôt learn how to govern or at least try to, then they need to keep getting these lessons taught to them."
kandoras,">‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the leader of the free world pounding on the table, being irresponsible, saying ‚Äòno, no, no, just raise the limit, make us spend more.‚Äô No. That‚Äôs not how adults act,‚Äù McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol last week. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find common ground, and let‚Äôs eliminate the wasteful spending to protect the hard-working taxpayers.

At least the leader of the free world realizes the difference between paying the bills for thing Congress has already demanded he buy and Congress voting to buy more stuff.

You've got a majority of the House Kevin.  If you think that spending should go down, then just stop voting to spend more money."
OTIS-Lives-4444,"He has also been influenced by foreign relations. I think he understands that there are rational actors (e.g. China) and irrational actors (Al Qaeda, North Korea increasingly), and you treat them differently. MTG, for example,  is not a rational actor. Nor is most of the Republican Party. Hoping that all the Republicans will come to their senses and not destroy the economy (i.e. behave rationally) is foolish. He‚Äôs negotiating accordingly. Sadly I think the wing nuts with drive the country over a cliff anyway thinking that will win them reelection.

Travelerdude,The House Republicans are in the majority. They are only using this as another tool to benefit the rich. They don‚Äôt care about average Americans. They are using the threat of economic ruin against the American people.
zzWordsWithFriendszz,"""David Schnittger, who worked as deputy chief of staff to then-Speaker John Boehner, recalled that in 2011, House Republicans could compel the White House to come to the table by securing enough votes behind their opening bid: attaching a debt ceiling increase to a balanced budget amendment.

pfroo40,"GOP has no problem with spending the money while they are in power, but they can't stand to pay the bills once a D is in office. Party of no responsibility."
Arkista_Tev,"The weirdest part about this is that the debt limit literally means nothing and is based on nothing.

Lot of people have a vested interest in making sure that American citizens think that for governments works the same way as household debt. They think that government income and expenses work in even remotely the same sort of way as they do for an individual with a job and so much money coming in and so much money going out.

It's infuriating. It's insane that we aren't taught at least the very basics of this sort of thing in high school. All the conversations surrounding things like the debt limit are intentionally obfuscated. Every single news agency doesn't report on it accurately. And no politicians seem to be willing to explain to people what government debt even means."
Vegetable-Two2173,"The budget was approved. The money was appropriated. That was the time for this. 

Fark the GOP and every last attention seeking act."
PillowPrincess314,"No need to waste time in negotiating. The GOP gave away their shitty BAFO (Best And Final Offer) before some of them were even reelected.

Raising the debt ceiling shouldn't be tied to anything but a mutual concern about the negative consequences of default."
actuallyaustin6,Kevin McCarthy thinking he has ANY moral ground whatsoever to talk about ‚Äúhow adults act‚Äù is beyond laughable. It‚Äôs insulting to our intelligence that he thinks there are actually Americans inexcusably stupid enough to buy that hypocrisy.
tinfang,Cuts are made during the budget. Approving a budget and then using the payments to cripple the government is wrong.
Mtbruning,McCarthy will be out by the end of June. His right won't allow the debt ceiling to go up without calling for a new speaker vote. There are at least 6 republicans that would cross the aisle to avoid a default. Those republicans from purple districts will likely increase their reelection chances by showing they can reach across the aisle for the right reason.
Kevin-W,"All he has to do is declare it unconstitutional under Section 4 of the 14th Amendment and order the Treasury to carry on. If it goes to court, it's not at their feet."

There needs to be more talk in legacy media about how what McCarthy and his friends are saying here is total bullshit. This is money the Congress ALREADY AGREED TO SPEND. THAT'S WHY THERE'S THE THREAT OF DEFAULT IF WE DO NOT RAISE THE LIMIT.

Also, the Democrats need to take this bargaining chip away from the Republicans for good. They only pull this stunt under Democratic Administrations. It's an extremely cynical tactic to cut spending that helps the groups their brand is based on hating."
zxcoblex,Funny how Republicans NEVER have a problem raising the debt ceiling when it‚Äôs a Republican President.
cdsmith,"More people should start asking a simple question:  If Republicans want to negotiate, what are they willing to give up?

* Republicans are demanding an irresponsible level of spending cuts that will harm the U.S. economy and hurt voters, because they believe it will help them in the 2024 election cycle.  Democrats definitely don't want that.
* They claim to actually *want* to prevent the United States from defaulting on its loans.  That's not a concession, then.  That's an agreement that we already have.

We're missing the part where there's something Republicans are willing to give up in this so-called ""negotiation""."
LadyBogangles14,"It‚Äôs not like the debt limit is new spending.  It‚Äôs not.

Objective_Ebb6898,"I hope Biden holds tight on this and comes out with 4 sane Republicans who walk into McCarthy‚Äôs office and tell him to stand down or you‚Äôre out as Speaker.  All they have to do is tell them refuse and we‚Äôre installing Jeffries.  Far fetched, but if we‚Äôre talking brinkmanship bluffing which McCarthy is trying do do with Biden who knows.  Regardless I seriously doubt McCarthy lasts as Speaking anyway"
Jerrymoviefan3,"When you look at the 24.6 trillion massive increase in our debt so far in the 21st Century some of the major contributors including the interest on them is the following:

Wars: 6 trillion

Bush tax cuts: 5.6 trillion and rising each year

Trump tax cuts: 1.2 trillion and rising each year

Bush Medicare drug plan : 1.0 trillion and rising each year

2008 Recovery program: 1.0 trillion

Trump Covid: 3.0 trillion

Biden Covid: 2.0 trillion

That totals to 19.8 trillion and the interest on that absurdly large amount continues to pile up.  A major part of the problem is that we used to raise taxes to pay for our wars but now we cut taxes and double our war debts."

spartan5652,My dream is this fractures the GOP with a group breaking off to vote with the democrats. The beginning of the end.
we_are_sex_bobomb,"Yeah, because the GOP lawmakers aren‚Äôt ‚Äúnegotiating‚Äù in good faith; they are holding our financial prosperity hostage unless we pay tribute to the oligarchs through tax breaks for the rich. It‚Äôs fucking tyranny by the standards of 1776. We shouldn‚Äôt be negotiating, we should be dumping their fucking tea in the river."
KTH3000,"Whenever the debt ceiling debate comes up I think of what Zod said in Superman II. ""I've discovered his weakness. He cares. He actually cares for these Earth creatures.""

That's why the democrats will always be at a disadvantage when negotiating with Republicans, bc they actually care how the outcomes will affect the country. The Republicans could trash the entire economy and give themselves a pat on the back."
supamonkey77,">The standoff raises the stakes for Biden and Republicans ahead of what Treasury says is a June 5 deadline to act or risk default. Democratic leaders in the House and Senate are backing Biden and demanding that McCarthy present his plan and pass it through the House before any discussions occur.  It sets the debate on a different trajectory than in 2011, when Obama tried to negotiate a budget deal with Republicans in exchange for raising the debt limit, which faltered several times and brought the U.S. to within days of default. It‚Äôs unclear how this one ends.


I suspect that house repubs will not be able to come up with a coherent plan/bill that they would be able to pass on their own. The Freedom caucus is too fired up and will just keep upping the funding cuts till even other more moderate repubs reject it.  

In the end, I hope, House speaker will have to get some Dems to move forward on a very straight bi-partisen bill. And if that happens, the freedom caucus immediately loses a lot of its influence and for the first time since I was an adult, it will seem like Dems finally grew some balls."
KnotSoSalty,"If Congress can‚Äôt even pass a bill I don‚Äôt see how we even get to a negotiating phase.  The hostage taker has to make demands first.  Right now they‚Äôve got the American economy in the trunk and their driving around town looking for a pay phone.

Mint the coin and let‚Äôs move on already.  The GOP still gets to shutdown the government later this year over the budget I don‚Äôt see any reason to let them double dip."
Glittering-Ad-4257,The debt limit standoff is that time in the political cycle where politicians sell call options and buy put options while they roil the markets with theater and foot dragging and increase their net worth immensely. Why is this disgusting manipulation of markets allowed to happen at every opportunity?
rocketpack99,"Let them own it and any consequences. If they take it too far, mint that trillion dollar coin at the last second."
yes_im_listening,The US does not negotiate with terrorists
The_Scyther1,I have zero faith in the GOP to bargain in the best interest of the voters. A hardline stance seems appropriate. Hate mongers whining about compromise and teamwork can fall on deaf ears.
Undeadhorrer,I like how McCarthy is framing themselves as adults when the opposite is true.  Adults pay their bills.  The republicans are the children trying to refuse to pay it till they get more ice cream
dickbutt_md,"The whole idea of using the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip doesn't make any sense.

Republicans should ask themselves: What if Dems did the same thing? What if they decided they also would use this to extract concessions from the Right?

If both sides decided this was a valid way to negotiate, the country would basically immediately collapse. So this is the Right basically holding all of us hostage.

Why do people vote for this?"

Yorspider,"Hmm...almost as if a certain political party is made up of terrorist, who planted bombs on the congressional steps, and violently tried to overthrow the government....."
Balgat1968,The only reason the Republicans do this is that they have the support of the media. The media will and does even now say ‚ÄúThe President is risking world wide financial collapse for not negotiating.‚Äù Nothing about the consequences if the Republican‚Äôs demands are fulfilled. Name two Presidents who left Office with a National budget surplus.
Cemanno,Don't negotiate with terrorists
Mysterious-Wasabi103,Republicans tend to underestimate voters. When the economy crashes because they were being thoughtless and antagonistic only their base is going to stand up for it. There is a solid chunk of voters in this country that help decide elections every year and although they may only make up 10 to 20% of the population at any given time. That's all it takes to shift an election outcome. They'll continue losing more and more if this is how they're going to be and just because 30 to 40% of the nation eats it up and probably blames Biden. We all know the truth. He's doing the best he can frankly. This is like thinking the Pittsburgh Steelers would be a Superbowl contender this past season if they only had the right coach. We aren't as strong as we used to be but that's not the end of the World.
