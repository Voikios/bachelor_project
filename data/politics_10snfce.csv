M00n,*The department pledged to continue the work until all separated families that can be found have the opportunity to reunite with their children.* In 30 years from now we will be seeing documentaries about children who suffered permanent psychological damage at the hands of Trumps administration. People will be shocked to learn that the U.S. government focible took these peoples children and intentionally separated them to be cruel.

Actual consequences?  Fuckin' crickets as usual."

faceintheblue,"This program of separating parents from their children without documentation is going to be remembered in the same way we talk about the Syphilis Study at Tuskegee. Except that was the 1930s.

FaktCheckerz,"Never forget this was a crime against humanity. Conservatives supported it. Even your so called “moderate conservative friends”

Stock_Rush2555,"This needs to be made into a drama doc, like the recent Jeffrey Dahmer series. I guarantee it would make a compelling story, and if done right, it would reach even strong trump supporters just by virtue of it's entertainment value.

TheAskewOne,"Contrarily to what the aryicle stars, they were not crossing illegaly. They came as asylum seekers, which is legal. Many (all?) of them arrived at official points of entry.

SunMoonTruth,Typical go to of Christian nationalists is to steal children.
Theurgie,I guess the conservatives are ok as long it isn't their child or children.
cervidaetech,"I want to remind everyone here that Trump's ICE not only separated countless children from their parents, they then ""LOST"" them.  Trafficked.  They trafficked them.  But they called them ""lost"".  Then, in an absolutely astounding act of evil and affirmation of cruelty, they released the numbers to the public: [1488 lost children](https://apnews.com/article/immigration-north-america-ap-top-news-az-state-wire-ca-state-wire-aad956b7281f4057aaac1ef4b5732f12).

Yes.  That's right.  [1488, the same number literal nazis hold sacred.](https://www.adl.org/resources/hate-symbol/1488)

The depth of evil and abuse and violence the right has descended to should be SO MUCH more alarming to more people.  In case you think the assertion that the children were trafficked is alarmist please remember when they caught ICE transporting children without paperwork in the dead of night or keeping children in hotels without due process then sending them back to mexico with no transition process so they were essentially homeless."

wheelofka,Something tells me this will not be on many news stations tonight.
Infynis,Finally. This is why I voted in 2020
dtagliaferri,I will be enraged until the headline reads ALL!
VeterinarianFast9440,How about the DOJ criminally prosecute the architects and others who had a hand in this heinous crime?
Schiffy94,">According to figures released by the Department of Homeland Security, 3,881 children were separated from their families from 2017 to 2021. About 74% of those have been reunited with their families: 2,176 before the task force was created and 689 afterward.

>But that still leaves nearly 1,000 children. Of those, 148 are in the reunification process. The department pledged to continue the work until all separated families that can be found have the opportunity to reunite with their children.

Ugh, close but not close enough to fixing this mistake."
ABC_Dildos_Inc,Remember when the Trump administration claimed that it was impossible to reunite the families?
charonn0,"Just a reminder that because the separation policy was specifically designed to deter certain kinds of people from seeking asylum, these kidnappings qualify as a crime against humanity under international law."
MrD3a7h,Why do we always have to clean up after Republicans? Getting tiresome.
l_a_ga,"A whole bunch of them were trafficked to the upper Midwest to work the overnight shift on meat packing plant floors. It was only uncovered when one of their middle school teachers called CPS because these kids were coming in with severe chemical burns on their hands and arms. And, yes - after working the overnight shift cleaning a meat processing plant floor, these kids were going to school all day. The youngest was 12."
RoachBeBrutal, Because it’s the right thing to do. Well done. Still going to be a long road toward healing for those poor kids.
shapeofthings,I'm still stunned nobody has gone to jail for this and that the US public did not draw the line at this. It is sickening.
reynoldsunbound1937,We don’t get credit for fixing our own fuckup
sunnydaysahead2022,It is SHAMEFUL how these people were treated.
dokikod,That is wonderful news.  Trump and his administration were so evil and cruel.  I can't imagine how anyone could be so heartless.
lemmecheckit,How many of these kids were molested by Trump supporters? Not zero.
wagadugo,"It's crazy to think if Trump was still POTUS, these (and likely many more) kids would still be lost."
ShakesbeerMe,"Not enough is made over the evil that Trump and Stephen Miller committed during this fiasco. 

Objectively horrific, vile men."

eq2_lessing,"This is real oppressive fascist shit, my dear Americans. Except those who should hear this either won't read this or don't have a problem with it..."
athensugadawg,This probably puts SStephen Miller in the deepest of funks.
MrBrownMilk,Stephen Miller needs to be permanently attached to this heartless decision.
Sanctimonius,Genuinely good news and a step towards righting an intentionally monstrous act.
TorePun,how many more are there?  how many were raped?  how many died?
velazquezisabella,It's good to see the nation moving closer to its founding principles.
thesnuggyone,"If this is true, it’s the only news I heard today that I give a single fuck about. Wow. YES. Keep going. 100% reunification."
gadafgadaf,This chapter of Trump's presidency was truly mask off evil from the party that professes that they are the party of morals and family values. Before this people could argue that they could be afforded the benefit of the doubt. I kind of knew that Republicans were trolls and bad faith actors but then after this I knew that they really have no bottom line with how low they are willing to go. Truly evil what they did to those desperate families and kids when it would have been the easiest thing in the world to just not.
Meaty4skin,There are still missing children.

Wut_is_Dis_Crap,Trump reign of terror was so barbaric.
cmgchamp2,Thing is. .....Republicans are probably unhappy about this.
Weekly-Mode-634,This definitely put a smile on my face! :)
BrownEggs93,US reunites nearly 700 kids taken from parents under ~~Trump~~ **the republicans**.
was_and_wasnt,Somehow trump will take credit for this.  He'll say something like how much better he made those parents appreciate their children and the children their parents.  Ugh.
thatnameagain,"How I fucking wish ""Kids in cages"" never became the misleading rallying cry against Trump when ***kidnapped children*** was the more accurate description of what the administration was doing that needed to be stopped immediately.

How many times have you seen some galaxy brain talk about how ""Oh nobody says 'kids in cages' anymore now that it's ok Biden is doing it!"" Yeah it was a stupid and inaccurate criticism to begin with, because any kind of policy of detaining people caught trying to cross the border illegally will fit the ""kids in cages"" meme. 

The entire reason people got mad at Trump beyond the border wall nonsense was because he specifically ordered a family separation policy that was designed to function as a cruel deterrent to immigration. The Obama administration was forced to adopt a family separation policy because courts ruled that minors could not be detained with adults when detained by ICE, but the Trump administration embraced this policy and added on kidnapping and forced separation *across the country* which resembled human trafficking more than any kind of immigration policy.

And yeah, Biden is reuniting people while still maintaining a policy of not letting anyone cross the border anywhere at any time for any reason. We can talk about the ethics of detaining people caught trying to cross a national border illegally, and we should. But its an entirely separate discussion from whether one should steal their kids and ship them across the country and throw away the records of where they went."
Joji_Goji,Another horrifying legacy of the US.
thebardbecoming,The damage has been done. It's literally the least we can do is *give them their children back..* I can't even believe that sentence needed to be said. Fuck Trump.
tadysdayout,"Finally, someone thought of the children"
427WTF,Yet another crime that orange gasbag will never be punished for…
MedicateForTwo,This is not the same war crime Russia is doing in the Ukraine.  It's a completely different war crime.
redneckrockuhtree,It's sad and despicable that this is even necessary.
Loztblaz,This post has about 670 comments. Imagine if every single one of them was a family reunion. Heartbreaking cruelty from the last administration.
Pale-Lynx328,"The Trimp administration did a lot terrible things and had plenty of awful, harmful policies. But this is one of those times when it crossed the line into *literal evil*."
ssbm_rando,"I figured this was happening in the background but damn it's heartbreaking that it's taking this long because of how thoroughly Trump fucked up any semblance of process for the DHS

Like don't get me wrong, anyone who works for ICE is and always has been a disgusting pig, but they used to be disgusting pigs bound by similar levels of US bureaucracy as the rest of the government"
Special-Literature16,This was a very good thing to do and the media isn’t talking about it.
Haunted_Optimist,This needs to be bigger news
rkicklig,"What the hell AP, it was the US under Trump too. Maybe a better headline might have been ""Biden admin reunites nearly 700..."""

Lofteed,"I want to know how many are still separated.  
Everything else is not good enough."
DaddyDontTakeNoMess,I feel for these kids (and their parents). Many of them have been sexually assaulted because no one was there to protect them.

Urfaust,"It is a great labor to undo great evils.

delcodick,It’s a good start
dogfoodlid123,"Is trump a Russian spy?
A global traitor"
donrhummy,When will the real criminals be put in jail?
bmwk75s,very nice to see this happen and hopefully never happens again.
buried_lede,I pray the remaining children are with US family members. This was an impeachable criminal act by Trump
Haunting-Ad788,This was by far the most evil thing his administration did.
MetalGramps,Now seperate Trump from his family.
trash-party-apoc,"I mean, damage done. If I was fleeing my home in terror from economic disaster, and the place I ran to stole my fucking kid from me, and I didn’t get them back for three years?…. I mean… that dude is a terrorist now. What is left in his life except to punish this country?"
yuletide,Lock him up
Adrianmtz8,Some good news
SomeKindaSpy,This is not enough.
redwing180,I was kidnapped and separated from one of my parents for a week when I was young. To be separated for such a long time… The shit is going to haunt those kids for the rest of their lives and they will likely hate those who put them through this. I know this firsthand just based how lost I felt in my experience.
videocasey,Some good news.
Jake0fTrades,"Oh, well that's good news."
nicethingscostmoney,But I was told in 2016 that Democrats were the same as Republicans.
fruchle,"What really, really grinds my gears isn't just the absolute shocking tragedy and inhumanity of this but that ***THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THE USA HAS DONE THIS***
