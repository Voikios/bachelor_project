Twinklingtadpoles,"I think we need to take a DNA swab on this guy, run his fingerprints, check for passports, ID cards, and see what lurks behind any National info he has like SSN."
Rep-Binks,Watch this guy be a full blown foreign plant and the GOP give him unadulterated access to classified material because McCarthy needs the vote.
BoyEatsDrumMachine,"“I lie constantly”

*Ohhh?*

“—to stick it to the libs.”

*praise the lord*"
goforthandconquer,He fits right in with Trump and his gang. Lying is the number one reason they attract one another!
MeasurementNo0,I think it would be easier to just report on the times George Santos told the truth.
jwteoh,"> Pro-Trump LGBTQ event

Wait what?"
hithisisperson,I wouldn’t be surprised to find out he isn’t even a US citizen
Arikel,"I know we made the “Santos doesn’t answer when called because that’s a fake name” joke during the House Speaker election, but I can’t believe we were basically right."
OohIDontThinkSo,"This guy is a true George Costanza. If you believe your own lies, they're not lies."
CandyCoatedHrtShapes,This is literally a national threat in office.  It’s insane this is being allowed.
imperatorbanana13,There are government forms requiring you to list your aliases or names you've gone by. If he hasn't listed Anthony Devolder on forms filled out after that event there might be penalties that don't need the Speaker of the House's concurrence on.
tkingsbu,Who IS this guy really?
FloralDamian,He was hoping John Barron would show up
Kossimer,Nobody who questioned if George Santos is actually his name was kidding.
RedRyder760,"Has anyone verified that he is a US citizen? If he says he is, it's probably untrue."
ASecularBuddhist,I wasn’t really into the ‘show me your birth certificate’ thing until now
kthulhu666,"For someone who lies about everything, Anthony Devolder is about the lamest pseudonym I can imagine. Was he pretending to be an insurance agent from the midwest?"
Joelnaimee,"Is this guy in the u.s. with legit papers, or did he forge that, too?"
bk15dcx,Are we sure this isn't Andy Kauffman?
FitziTheArtist,There are gays who put their money and prejudices before their community.
DRob2388,The whole santos saga is interesting. On one hand it’s amazing this dude was able to win an election when none of his credentials were legit. How did his opponent not find any of this out. On the other hand it shows that a large part of society doesn’t care if you’re a liar or scammer. Just as long as you an R next to your name you can’t be that bad.
OneMetalMan,Anthony Devolder sounds like a member of Voldermort's Death Eaters.
Ok_Ninja_1602,This has Vandalay industries written all over it.
Donkey_Kahn,What the fuck is a pro Trump LGBTQ event?? That's like chickens holding a pro KFC event...
Champagne_of_piss,"the people who 

a) gave this guy money

b) voted for this guy

Are the stupidest people on the fucking planet bar none. Rubes of the highest order. Apex clowns."
danranja,"He has at least three aliases according to wikipedia: Anthony Devolder, George Devolder, and Anthony Zabrovsky. His name is listed as George Anthony Devolder Santos. Devolder is his mother's family name.

He claimed to be biracial, claimed to have a brain tumor. It just goes on and on with weird charity and business claims and of course the college and work experience lies."

Double_Lingonberry98,"Apparently, his real name is Tom Marvolo Riddle"
WrastleGuy,"At this point I want to investigate why he hasn’t been removed from office yet.  Why is this taking so long?  He could be a spy for all we know, they didn’t even do a simple background check on him."
sucobe,It’s absolutely mind blowing that 1) no one including the media vetted this guy properly and 2) he is IN THE HOUSE and we have no clue who he is.
BeKind_BeTheChange,"I’ll bet anything that he isn’t gay. He’s claiming to be a gay republican because being a gay republican makes him a higher profile republican and he is nothing but a pathological lying attention seeker.

Have any men come forward claiming to be a partner of his? I’ll bet not."

Red_Eye_Jediii_86,Makes sense why he didnt answer to his name when they were calling the votes for house speaker.
theilluminati1,"You know, how sometimes certain people have this look - like in their face, just naturally - of a total scumbag?
 
Yeah, this here is the case study of THE look.
 
 McCarthy is a close second."
psycholepzy,Where was all this shit during his campaign?
cthulu0,Might as well said 'George Constanza introducing himself as Art Vandelay'
Dalisca,Devoldermort
Ok_Ninja_1602,This guy is going for some obscure Guinness world record.
,"If you write the letters of that name in the air with a wand and then rearrange them, it spells “I am Lord Devoldemort”

/s"
Lost_Minds_Think,"Why do conservative voter still think the media is to blame for the dislike of the the Republican Party? 
And why don’t they realize it’s the Republican Party that is digging their own grave?"
idoma21,People are going to lose their shit when he rips off his mask on the House floor to reveal that “he” is a Cherokee female dominatrix whose name is the number 8.
GetRichOrDieTryinnn,Pro trump lgbtq?
BenTCinco,His real name is Miguel Sanchez.
mejok,"This guy is wild and the stories just keep getting weirder.  At this rate, at some point a story is gonna come out that he’s actually the father of multiple children in Cambodia and at the same time, the head of some European cocaine smuggling cartel."
SpankBankManager,I won’t be at all surprised if his actual name is Art Vandelay.

I’m reminded everyday that there truely are some very stupid people on this planet."
Competitive-Ad-131,I like how the ‘pro-Trump LGBTQ event’ is the least interesting part of that head line

Vreejack,"One day George Santos will apply for a job while claiming to have once been a US congressman, and nobody will believe it."
Elgallitotorcido,"They should have voted him as leader of the GOP house, he represents them perfectly."
Pleasestoplyiiing,Who is Kaiser Sose?
bagb8709,I’m doubtful his name is George Santos at this point
AndreLinoge55,“Local 5th Grade Class is shocked to learn that last weeks Spelling Bee Winner Anthony Devolder was 34 year old George Santos in a Fortnite shirt”.
WrongSubreddit,"A habitual liar propped up by dark money, perfect for the current GOP"
strawkastle,This guy looks like some sort of villain from a live action Dr. Seuss film
DJBreadwinner,Tomorrow we're gonna find out he never existed in the first place.
iwascompromised,I have to get a low level security clearance for a job I’m going to be doing at work for a government client. I wonder how many lies I can tell and still get to stay in the project?
Odd_Sweet_880,Nothing in that sentence makes sense.
FriendOfDrBob,Who ever ran against this guy did the worst opposition research imaginable.
ges13,Like Saul Goodman minus the brains and charisma.
Salty-Paul,The death of Harambe has set us down a frightening timeline.

BT9154,"Next time he's gonna be calling himself Art Vandelay and that he's an architect, marine biologist, importer-exporter, author of ""Venetian Blinds"", and manufacturer of latex."
twistedandrogeny,"No one knows his name, his background is fake, he's a criminal in Brazil, he silently dodges accountability... Wouldn't it be ""crazy' if this freak is a spy from a non-friendly nation or a domestic terrorist carefully plotting to blow up Congress from the inside? You'd think they'd be a little more  concerned about background verification and references after 1/6/21..... 

With all the online and physical actions and extensive training and plotting these groups are involved in at any given time, what do you think it would take to ""sneak"" a kamikaze ""politician"" in the House who is actually a terrorist? What if he's on a mission, completely focused and dedicated to carefully and methodically doing what he believes it will require to become the ""martyr for the 'right' cause""???  No one knows who he is..."
Jaylaw,"Im not actually horse, im really a broom"
Bladeshadow,So.....How long until we find out he is actually 3 kids in a trench coat?
Acrobatic-Proposal26,This is some wild Tom Ripley type shit
Numb2E,Such a weird looking little weasel.
captainmcfuckface,I can’t even get a driver’s license without verification if identity. How the fuck is this even possible?
drbbanner0,"Once again republicans have elected a con man, how fucking stupid are these people?"
Ryduce22,"This guy is clearly a proxy Russian asset by way of Brazil. Our govt is infiltrated, rich oligarchs are trying to overthrow democracy, and the poor are being raped by rising prices and stagnant wages.

Something has to give. We are in a downward spiral and Americans are either going to shake off their propaganda, come together and right this ship, or submit to thier worst natures and paranoia and march foward into certain chaos."
shekyb,but didn t republicans do a background check on this guy before he ran? i mean a really basic check of school and work would be enough.

GhostCam,George “Ron Mexico” Santos
cheese8904,"If you're a voter and want him out - I would file a law suit.

beatlefreak909,I demand to see his long form birth certificate
infinitude,Really makes you wonder about who voted for him… how much of a careless moron do you have to be to vote for a guy with this obvious a record?
shiafisher,"Okay. . . Not to bring up birtherism but I think his constituents should request his birth certificate in FOIA, or whatever mechanism they can."
mancusjo1,Maybe this is a true case of a pathological liar?
MrFluffyPillow,Very likely why he was very slow to acknowledge his stage name during the House Speaker vote…

Edit:


And Bolsonaro, why is he still hiding out in our country?  Can Biden lean on that and get him extradited?

I’m ready for some bully pulpit action to address all of the shenanigans running rampant in this country.  This is an outrage."

Mr-Warmth,"This ""man"" is obviously a sociopath.

He should not have anything to do with deciding the fate of anyone, not even his own.

He should seek medical attention for his illness, as it is plainly obvious he sincerely needs help."
Chuckles52,"Republican speaks, Republican lies."
