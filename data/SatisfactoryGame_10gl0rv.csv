KishoreXD,I have been avoiding building a Heavy Modular Frames Factory since update 5.ü§£ü§£
guywth1mnth,"I just finished a baby factory, only running one manufacturer, not even overclocked, but it works for now."
Savie69,"All these images is me ""Imagining making a heavy modular frame factory and never getsting to it"""
Warhero_Babylon,Me every time i need to do something related to plastic or rubber production (i need also to create a turbo fuel factory on leftover purple oil becouse how can i waste it)
lilibat,Yeah...
dosenscheisser,Blueprints hehe
svanegmond,Do you have any hard drives? Because it gets a lot easier with a few certain alts.
PyroCatt,
Alexandre_Man,"I've done one, it's big as fuck and it's only making like 5 HMF per minute"
darvo110,"My first frame factory was like 5 floors all for one manufacturer with very few alternate recipes.

I made a new separate factory for fused frames after grabbing every hard drive and my god it is so much more straightforward when you take screws completely out of the mix."
BillytheBrassBall,"I'm just starting mine now, and I finally have a use for blueprints. I've spent the past two days designing and redesigning a dodecafoundry (12 foundries) so I can have an overwhelming abundance of raw materials. Planning is for nerds, just overload the circuits!"
Blueflatts,Let me stand there with you. Then maybe the winds will change for us.
KYO297,I don't know why you people don't like HMFs so much. They're like my favourite midgame part
TouchTop3378,"Yes. I have one manufacturer that creates them. All the time.. slowly, but its productivity has been good enough for now. Whats the deal? 4 components. Focus 1 component at time, eventually you will get it."
BroVival,I have to build a turbomotor factory and I'm more afraid of it than I was for the frame factory
mattrat88,Me literally last 4 days
kullre,It's so much set up for something so slow
tidematz,This is me waiting on my ADS factory to get me 4k items
azfrederick,My heavy modular frame factory was the last factory I ever built ‚òπÔ∏è
OxymoreReddit,Didn't play since update 4 but damn yes HMF factories are like 30 hours of building for a 0.02 HFM per minute in the end üíÄ
Skullz64," I‚Äôve built one, it currently has a whole industrial storage container filled because I don‚Äôt touch it often 

I have supercomputers working on the clock and fast"
Snoitaluger1292,"I hooked up a manufacturer to my central storages, hooked it up to 2 industrial containers, and went afk for a day and a half, got a good stock up of hmf now"
AegisZieg,Hahaha I am at that point in this save and... I run around to the nodes I need to tap...look at a central location...then save and log.
Konklar,"I'm currently working on a 20 per min HMF factory. Encased Industrial beams running at 4 per minute on assemblers. Why did I choose this recipe!  I know I could overclock them but, my personal rule is only overclock resource extractors."
M05y,I've still never made it past tier 3.
CapSevere7939,"I just put on my podcast Stuff You Should Know, and get to work. Definitely a grind though."
Kiu16,"I made one it was working and all but i did the mistake to let my friend build our power grid so it broke down and we never managed to fix the power source, now we need to rebuild all of the power:("
danque,"Take your time. Instead of building a massive factory first. Try making the resources accessable in large quantities. Then use trains or trucks (prefer trains) to transport the quantities of resources to a new location for heavy modular frames. 

I collect aluminium resources in one spot, transport the whole bunch to a warehouse and then transport it to the factory to be molded into Alu bricks.  All trash resources are put back on a train to the location where it's needed."
LuigisRandomPosts,Started mine two weeks ago and it is still unfinished lol. I‚Äôm currently 30h in and getting close to it‚Äôs completion.
gaudierlace8824,Well what you do is make blueprint models that make two components a piece and just place those two blueprints over and over
PolskiOrzel,Very*
playr_4,I just started working on mine....planning it out in terms of what to overclock and by how much and which alternate recipes make the most sense was really fun for me. Building it not so much.
iamthegordon,ah yes this is me
rogue_noob,"Mine is a manufacturer connector a pair of industrial storage containers and the end of both my steel production line and my mod frame production line. Once in a while I have to refill the containers, but it's good enough to get me to nuclear. Yes, I have unlocked nuclear, I also have all my materials to make a mega nuclear power plant wth two accelerators running at 100%. My heavy mod frames are still built in a single manufacturer feed by containers."
Pixelsock_,I don't know why but I actually enjoyed making my heavy modular frames factory. 4 per minute. Not turned fully on yet. Waiting for resources to overflow.
SoleTwentyCharacters,Wait till u get to turbo motors
Wonka_Stompa,"I‚Äôm working on a 60 HMW/min factory at the moment, and this really speaks to me."
