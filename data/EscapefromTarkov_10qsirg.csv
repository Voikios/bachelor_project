internet_please,"These 2 spawns are so fucking dumb. The map is gigantic, no need for them to be right next to each other."
DragonBallKruber,"People acting like he didn't just move 5 meters in 1.5 seconds to be headshot, no matter what he did the other player would have shot and likely killed him unless his gun jammed or something

Point is he shouldn't have to fight to thr death that early in raid"
SomewhatViL,"Im actually disappointed by how many people like these horrible spawns. Lighthouse, Shoreline and Reserve have one of the worst spawns in certain locations where you coinflip whether or not you're going to die in the first minute of the raid. The point of Tarkov is to make choices based on your goals. If you want to have PVP, you go to the hot zones of the map, if you you go to less attractive areas then you have a better chance of surviving. I genuinely hope that BSG will either remove some of the horrible spawns or at the very least lower the amount of PMCs that can play on the map."
KOTheSavage,"I don’t play reserve much on pmc but ran one last night. Got my bestish gear on and got ready for raiders. literally a spawn I’ve never gotten, white queen I believe? It was the building across from Med, was clapped in 5 seconds from the other side of a tree because the time it took me to run thru the gym and PMCs were already outside Med. Looking at the wiki maps, one had my spawn posted and I can’t for the life of me figure out where the other is considering how fast they were in front of that building."
sleepy_the_fish,"Idk why bsg has 1 terrible spawn on so many maps. 

Those 2 lighthouse spawns are a sin.  How could you have a PMC spawn behind a PMC.   The spawn on interchange where you spawn behind a PMC And you kill him as he runs up the ramp. The spawn on reserve, where you spawn in that bunker with the tank, and as you come out there's a spawn on your left and a spawn on your right and they are both looking at you, and you literally have to run in the most open field possible or just sit in that bunker for like 5 minutes into the raid."
BasicDope,lets just skipp the beach spawns and let everybody spawn on these two spawns and have free for all in the beginning of each raid!
aaronsisco,How the fuck did you even see that guy that quick?
AkihiroAwa,People in the comments are the ones rushing towards another spawns clearly
Shalashaska_99,[im still here waiting for BSG to remove the Hallway spawn in Factory](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1293526402/photo/mr-skeleton.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=hpPoBfbgJI8XE23cmRqbrJb4Hw9i3U7xDZ8swBAsLvc=)
Timwick_,OGs remember the Customs Tankers side spawn selection where you were guaranteed a fight right off the gate.
SnakeSkinBots,I rarely do Lighthouse PMC.  I get spawn rushed if I don't go hide in a bush for the first 10 min.
lbigbirdl,"I've killed a few people already this wipe who spawned where you did.  Basically if you get the other spawn, you hop on the rocks real quick to see if your free kill spawned.  

I think best bet is to rush uphill toward water treatment and get out of sight.  Don't try to sniper battle someone who got the spawn with all the cover and concealment.

I dont think they need to remove the spawns, but there should be something such that both can't be active at the same time.  There's a few others on different maps that could use the same treatment.  Emercom spawn and blue wall 50 meters away on interchange comes to mind."
Select-Cucumber9024,"This sub might be the worst I've ever seen for having someone point out a legitimate concern and shitty game mechanic only to be met with ""well actually you played wrong"" it's truly fucking cringe"
miguesmigues,"I agree, but this is an spawn killer getting spawn killed. You had other options"
LtProphet,"No, because this spawn creates the perfect opportunity to yell out “WHAT’S YOUR NAME” to the other player and hope he replies"
noplanman70,You moved to find him yourself with no cover and then come to Reddit to complain......you cannot deny you could of played that smarter or even waited a minute for him to look at not see you there....... I don't disagree the spawns are too close but fuck me...
Kongralof,"1. yes i agree theese two spawns are too close together and should be moved.

2. you were actively looking for the fight, moving towards the other spawn, moving into a bad position for it and lost. You got mad That you lost and came here to post this. 

You wouldnt if you won…"
Rut_Nasty2v,Haha I suck at this game and have never been killed there. You don’t need to engage every time.
Odd-Pick7512,"I'm of the thought that spawns should basically be completely random across the entire edge of the map. There shouldn't be spawn points. The entire edge of the map should give you a random spawn. 

Or honestly better yet you should be able to click anywhere on the radius of the map and spawn there. Want a high action raid? Spawn closest to high loot. Want to be left alone? Spawn near nothing and make your way slowly to loot. Accidentally enter through the ""fence"" and another guy is standing right there let the best man win.


That way you can't say ""I got the closest spawn to dorms, I'm safe to enter and hold an angle."" That's just broken. You also couldn't do what happened in OP and know certain spawns are certain directions and just take a few steps and see their body popped into the world. That's broken."
rodigo1,Where is he? Watched the vid 5 times cant even see him
1337Theory,"Reserve has god-awful spawns as well.  Really, really easy shit to catch in testing and they either somehow dropped the ball or consciously decided to not care for it (or worse, thought it a good thing - which is just *too* unbelievable)."
-Shibdib-,The spawns suck. But you choosing a video where you actively tried to fight that spawn but standing in the open like a moron was not the move.
BusterOfCherry,"I mean you chose to engage and lost. So if you won, you wouldn't be here to complain? Could have run the opposite direction, held a different angle for him to come to you, etc... The spawns suck but be better at putting yourself in the right position to win. You got out played. You both did the same thing."
drbr51,Spawns on all maps are back to the bullshit way they were a few wipes ago. It's like a circle jerk at the start of every raid.
answerstojay,My guy gets out sniped and cries lmao
Redlight078,Or if you spawn here either you know where too look to get an early kill or don't peek here. It's simple.
MarcusAurelius0,"I can't say I feel bad, you're looking for the other player."
AbsentOfReason,As above. These 2 spawns are a nightmare. It should not be possible to clash this quickly on a map as large as lighthouse. One of them needs to be removed.
acks19,The awkward crouch in the open toward a known spawn definitely isn't part of this problem.
Niitroglycerine,"You tried to kill the other spawn and lost

Gg"
Kuraloordi,"The point is good, but adding this video was pretty bad idea to enforce it. Simply because you lost a fight you took right at the gate -> Remove this thing pls.

But yeah. Spawns should never force instant fight from them, problem is that this map is so poorly designed that you see into other spawns despite the distance. So they should do something about landscapes or the spawns."
EngiNERD1988,why would you push the other spawn like that if you didn't want to engage them?
Scalptura,You wouldn’t be complaining about the spawn if you killed the other player lol.
Chaos744,"So - you also knew where the spawn point was and were looking for an easy kill, but then get upset when the inverse applies to you? 🤔"
xnatex21,"Easy sbih kills with that spawn. Sometimes you get it, sometimes the other guy does"
BigDickBaller93,"There is a spawn beside pinewood hotel on streets,

Its beside the side entrance at kilmov Street next to the bushes, there is a 2nd spawn at the corner of the pinewood building the other side of kilmov Street, you can be within 10 metres of each other within 5 seconds of spawning, and I'm pretty sure (havnt tested it yet) if you knew the exact spawn you can spawn, shoot through the bushes and kill one another in under 2 seconds

Also let's be honest this guy knew the spawn and went for the kill, if the other guy didn't know about this he would run straight down and op would have killed him and had a celebratory wank before sniping the rogues. Live by the sword die by the sword I say"
JiffTheJester,"Lol if this goes the other way.. no post. But yeah, terrible spawn points for such a massive map"
autismo-nismo,"That is probably the best spawn on lighthouse for me.

You spent way too long moving in an area with almost 0 cover and got spotted instead of pushing to the right side of rocks overlooking water treatment as well as being able to cover a push coming up near that. 

The problem wasn’t the spawn, the problem was your idea of positioning."
bballmanager,"I agree 100% you shouldn’t have to fight this early in raid - that being said - you CLEARLY look for the fight instead of realizing where u are and relocating. We can complain as much as we want, but when you actively feed into it, kinda your own fault my man."
Ibrenecairo,"I personally love this spawn, simply because of the amount of gear I get from tapping chads as soon as I load in"
Vicktlemort,Complains about spawns... At the same time tries to spawn kill LMAO
Istariel,"the same thing can happen at some spawns on shoreline, reserve, streets, interchange...

if you actually knew there is a spawn there then you shouldnt have played it like that"
physicsOG,and if you try to run away you just get shot in the back lol
VoidVer,"Uh oh, someone got screwed out of their camping spot too early in raid. 

Seeth and cope, you were setting up to kill someone running up from village who would have had the same experience you ddi to this guy. You know someone spawns across the water and got waxed anyway. You just want a free uncontested spot to sit."
Judge_Hot,"You knew there was a good chance of someone spawning there and then moved in the open in front of it, this can happen in literally any of the other maps, if you don't want to engage just run away, you had more than enough time, your movement and cover is bad, you weren't even behind a tree or bush"
chekkisnekki,"Lol skill issue. Not joking. You had two easy options, camp a tree and look left, or run right to the lake and look backwards/jump up and prone on the rocks by the lake for 5 mins to see if the next spawn followed you. 

And you picked option 3: crouch in the open at midday with no fog or rain against a spawn with heavy tree cover. Sorry op, but you played like shit"
robertlinke,"same on factory, that hallway has 3 player spawns, and i actually have had all 3 spawns active.

one on the end of the hall way, one at the factory carts and one at the pallets in the middle. guess who died really quickly"
ShatterSide,Not to mention the mines. I literally don't know where to walk to avoid the one-shot mines. I am enraged instantly when I spawn there.
Coldshowers92,Lol the reserve bunkers but hole in the wall are way worse than this.
BMWDUKE,Wow you played that so badly
tastywalls,"Unfortunately its not just this map either. Like others have said streets has some rough ones but also shoreline. I had a 30 second raid the other day, spawned in and took a few steps to be head eyes without ever seeing them."
brochochocho,"Well it would be a tarkov thread if I didn’t have sub room-temp IQ defending spawn rushing…

That fact that you can even get into PvP within a minute of spawning (apart from Factory) is just shit game design. These maps aren’t competitive and symmetrical with equal chances to engage and win. Some spawns objectively put you at a disadvantage by forcing to go directly into other people’s line of sight. That’s not good game design. You shouldn’t have to choose between sitting in a bush in spawn to wait for spawn rushers to leave or to take on spawn fights. 

If he didn’t take that fight he would risk getting shot in the back minutes within spawning. 

Seriously you braindead morons. Why would he not check that spawn? Of course you want to know if someone spawned just 100 meters from you and can shoot you in the back of the head. 

This game needs a rework of the spawn system with more randomization based on proximity. Shoreline and interchange are REALLY BAD for this. Streets and lighthouse are not great either."
loongod5,I normally say it as a joke but this is seriously a skill issue. OP your decision making is actual dog shit
SugahKain,This is an obvious spawn and you walked right into the open for him to headshot you. This is absolutely a skill issue
gimpums,Cry more. You chose to fight and lost
tipsykretts,"No you got out played by a better player lol , you knew where the spawns were and so did he you was doing the same thing he was doing trying to spawn kill him he just beat ya , you could ran another way or hid but you turned right to a spawn you knew and he knew there's a spawn where you are he won  the fight"
pasiutlige,"In every single map, you can reach other players spawn in first 15 seconds of the raid, be it Customs, Interchange or Lighthouse.

So I am not sure why exactly do you complain."
SonofRanman,"People here entirely missing the point that the issue isn't that ""You're Bad""  


You shouldn't even have the opportunity to PvP seconds into a raid like this. It's not fun on either end."
rodgers12gb,You literally tried to ambush and snipe the same dude who ambushed and sniped you...  you knew he could there and he knew you could be where you were.... you coulda not engaged... instead you literally went to the highest point to play sniper.... and he out sniped you.
Cubanned,I bet OP wouldn’t have been complaining if he hit his shot and lived
DelugeFPS,"You fucked yourself by trying to get greedy doing what he did, and you went about it in the dumbest possible way.

&#x200B;

Woods has been in the game since launch IIRC and it has similar spawn locations to this, if that has managed to survive more than half a decade as-is I really don't see BSG tweaking the spawns on Lighthouse because some guy got greedy, acted a fool and died for it."
Ancini,"How did you know to scope exactly to where he was? I did not see any movement and he was very well conceived, kinda sus from you."
fpsgamer2,"Cannot speak for LH as I don't play that map, but I get the same vibe with Customs and Shoreline there are some atrocious spawns, if I spawn in of them I just pray to all of the gods that somebody does not pepper me with BP or M80s. I hate that this is in the game hopefully they can either rework some spawn or just reduce the amount of spawn that are so close to each other. The fact that sometimes the success of a raid might depend on your spawn is kinda trash, that's pure RNG no skill no nothing."
trw419,"It’s to prevent a player from steamrolling the rouges in 10 seconds or setting up for other players. I get it, but my buddy died to a streamer who was on the far edge in a bush by the water there and it was extremely infuriating."
LogLow1420,"Yeah, the spawns can suck pretty much on any map. Maps are not big enough to separate the max amount of non-grouped players fairly. Unfortunately, I feel you would have to reduce the amount of players per map but I doubt most people would enjoy that."
Deimos_PRK,"I'm just saving this video to watch it frame by frame, I'm terrible at the game so I'm having trouble to see people 
u/savevideobot"
Joey-S-,Have died more times than I would like to admit within the first 20 seconds of the raid due to scuffed spawn points and sweats
top1Apelsin,"Yeah, some spawns are annoying, especially in these two there is almost always a person on second spawn. You can go ahead to the lake."
UghDragonNinja,"I'm a new player, level 5 at the moment.  
  
I didn't know you can spawn right beside enemy players like that, but I guess now I know why I died within 10seconds of spawning!  
  
Superb!"
metrize,just go the otehr way and farm rogues and extract. dunno what you're doing trying to spawn kill the other guy lol
NewHighInMediocrity,Lighthouse is my least favorite map just for this exact reason. I know as soon as I drop the raid may be over. Couple that with the rampant cheating on the map and it’s a lot to handle.
GahMatar,The fact that tarkov can and will spawn players in adjacent spawn with line of sight or near line of sight of each other is a problem. It forces you to clear the other one or start running in the opposite direction.
MrLuchador,Death Valley ☠️
mrbawkbegawks,to be fair that guy could have shot you like 12 seconds earlier just because you ran up that hill into the view of the other hill. you could have covered your body going to the side you spawned on
waituntilthis,Shoreline vibes
Orsim27,I mean look at factory. The map is cramped as is and you don’t expect to wait long for fights but spawning 3 squads around forklift and this window hallway is just dumb.
wisnia74,"I think that the fact, that both of those spawn points can be used simultaneously is bad. It kind of isn't that big of a deal if both of them spawn solo players and those players are aware of potential presence of an enemy on the other spawn - because even if you spawn where OP in this scenario, you can still move quickly enough for the other guy to now even know that you spawned. It's kind of a middle ground then.  


It becomes frustrating if you spawn solo where the OP and the other spawn is a duo/squad. Sure, you can still move quickly etc, but the duo/squad on the other side of the pond has all the tactical advantage right off spawn. If it's a duo they can simply chill and watch both angles, if it's a three-man they, 2 can pinch and 1 stays near his spawn on the lookout - the list goes on. The fact that a team can have such a positional advantage right off spawn is bonkers.  


I think that some of the spawns in this game should be ""disabled"" for a given raid, if a spawn near it is ""occupied"". This goes for those 2 spawns, some of the spawns on Reserve and Interchange for sure. But for the time being we just have to bear with it I guess."
smittyK,"Ya its pretty stupid that BSG decided that they would spawn more than half the server down in the southern road/long road area and make the only “main” POI water treatment plant. 

The whole server basically pushes in the same direction 

Its dumb"
gladbmo,I'm of the opinion there should be zero up there
AmbassadorOfZleebuhr,"You chose to engage and lost the engagement why didn't you just leave during the 24 seconds instead of staring at the dude?

Now we are blaming the game? LOL I agree that some of the spawns are fucked but this is an awful example of it. THis is just player error"
Massive-Map-5624,By reading just the headline I knew it must be lighthouse xD
Jotoz33_TTV,"Tries to use his spawn to get a quick kill, and get the player running out of the pond area. Gets to higher ground to make camping that spawn easier. Then he sees movement in the trees but don't retreat or get off the X, oh no! Knowing his enemy has the drop on him he just sits there and tries to make a flick shot. Gets rightfully tapped. After all of those terrible decisions OP comes to reddit and bitches about his low moral and low IQ play. 
I haven't played tarkov in like 9 months, but I love it here. Always something to laugh about"
Key_Transition_6820,Sounds like classic tarkov lol
bbbevy,rush the opposite spawn -> stand in the middle of nowhere sticking out like a sore thumb with no cover -> lose fight -> bad spawn bsg pls fix
LocksmithCharming790,New players are dying 24/7 on lighthouse they don’t know other player spawns. They are just running into your scope. The spawn under the helicopter on the street is dumb too. You can die there in 5 seconds too.
Phat_Sosig,"I mean yeah the spawn is bad, but your play is worse, this death is 100% on you"
HellsFrogs,Op is just mad he died doubt he’d complain if he got the kill.
onlychads1,Now get this spawn with a cheater at night time. You and your teammate die by thorax less than 20 seconds into the raid to see you got hit 8x of shit ammo to blunt damage. Just to open up reddit and see people go it's not the game it's the players. The issue isn't if he took the fight or not. The issue is spawn points.
madhatter275,You got a scope. Use it.
EscapeyGameMan,"Don't have to ask me twice. The other guy was streaming and said I didn't hit him.. Not sure how that works but yeah.

https://youtu.be/-I7l0Tu06wI"
SignalHamster,"this is fair, spawns should be farther apart or something, I don't know if theres a way to make it better but If there is i want it.

It kinda sucks because theres so much bullshit on lighthouse no matter where you spawn you are almost always pinched, if you spawn on the beach there are people in front and theres gonna be some coming up from behind, if you spawn on the opposite side you are a little safer with a little more time but not by much. its a cool map minus these issues, maybe they need to drop the player count by 1 or 2 to give pmc's a little bit more space, then again that might make it to empty."
MadDog_8762,"I think if Tarkov could move to a persistent raid system like the Cycle (where maps repopulate at a very slow rate, but players enter and leave at will) this would be fixed

The issue with “ready, set, go” type spawning, everyone starts with perfect, magical knowledge of where all other players are on the map"
Several_Promise_4528,But you have to apply damage to your brain….
dreadnogh,"Well you shouldn't expose yourself like that, when you know there is a spawn. Problem is you only have 2 options here. 1. Fight to the death, 2. Move towards rogue camp / trainyard (not very attractive).  


In my opinion they should remove the spawn your enemy had, since it's very strong against all other spawns in that area, you have the perfect position to take out early looters in village, and abandoned village."
Seanyboy2793,Agreed. I even think the woods spawns near the car extract are too close.
MapleYamCakes,"Last night I spawned into Lighthouse near the “Seaside Vacation” building, but somehow much further up the shoreline, in plain sight of the AGS Rogue.  I hear grenades blowing up around my character as I am spawning in, and I die instantly upon starting the raid.  It was less than a 1 second raid and I lost a 600-800k kit.  Incredible BEAR experience."
Sqweeg,"Shoreline spawns are horrible too.

Killed a guy after 25 seconds. I spawned in the village, he spawned at the tunnel exit. 

Other horrible spawns on shoreline, near the road to customs. i spawned **between** the train exit and the road to customs, I got shot after 14 seconds of raid by someone near the wall. (map's limit)

I can't understand how those things are still happening after years."
lxOLLYxl,"I don’t know what people want, Nikita has said since day one, he wants the game as hard as possible. If anything I see Nikita seeing this and adding one more spawn between these two lmao."
jonmoon04,why am i just now realizing you can put rangefinders on scopes
Drewbyhans,"Yeah we need a spawn point rework. Location that need to change for sure: reserve east lawn, railway interchange, streets theater. All terrible"
ThinkTwiice,I wish they would remove 2 player spawns ( one from each side of the map ) .  Which would spread the spawns out a bit more.  Less pvp.. no doubt.  A better experience? Absolutely
TheSm4rtOne,"I thought they removed it, every time i spawned there,   i scoped bit never saw another one"
PureRushPwneD,"https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/s4ioe7/when_you_just_want_some_fucking_ai_kills/ yep, I had this when spamming lighthouse a while ago too. fucking fantastic spawns"
StrawhatJzargo,How do you get down from this spawn? I’ve hit land mines going to water treatment 3 times trying to do corporate secrets and getting this spawn.
Wregzbutt,I genuinely struggle to find words fitting for just how unbelievably brain dead the spawns are on every single map (except customs cause someone with a functioning frontal lobe re balanced them last year)
xdarcy,"Honestly this has always been an issue and I don’t know if it can be fixed, sucks but most maps have relatively poor design for how spawns happen. You either get the god spawn and can rush loot or bottleneck spots and camp others coming in, you spawn in the back and have to be constantly checking corners/common camp spots and hope that people behind you don’t catch up, or in maps like shoreline/interchange you just know the spawns and pick people off spawns running across wide open fields to the resort/mall. If we ever get to a point where we have open world it won’t matter so I don’t think we will see any major changes and I don’t think they can honestly do anything without drastically changing maps or reducing players per raid."
marcelsins,You ever heard about streets? You had all the time in the world lmao
Bonus-Representative,This lasted 15s longer than my average Factory run
avowed,"All maps need better spawns, reserve is just like this."
RequiemAA,Lmao I knew this would be the lighthouse spot. Always look across the hill until I see someone or hear the mine go off.
Rebelpine,Don’t wanna PvP? Run in the other direction and get killed by the Rogues 😂
goodsnpr,You post this like Glass hallway can't get pinched super easy. BSG doesn't give a shit about player experience.
Crafty-Temporary-491,"Same with the back of oli on interchange. There is like 6 spawn points within 15 meters of each other. Spawn in and instantly feels like D-day. Not for me personally I generally just get head-eysed and carry on, but other people maybe."
SlyXross,"Yesterday, i went into interchange (hate that map by the way) thought i would a get chill raid, i spawned by the blocked railroad (not the extract one) and literally walked a few steps and right next to me was a 2 man, i didn’t even sprint half a stamina bar."
brochochocho,You should never spawn with a line of sight to other player spawns in this game. You should also not be able to obtain a line of sight within a minute of spawning. Easily fixable with map design or spawn point changes and spawn logic changes.
Fllaha,Get an influencer to talk about it.
moberry64,Spawn placement aside - how did he even see that guy? If the answer is that he expected someone to spawn camp there…why stand out in the open like that?
Supra_99,My brother in Christ have you played reserve? Fix those shithouse spawns first..
attomsk,This happens on so many maps - interchange - lighthouse - shoreline - reserve.  It’s not fun
0utF0x-inT0x,I'd take this spawn over some Reserve spawns any day though
GodIsEmpty,Which one?
imamunster123,"Spawns being that close is bad. That said, this is still a dumb play, especially if you knew there was another player spawn there. 

Both things can be true."
crazzedsmurf,"The fact he saw this man is telling of how skilled he is as a player too, so even really skilled ppl suffering on this spawn. My ass didn’t see ANYTHING. I would have rat ran right passed him never knowing and prayed he decided to let me live solely because he didn’t want my bank robber and pistol"
ProblemSG7,"Literally just died to this spawn, got a new kit together refreshed reddit during load screen and see this at the top of my feed lol. Smh this spawn is dogshit"
immaZebrah,Being able to memorize spawn points in a game like this is dumb
DisconapD,Also knowing the spawns are bad then silhouetteing yourself on the hill is a case of stupid games and stupid prizes. I remember and still get ptsd from some of the reserve spawns. So many bad spawns in this game ngl
TinyBrainProductions,Or... hear me out.  Don't force the spawn fight and go the other way.
Fgw_wolf,"Oh while we’re bitching about spawn points can we get fixes for customs, interchange, and factory too please for the love of god."
tIIzj,which scope is that?
NabuBot,Eh spawn is fine u just need to learn where it is also the person spawning higher up can just run ahead hugging left till the mines. Then the farther back guy basically can't push the lake without getting clapped.
Any-Description-2077,"We all know spawns are bad, but this guy intentionally stays in place and exposes himself instead of just running and setting up further towards the cliffs? People’s arguments about spawn quality and player behavior don’t have to be exclusive to each other. 

It feels like players on this sub like to find things to complain about because it’s the only way they derive joy from this game anymore. Not saying this isn’t wrong, but I see more complains than people praising or having fun."
