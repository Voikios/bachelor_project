BZA_Blaze,"So if you look at his FEC filings, which are public, you see a lot of whole dollar amounts, which stinks of fraud. These are for things like Ubers, convenience stores, gas stations, etc., places you NEVER see whole dollar amounts. 

But here is where the fraud sits in plain sight. You also can see he has a payment listed to the Capital Hill Club. Problem with that one is that the Capital Hill Club doesn’t accept payment from non-members. Santos was not a member when he claimed payment. This guy is a walking campaign finance fraud indictment.

Edit: changed FTC to FEC"
KickBassColonyDrop,"Santos' success reads to me like an experiment: ""how unchecked, open, insecure, unenforced, and exploitive is the American political system to push specific candidates into key positions to completely subvert the governing structure of the US.""

What happens to Santos now is irrelevant. The fact that he made it in with next to no resistance has probably given whoever was moving him like a pawn on a chess board invaluable information on the next BIG SHOW STOPPING POWER PLAY in 2024."
acatnamedem,This seems more and more of a let's see how dirty we can go and get away with it kinda play. I suspect that Santoss past was not as hidden in republican circles as they claim. This feels to much like a fishing attempt gone well and now they have no coherent plan for how to continue with the scam.
was_and_wasnt,"Santos was a small time grifter that all of a sudden got access to big money and campaign expertise.  That ""all of a sudden part"" bothers me.  Makes me feel like he's just a pawn being moved around by outside forces.  Forces that would rather see a republican majority and Christian rule in this country."
Appropriate_Mess_350,"And all of this constant corruption, although immoral, often seems to be completely legal in America."
archypsych,"Every single elected member of government should have immediate, complete and transparent release of their finances. And they shouldn’t be able to trade off their portfolio. Automatically."
masstransience,Reminds me of how Kavanaugh mysteriously paid off huge debts right before going up for the Supreme Court.
Zerowantuthri,"Uh oh...he broke campaign finance rules.  Now he's in trouble! (not)

I honestly cannot think of anyone who has run afoul of campaign finance rules actually getting in trouble."
geoffvro,"He is compromised, and probably a Russian agent.  The GOP would be dick-brained to give this guy access to any intelligence"
FearCure,"Dont be so hard on George.  He had it tough growing up - his father was a gay muslim alcoholic who beat George everyday until he found the Lord and converted the family to Judaism.  His great grandmother helped mother Theresa on her daily chores,  and his grand father fought at Omaha.     And his mother helped pen the code that made Apollo 11 mission a success."
mrequenes,TIL there are still rules that govern political contributions. SCOTUS will have to get on that.
Searchlights,"> According to financial disclosures that he filed as a candidate, Mr. Santos claimed that he went from earning $55,000 to running a company worth more than a million dollars in just a few years. That ostensibly enabled him to lend his campaign more than $700,000 — slightly less than the amount that RedStone Strategies claimed to have raised.
  
They won't say it because they can't prove it but the implication is that RedStone is Santos.  He set up his own fake organization to do off the books ""fundraising"" so he could donate that money to the entity that is his campaign.
  
It's a fraud all the way down."
FortySixAndYou,Smells like Russia.  Cheap spending to undermine democracy.
JOExHIGASHI,This must be why Republicans blocked the bill that allowed campaign donors to be known to the public
terror_rizing,"He’s definitely a foreign asset. If he’s not currently already an asset, he’s the easiest blackmail asset for foreign interests in all of government. He’s compromised, he’s a criminal, and he belongs nowhere near a seat in the federal government."
BeKind_BeTheChange,"Remember when Alito said that CU wouldn't cause this sort of thing, and even made a disgusted face at the suggestion? Pepperidge Farm remembers."
CliveBixby22,I'm so fucking sick of these shitty people
Unshavenhelga,This guy is a poster child for the repeal of Citizens United.  He's totally funded by dark money.
wheresabner71,Does the law even fucking WORK AT ALL anymore? Fuck this guy.
StillBurningInside,He’s a patsy that thought he was the smarter con man. The pack of wolves he got involved with are about to eat him alive .
Mushlover14,"> Another potential area of concern about RedStone Strategies was the way it was described in its donor solicitation email as a 501c4 — a type of tax-exempt group organized for the promotion of social welfare. These entities pay no federal taxes and may engage in politics so long as their major purpose is not electing candidates to office. But while the donor email describes the group as a 501c4, it also pledges to dedicate “all its resources” to electing Mr. Santos — language that Mr. Ryan suggested was troubling.

They’re just…doing it right in front of us. And no one cares."

Hardcorners,"Money questions aside for a moment, here’s possibly the worst part….’What don’t we know about Santos’ sordid past’?"
Demonking3343,My money is it’s from Russia. Though it’s pretty surprising they even have any money left.
CaptainAHav,"Look how easy it was for somebody to blatantly lie, get caught lying and then still win his election. What’s stopping a foreign agent from running on a totally fabricated platform if there is no accountability to the truth? Apparently the GOP cares about winning over truth. Otherwise this fraud would have been ousted day one"
RhapsodyInRude,Paywall bypass: https://archive.is/iz9lr
Refried__Dreams,"Gee, I fucking wonder. It's a goddamn Scooby Doo mystery."
honeybunny95,"I think it was more underhanded stuff from lowlife Republicans and not Russia that funded this guy. I just don't see any known connection with Russia here. It looks like most of it is connected to that Ponzi scheme he was involved with and probably an attempt to grift by influence peddling. 

The real question is ""who gave Santos the $700+k that he self-funded the campaign?"" Dude couldn't pay his own rent."
Trucker_w_cancer,"I’ll bet $1,000 he is funded by the Kremlin."
zestzebra,"If one lies about elements of their background on a job application and it's discovered, we all know the ramifications.

-SCOTUS, actually"
tazebot,">The donor, who did not wish to be identified, confirmed that he was told by the Queens Republican operative that the $25,000 that he gave to RedStone in October would be used as part of a large ad buy for Mr. Santos.
>

>But the donor said he did not hear anything back on how the funds were spent.

A fool and their money . . . ."
EudaimoniaDude777,Repel Citizens United!!!
Astro_Astro,I am shocked that a white supremacist grifter in congress has connections to… bad people with money.
so_hologramic,Santos has some unsettling ties to right-wing extremists. [Thread] https://twitter.com/lukeobrien/status/1613561584181280778?s=20

And of course it’s slightly less. I’m assuming that went to his rainy day in a no extradition country fund."
BoosterRead78,Russian money
JJDude,Spoiler Alert: It's Russian.
VaderHadNoFriends,How is this guy still in office?
sssddmm,Ru$$ian
,He’s a plant. Get rid of him.
konorM,Typical Republican. They gladly accept him in spite of (or because of?) the constant lies.
supcoco,Why does he always look like a creepy priest who’s about to get busted in a Dateline sting
-686,Dude’s a straight up clown 🤡
Hotpwnsta,"Obviously bought by China and or Russia.

Remove this fucker from the office."
fifthstreetsaint,"Too lazy to read the article, but I'll bet they don't even mention the 2010 Citizens United ruling that led to all this mess.

Time to stack the SCOTUS folks!

It's that or full on fascism."
WritingRites,"Watch, my fellow Americans, as fascism and corruption proceeds to fester and grow in our government while we can't do anything about it."
PaddlingAway,Dude is probably a Nazi or foreign asset.
Krojack76,How much you want to bet if he gets away with all this that more GOP will start following in his footsteps?
MoonBatsRule,"None of this matters anymore, because Republicans will not turn on other Republicans. You can't prosecute him because it would be ""political""."
biggerrig,I feel like This is a direct result of Citizens United decision.
Stunning-Fondant-733,Follow.the.Money everytime
Ok_Ninja_1602,The Republican controlled Congress will absolutely investigate Santos to see how he was able to do this to add to the playbook. It might work a few more times in Nassau County but it's a definite playbook in the South for grifters.
Sorcererslk,"Pathological
Liar thief and criminal. On brand for GOP"
,[deleted]
hawkman1000,"He is a threat to national security, but R's are fine with this because they want to keep a locked in vote rather than risk the seat going to a Dem."
god_Boi,The poster-child for Republicans power grabbing mechanics right there. Citizens United v. The United States open the floodgates to this shadowy machinations—Santos using it the way he did just goes to show the shamelessness by which it operates
shadowdra126,This dude fucking blows and needs to be removed from office and sent out of the country. Full stop
J032194,This is why we need bills to abolish lobbying and insider trading in congress. Once the big money stops flowing we will find out who’s in their seat for the right reasons and who is there to get rich and stay out of trouble.
VenomXII,Does anyone have a link that isn't behind a paywall?
GrumpyAtheist,Foreign governments have learned that the GOP is for sale for a very low price.
Lighting,I wonder if that same fund is tied to McCarthy given his support of a clearly unethical actor.
usernamewamp,I wonder if McCarthy will protect this guy when it comes out he’s being funded by foreign agents.
EFT_Syte,"Man Ruzzia is everywhere, fucking crazy. And the gop sold out America to them. Great job owning the libs guys, you’ve surrendered to Ruzzia."
Slipped_Diskette,"He's up for sale, he will go far in that party."
Artemis-1905,"And Kevin McCarthy was just on TV stating that ""we have a constitution"" and Santos was ""elected by the people"", yadda yadda...  ignoring the part about the lies being what got him elected.  (but in the next breath complaining about stored documents that Biden didn't disclose publicly before the mid-terms)."
Marshlm10,It always goes back to the fact this will continue to happen as long as those doing it are the ones setting the rules. There is no punishment because they’re all complicit.
Hour_Landscape_286,Ah yes the “definitely not Russian money” fund
Mindless_Expert3062,Santos is a Russian plant
cherish_ireland,"He's like their token black guy pawn and shouldn't be there. They are trying to not look like an oil and gun funded white nationalists group, who want to remove human/voter rights systematically."

TarmacTartoo12,Disgusting that these GOP scumbags are voted in just because some won’t vote Democrat ever!
ordinaryhuman89,"Any other career, you’d likely be terminated real real quick. But not the American government."
Hendursag,"EVERY ONE OF THESE STORIES SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BEFORE THE ELECTION.

This is all data that was available well before the election. The fact that it's only being reported now is an indictment of the US media ecosystem, where this obvious fraud was never covered until it's too late.

The FEC is 4-4 tied between Republicans and Democrats, and will never do anything about this fraud. The GOP in the House will never do anything about this fraud.

This is closing the barn door after the horse got out. Actually, it's more like pointing out the open door, but not actually doing anything to make sure the next horse doesn't get out."
clubpack,"So are there other George Santos' hiding in the current congress ranks?  

Is anyone digging into the others to make sure Santos is an isolated incident?"
xultar,Where was all this ace investigative reporting during the campaign?
The_Pandalorian,"The thing is, nothing's gonna happen. Accountability is for the powerless and nothing in the last six years indicates that will change anytime soon.

Our justice system is designed that way. Until we tear it down and rebuild it, we should expect nothing different going forward."
Old-but-not,"This guy is so wildly corrupt, and likely insane, that he is my new political idol.

I’m going to make a linked in that says harvard then Yale law, svp at google and apple, add a few social justice themes and then I’ll run for my town council. Get me some of that lifetime pension and healthcare!"

mt8675309,We’re about to find out…
UltravioletAfterglow,"The website for the [“mysterious, unregistered fund”](http://www.redstonestrategies.com/) is comically amateurish. From the punctuation errors, made-up words (“ …  individuals who have been **experters** in marketing …”), weird syntax, frequent use of exclamation marks, inconsistent tense, basic template layout and repetition of content on every page. I wouldn’t be surprised if he made it himself."
oldwedgie,It's called Russia
SporkOfThor,Dark money for dark souls.
CrisBkind18,He is a Trump puppet! Planted yes man
belliJGerent,My new favorite politician to hate. Fuck this lying asshole.
dale_downs,He’s a spy
sjcrva,"Does anyone else think this mysterious third-party ran him as a candidate to litmus test the fragility of our democracy? 

Also, the balls on those in NY who did not call him out from day one. How can the head of Nassau County GOP go on live TV and deflect responsibility when he himself vetted Santos yet did not bother to confirm the details? It’s absurd. I mean I get that he’s a boomer but doesn’t someone in his office know how to use the internet?"
Sbornot2b,"Is it any wonder the internet is essentially a right wing propaganda machine when all the crazy right wing shit is free, but anything with actual journalistic standards is locked behind a paywall?"
darkdividedweller,Lemme guess....Russian Olys.
admiraljohn,"And there's no way the GOP leadership will hold him accountable. My guess is he was told that he will never vote against any GOP initiative and as long as he doesn't they won't press him on his lies. 

And can you imagine if this had been a DEMOCRAT? The GOP members of the House would be apoplectic."
Sithlourde666,Since day 1 I was saying he couldn't of came up with this scheme alone there were others involved that helped him say and do whatever he needed to win. He just seems like a aggitative character to get clipped and plastered all over the place the same way MTG is or any other performative politician. He claims being jew-ish Flys a WP sign gets clipped gers articles he's a literal jester for people to write about shifting the focus. How he slipped through everyone's fingers to get where he is I find interesting it's not that too much reporting on Trump or the Govenor race was sucking all the air out of the room it just seems he told the right lies that eventually caught upto him after winning.
kudles,Santos is a loser but pretty much every politician uses SuperPACs and 501(c)s to get secret donations from corporations. How else would the be able to pay for the exorbitant cost it takes to be on a congressional committee???
BlueTeamTV,I wish the media had this coverage on Santos before the election.
GaucheAndOffKilter,"Obviously he is a pawn. 

But what I'd like to know is who is the man behind the curtain? Someone is devising these grifting schemes, and there's a lot here that supports a bigger network of money and influence. 

We need an Erin Brockovich to blow this wide open."
snewz404,White nationalists. They are funding him.
aristotle93,"It's crazy that the party of the GOP, with the largest population of skepticism for government honesty and ethical decision-making, would literally have a lying criminal than a Democrat or independent just in the name of holding onto power. They don't even need his vote."
nicholasgnames,New York Times really aggravates me.  How did I reach my limit on free articles when I have seen that message every single time lol.
pygmymetal,Santos says he fought Chuck Norris and won.
BlackGuy_PassingThru,"I feel like every day I wake up now, I see this guy’s face and the article is headlined “but wait there’s more”"
Narrator-to-gods,"Congress members allowed to trade stocks, Super PACs and secret groups. The corruption in American politics is hiding in plain sight and you know it because every member of congress pretends none of it is a problem. And we know that they only ignore the real problems and pay attention to things they create that they want you all to follow along, instead of seeing the obvious. 

Outlaw all congress from stock trading. 
Outlaw SuperPACs and secret money donating. 
Outlaw gerrymandering.
