charcoalist,"The Saudis weren't handing over billions because they liked trump's personality. What did donald, Jared, and Mnuchin, hand over to the Saudis for $3,000,000,000 +???

The former president, his thin man consigliere, and the former Treasury Secretary, received over $3 billion for what exactly? Any other government employee doing this would be under a fucking microscope, if not arrested, and rightfully so.

And guess what? When someone pays you to do favors that makes you their agent. These individuals should never have access to national security clearance again, and this is why they never should have had it to begin with."

>Trump’s business relationships with the Saudi government — and rich Saudi business executives — go back to at least the 1990s. In Trump’s hard times, a Saudi prince bought a superyacht and hotel from him. The Saudi government paid him $4.5 million for an apartment near the United Nations.
>
>Business from Saudi-connected customers continued to be important after Trump won the presidency. Saudi lobbyists spent $270,000 last year to reserve rooms at Trump’s hotel in Washington. Just this year, Trump’s hotels in New York and Chicago reported significant upticks in bookings from Saudi visitors.

Lurker-DaySaint,Tf is an investigation gonna do? Trump’s probably the most “investigated” man in history and no law enforcement mechanism has the fortitude to indict.
captainjackass28,He should be investigated for every crime he did and brags about but he’ll have a hissy fit so he should be allowed to do whatever he wants.

expatdo2insurance,He should already be in jail for dozens of reasons. Investigation is pointless when there's no enforcement.
MTLWATTBRICK,Waste of time. Trump is sadly untouchable

MescudiHelios,"What’s the point? We’ll hear news stories and read articles about it for a couple weeks, move on, then repeat the same thing. Whether Democrats or Republicans are in power this country does not hold anyone with money accountable for their crimes. Along with the rest of the country, I am tired of hearing about this orange imbecile so please, Garland, do your damn job and indict the criminal or move on."
AP3Brain,What is the point when they find all the evidence they need and still do nothing about it? Presidents are untouchable unfortunately.

Jenovas_Witless,Can the trump crowd and the biden crowd just investigate each other into irrelevance/non existence?
whyreadthis2035,But the republicans control the house. They won’t act. I sure hope the DOJ is staffed. The most amazing thing about investigating Hunter Biden is not concurrently investigating all trumps children and their spouses.
jmremote,He will never see any repercussions before he is dead so investigate all you want but know that it will never happen

Olderscout77,"Burisma Holdings was not under scrutiny at the time Joe Biden called for Shokin to be removed, per the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, an independent agency that has worked closely with the FBI.  
  
In 2014, Shokin had investigated Burisma for money laundering and tax irregularities, per USA TODAY.  
  
The probe focused on 2010-12, according to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau.  
  
Hunter Biden — who joined the board in 2014 and served on it until early 2019 — **was not the subject of the investigation.**

10/13/2022: The head of Burisma Holdings, the energy company on which Hunter Biden served on the board, has been indicted by Ukraine’s Office of the Prosecutor General for money laundering and corruption, according to Ukrainian MP Alexander Dubinsky. Strange behavior IF they had been pressured by the VP to go easy on Burisma, a VP who in 2 months would be POTUS who would begin massive aid the Ukraine. Obama officials met with Ukrainian officials in 2015 **to urge them to cooperate in the prosecution of Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky as the Obama administration sought to clamp down on corruption rampant among Ukrainian oligarchs.** That's the same year Trump and other Republicans have alleged Biden was trying to help Burisma."
EinElchsaft,"So, everyone agrees that he'll never be held accountable by the US justice system, right? Here's a radical idea, vigilante justice."
ruthejef,Oh boy. Another investigation.
CoolAnthony1,We get something like this once a month.
SnarfMasterflex,What’s the point?
Embarrassed_Hair_952,everything is so that he does not go to the elections of 24
TerrisKagi,"Who even cares anymore. He's still free, two years after attempting a coup. He'll never be brought to justice by the US because he's rich, he's white and he's male.

And what, I'm supposed to believe that this is going to be the thing that 'brings him down'?"
Comfortable_Gain1308,He did it ! Stop investigating and lock up this old sack of potatoes . It’s that simple !!!!
3rn3stb0rg9,This could get interesting...
Mad-farmer,I enjoy how people pretend that this orange shit-stain will ever get what he deserves because it makes them happy for a moment.

iNoo00ooNi,"Why waste the money?  We have him and Biden both mishandling classified documents, and neither of them have been arrested or charged with anything.  It's obvious the law doesn't apply to them."
shamalonight,How do you know when the Biden document scandal isn’t going away..impeach Trump 3.0
vicariouslywatching,Congress won’t investigate this. They are most interested ~~looking at Hunter Biden’s dick~~ Hunters laptop than anything involving investigating Trump
davilller,"Well, how else is he supposed to sell all those US secrets he hoarded."
VibeComplex,Another thing for authorities to do absolutely nothing about.

Goodly88,"What, that'll be his 8th separate ongoing investigation? 
You'd think with so many  people would actually admit his really is a failure."
P0pu1arBr0ws3r,"Because the previous investigations are over? At this rate he could just make new convicting evidence each week in order to delay any prosecution indefinitely, or at least until he can escape."

Kasey2023,"So let me get this right, a private citizen can invest monies to whatever they want but risk being investigated by the government, however the very government can turn around & use tax payers monies to payoff other countries to get what they want. Do I have that close?"
iWORKBRiEFLY,they can call for investigations all they want into this but we all know nothing's going to come of it
Masculine_Dugtrio,"It really bums me out that Biden picked up the ball and kept kicking it down the road, Jamal Khashoggi will never get justice."
Artistic-Cannibalism,What's the point of investigating this when we all know that Trump won't suffer any consequences?
BeastModeEnabled,We need a live tracker for the number of investigations involving Trump.
Emotional-Coffee13,If Trump became a Saudi Prince his worshippers would wear the gear in solidarity
Pvdsuccess,They've done everything but order to check the size of his pen**. Just go for that next.
MeetingKey4598,"You'd think Trump being financially married to SA would've been a deal breaker for his cult at any point the last decade but no, they'll overlook literally everything in the name of their orange god.

They fell in love with a coastal elite who would let them starve if it made him a nickel, or even just for fun, and they were and still are willing to compromise everything in their life to stay the course."
Unclebuttstuff,Chumpknuckle is asstrash
Blizky,More investigations 🙄
mombi,"I'm not American but... why a fresh investigation? How many have there been? I'm really not trying to neg anybody here but I feel I've seen at least a dozen headlines talking about investigations, indictments and inbound consequences for him so I'm confused what is even happening."
TheApprentice19,"Maybe if I don’t pay attention to this they will finally throw his traitorous orange lumpy ass in jail. I’ve tried caring about how many crimes we have this man dead to rights on, and yet he walks free. It’s not justice for all, when criminals walk free."
The_Pandalorian,Oh no calls for more investigations that will go nowhere.
Abracadabrx,An investigation to show that he committed criminal activity? And then what…? Watch as nothing happens for the 20th time?
skobuffaloes,The year is 3035 and after further revelations over the Trump administration’s handling of the {literally name something} a new investigation is opened in hopes that this grotesque mishandling won’t happen again.
coffee_67,Who cares????
EveryCell,How much more guilt and criminal behavior are we gonna tolerate?
ExampleMajor,Look at trump taking money as a private citizen... Forget about Biden stealing an unknown amount of classified documents while VP and leaving them at an unsecured residence where Hunter was renting...
Crypt1cDOTA,Wouldn't it be nice if Congress could spend time writing legislation rather than investigations 100% of the time?
FalcorFliesMePlaces,"In for nailing all politician for any laws broken.  They should be all held accountable table including Trump.  However lots of money has been spent going after Trump and nothing sticks.  So to me it seems he played the game well, he is slimy.  I think we should continue to go after him as he was a sitting president.

I think hunter Biden needs to be looked at for maybe tax evasion but I don't think he broke the law.  Hunter is a scumbag and I mean he won't even talk to his daughter snd won't let her have his name.

President Biden is a bit of a cruddy grandpa for not acknowledging his granddaughter.  I do not believe he did anything wrong.  However I do think he needs a cognitive test like democrats made Trump do.  But I think it should be a yearly standard for all people to do.  And finally obv I am concerned about him having classified secrets and this needs to be investigates.  As he is thebpresident I may consider this more important. 

Let me be clear I think Biden had these documents by mistake but it could be a big mistake.  I think Trump had them for nefarious reasons."
smackmedown,Wow. So much hate- so little convictions for anything. Trump has my vote if he makes it on the ticket. Just sayin….
spanky90210,Another bogus witch hunt.
Anarchris427,"Fair enough, investigate away. And while you’re at it try investigating every sweetheart deal landed by Obama, Biden, Bush, the Clintons, Gore, etc. after they left office. Start with comparing net worth before and 5 years after their terms."
