Papaofmonsters,This picture smells like lilac and gooseberries.
WickedSlice_,She looks like she is about to give a prostate exam üòÇ
novacdk,"Nice try, Olivia Wilde! I see you!"
petite-cherie_,"As someone who used to do photo editing, you might want to ease up on the face editing, especially under the eyes. Less is more, and you want to go real easy on certain parts if you don't want it to look over worked"
Zettomer,"IDK, it doesn't look right. One user mentioned the use of a face filter and perhaps that is. But there's something very cgi esque. Maybe the photo had a touch up in something like photoshop or extensive make up, but this photo seems extremely unnatural. My money is significantly editted in photoshop, the shadows in particular seem artificially enhanced..

That or full cgi. The whole thing looks unreal. IF it is real, consider this a compliment I suppose"
Icy_Level_6434,Be nice to see without photoshop
ClankyBat246,"This looks a lot closer to good cgi than it does irl...

So that's a win I guess."
GamersLaboratory,Yennefer was my favourite character in the Witcher 3 . . . . image looks like it resembles a wax model version of the character
SomethingPersonnel,This looks like it was rendered in UE5.
ThatFeel_IKnowIt,RIP this subreddit.
the_dudeNI,Face filter makes you look like a sex doll.
atlrabbit,Cgi
BigandBlackk,Look better than the Netflix adaptation of her 10/10
Punk_Says_Fuck_You,"Hot girl post cosplay to gaming: Reddit-awesome job!

Not hot girl post cosplay to gaming: Reddit-stop posting cosplays in a gaming sub."
AdamNRG,"""cosplay"" is starting to get an extremely loose term nowadays..."
box_me_up,Either your skin is amazing or heavily edited. I cannot tell though so nice work!
Melan420,I'm getting uncanny valley feeling from this
FearTheReaper73,Cosplay and Photoshop should not coexist in a same sentence. However‚Ä¶
BlueInfinity2021,"Extremely well done.

If someone had posted this as a leaked screenshot from The Witcher 4 I would have believed it."
TheRealJayk0b,"Lol, at first I thought it's a Render, but that's meant positively."
NayMarine,You could also pull off any Olivia Wilde cosplay you wanted like that character from Tron.
tvirustodd,Looks like CGI
retrorays,nice CGI
beardingmesoftly,"Turn the light down, wear less makeup"
lepercake,Holy shit you actually look a bit like a 3D render this is tite
TheNegaHero,"Looks amazing! Scrolling down my Reddit feed and thought ""oh wow, are they putting Olivia Wilde in the Witcher?"""
AlwaysUseAFake,"Nice costume.  

Is your hand really small? Or is it a camera trick..?"
Tasty01,Your eyes look off and so does your hairline. Also looks like your face has been cut from a different photo and pasted on this one. The longer I look the weirder the picture gets. Your right arm als looks copy pasted from a different photo and you have a really small hand.
dougiefresh236,Alot of airbrush/editing but cool
Adeep187,No
darkwombat45,Its quite good because at least it looks like her. That actress on the Netflix series was a brutal choice.
Lyceus_,Great cosplay!
matTmin45,What Netflix character should have looked like.
McWeaksauce91,I thought this was a picture from the game
lumiranswife,"I've read but not watched the shows, this was my mental depiction. Nice cos, OP!"
Jericho_Initiative,Still looks better than netflix.
CremasterReflex,The drastic contrast in focus between you and the background (whether from focus length or green screen) and the rest of the postproduction really sells the video game character look. Good job!
rdldr1,Better than the Netflix Show.
DesignerFox2987,way way better than netflix yenn
Atomsteel,"10/10 tasteful cosplay

Your others are great too."
kinemator,#teamtriss
RastaImp0sta,"Take my hand!

No, ugh, give me your other hand!

I can‚Äôt, this is my strong hand!"
guilen,"Ignore the reddit twats. You've nailed the look from the game, fantastic work!"
thaneros2,Nice! Looks like you could pull off a great Baroness from G.I Joe
JP_GamingOnline,Gorgeous indeed
Slash_Raptor92,Are those your real eyes or contacts? They're very pretty.
Dcor,Netflix should have cast you.
lan60000,Looks like Sasha grey
Majestic_Preparation,It looks very nice. should have shared full outfit.
,[removed]
sashinexists,Are you sure this isn't a screenshot from the Witcher 4?
temetnoscesax,Incredible!!
EmEmPeriwinkle,Looks great to me! Can I ask where you got your contacts?
WCGWjoiningReddit,"Hooooly SHIT, look just like her!"
,I refuse to believe this is a real image.
camlo316,Uncanny valley
Korimthos,"At first glance, it looks like a Madam Tussauds statue"
TomasdeVasconcellos,Too much photoshop
istandabove,Better than Netflix yen.
Virtual-Appeal-8504,This is even better than the casting done for the Netflix show. You make a wayyyy better Yen!
steeze206,"I swear the only things I ever see from this sub that hit front page are attractive women cosplaying something and people self promoting the games they are developing with some fake sob story behind it. 

Unless I actively seek out this sub, the only thing I see that comes from it is someone promoting themselves. Just nonstop ads to wishlist something on Steam or follow someone on Instagram. Do you guys never get tired of this stuff? You guys don't actually care about how accurate the costume is. If the woman wasn't hot literally nobody would care about this post lmao. It's gotten to the point where posts like this easily surpass actual discussion about gaming each and every time. Unique game clips, of really anything much more directly linked to gaming. 

This sub has some good stuff. It's hard to find though because soooo many horny Redditors upvote any decent looking woman with a DSLR and a costume to the moon lmao."
kehmesis,Wow. Absolutely stunning. üòç
peedi1603,Should have casted you for the Netflix show
Metalomeus,Looks neat.... But I don't understand the need to to show themselves like this... Maybe I'm too old for this ....
Zalar01,"Personally I would love to see more of the cosplay instead of a mugshot, but whatever."
-wtfisthat-,Looks better than the girl who plays her in the show lol
KingCrow27,Foreheads too large and cheekbones protrude too much.
RudegarWithFunnyHat,wonder how lilac and gooseberries really smell
moldawgs,Love the cosplay but maybe it‚Äôs just me that thinks the hand seems like out of place/doesn‚Äôt match the rest of the photo due to the editing - don‚Äôt get me wrong the editing is amazing just the hand throws me off üôà
Raph2051,Wow
rastagizmo,Wanna come over to my place and see my expertly stuffed unicorn?

dehblackbeltah,Hmmmm... *Nodding approvingly*
jholden0,I am so confused right now.  Is this a real person?
Sigg3net,Why did you pose next to a drowning Hitman?
shocksalot123,The sheer amount of editing/filtering on the face tho....
MagsNfragS,"Fair skin, Raven hair. I'm only hoping you smell of lilac and gooseberries."
Mirthyhux,Where were you when Netflix was casting for the show

MotorVariation8,"Resting bitch face makes me truly appreciate this, probably my favourite cosplay of Yen ever."
