picado,"""But in my defense I'm profoundly stupid and gullible."""
AggravatingHorror757,Ultra MAGAs have tossed her aside. She needs to try to cultivate the less insane wingnuts to maintain her viability
thistimelineisweird,"""I only said what I said to get elected, and now that I got elected I do not believe what I said, but I'll say it again if you're still stupid and want me to say it come the next election."" - Republicans everywhere."
Knoblord_McCheese,"Ladies and Gentleman of the jury, I'm just a Caveman. I fell in some ice and later got thawed out by your scientists. Your world frightens and confuses me. Sometimes the honking horns of your traffic make me want to get out of my BMW and run off into the hills or whatever. Sometimes when I get a message on my fax machine, did little demons get inside and type it? I don't know. My primitive mind can't grasp these concepts."
Disco_Dreamz,So I guess she admits that she’s a gullible conspiracist dumbass who has no place being anywhere near the levers of power
thepartypantser,Does that mean there are no Jewish space lasers?
M-V-P623,"Sounds like she hired a PR manager. The amount of times she’s doubled down on insane, I highly doubt she’s suddenly been struck sane."
piles_of_anger,Unforgivable. To have the capacity to be hoodwinked by such conspiratorial bullshit is proof she doesn't have the mental fortitude to hold office.
,"No

No

Fuck off

You **do not** get to just “oopsie poopsie!” that away like it was some fad.

You supported a coup attempt, not rocked frosted tips"
TurbulentSomewhere64,Like she tripped and fell into the shit? And didn’t double down on it repeatedly?
,[deleted]
letters2nora,She is full of shit and should not be let off the hook or validated. She’s a conspiracy theorist and a racist.
brainwhatwhat,"""hahaha I saw some funny memes and became a traitor but now I'm chilling out. Forgive? K thx."""
10390,That makes her a follower not a leader.
BigNickDipples,I dunno guys. Sounds to me like she's been paid a visit by the Gaspacho.
maxthepupp,"I'm so fucking sick of these traitors, insurrectionists, and general scumbags *keep* getting away with saying and doing whatever the fuck with total impunity.

wheels of justice move slow...blah,blah,blah..

This whole shitshow is gearing up again only this time it won't be a dry run.

Arrest. Trump. Now. And his cadre of Kompromats.

While we still can.

I swear to God watching absolutely nothing outwardly being done except the same old outrage is worse than Nazis trying to overthrow the Govt.

Stop. Them. Now."
Richard_Sauce,"She's moving up the ladder and it is beneficial to her career aspirations to at least appear to be less batshit crazy. She's still the same alt-right troll she's always been, but she's going to attempt to have better public relations moving forward. We'll just have to see she has the discipline to do so."
Camel_Natural,Insert eye roll here.
zaxdaman,"To be fair, haven’t we all at one time believed that Jews are changing the climate with lasers in space? It’s an easy mistake to make."
theindependentonline,"Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has more than most to celebrate as the new GOP majority takes power in the House of Representatives, and is doing all she can to engineer a Capitol Hill comeback as a result.

The Georgia congresswoman is set to be assigned committee memberships alongside her other Republican and Democratic colleagues in the days ahead, the end to a punishment handed down just a month after she joined the chamber.

[Read the full story](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-disavow-b2258260.html)"
smcmahon710,"Politicians like her are gonna walk back all their takes and even supporting Trump. It's all a game, it's all bullshit"
ubzrvnT,"I fucking knew it! I could tell she was backing away from her bullshit. She’s been siding with the more distinguished traitors like McCarthy who know how to wield their power and make themselves NOT look crazy on the surface. She’s coaching that new crazy mf’er Santos. He’s full batshit so that we ALL talk about him and make sure his branding sticks. Then, he’ll just make himself seem apart of the “normal” establishment. These fascists have influenced and infiltrated our government successfully and this will only get worse."
vinsite,AKA. I'm too stupid to know the difference between reality and Internet memes.
TintedApostle,What a load of junk.  If she did then she should resign.
Isredel,"Bullshit.  _She knew._

She catered to Trump’s base as means to both grift and get a modicum of power.  And now that she and the rest of the seditionists got what they wanted, she wants to appear reasonable.

Fuck her."
FortySixAndYou,"Someone has been whispering in her ear and has her believing she can be a Senator.    She probably has too much batshit baggage at this point, but Georgia nearly elected Walker, who knows?"
torontosparky,"Remember when she had herself filmed stalking AOC to her office, yelling like an idiot outside of her door?  So that is someone else's fault, huh."
colocasi4,"Breaking news.....uneducated MTG gets all her information from the internet, and hasn't got the brain cells to decide what's true/false. LOL"
kryptonianCodeMonkey,"Don't get me wrong. This is, technically speaking, ""progress"". The problem is that my perspective on her intelligence, kindness, and the amount of respect she deserves is so low, she could spend the next 30 years making progress before I would even allow her to pick my clothes out. Yet because of some county full of backwards Georgian asshats that live for the hate and conspiratorial nonsense she spews, she gets to legislate laws and set budgets for the entire fucking country. Jesus fucking Christ. Someone needs to get her dumbass out of Congress at the earliest possible moment, not give her committee assignments. That woman is vile."
kmurph72,Which only happens to stupid people.
combustioncat,She is so grooming herself to be Trump’s VP pick right now.
nomorerainpls,It’s gonna take more than that to explain Jewish space lasers and gazpacho police
brasht,So either she was an idiot who got sucked in to random shit found on the internet or she tried to play to the conspiracy nutters and get their backing and the found out that those people are the minority and not worth it. Either way she is thicker than cold custard and nowhere near an palatable.
milkonyourmustache,"Her admission of being gullible is a cop out. She knows exactly what she was doing - preying on peoples fear, ignorance, and anxiety about the general state of the country, the economy, their lives, and how everything is getting worse with near absolute certainty every single year for everyone who is not already rich and/or well connected."
Halfwise2,"Part of the deal with McCarthy?

""Drop the QAnon shit and vote for me, and I'll do... """
MandoBandano,"A person with extremely poor judgment says they have poor judgment, but keeps 6 figured job anyways."
Lastnamewaffles,No. Fuck this. You can’t pull out of crazy now that it doesn’t help you. She needs to go down with this ship.
lt1brunt,"Bull $Hite she is a hard core racist, idiot, insurrection loving leather face who is only reading from a script to help cleanup her image. By next friday she will be back on the hunter Biden's non important laptop and investigating Biden for existing."
huskers37,I don't think you should hold a place in power of you're media illiterate
Gentleman_Villain,"But wait, hear me out: Fuck her, regardless of this statement. 

She's not going to repent. She's just covering her ass."
simmons777,So she still has the same beliefs but doesn't want to attribute them to qanon?
smokegrasseatass69,Some people buy a convertible when they’re having a mid-life crisis other people try to overthrow governments
doucheydp,She's realized the Q crowd turned on her for supporting McCarthy and is pivoting to try to salvage relevance and a career path forward to the next election.  That's all this nonsense is from her... she's an opportunist.
Imanerd69,"“Oops! Im sorry I fall for random bullshit I find on the internet, my bad!”"
Nosmurfz,She just sucks
SunMoonTruth,"So she’s trying to make herself palatable to the wider base as a running mate for 2024.

And those fucken suckers will lap it up because appearance is all that matters to those jerks."
aka_r4mses,I’ll clean that up for her.  “Spreading bat shit crazy conspiracy theories isn’t going to be as beneficial to me anymore so I will be leaning towards alternatives that better benefit myself.”
getsangryatsnails,"If she can be sucked into something as rediculous as that, how easy would it be for her to be manipulated via other channels?"
risingblue,"My God, she's as dumb as a box of rocks."
Hoobs88,“It served its purpose” -MTG /s
Bland_Uninteresting,What a genuinely terrible fucking person
riblet_flip,I wish she’d get sucked into a wood chipper
Mediocre_Bit_405, Criminal stupidity is not a defense.
Count_Bacon,Anyone who fell for Quanon is not fit to be in congress imo
Smackatoo,Why the fuck would you vote for someone so easily led!?
Codilla660,We don’t need politicians who form their beliefs on “what I saw on the internet”.
Top-Geologist-9213,"Just what this country needs. Someone in charge of representing others who get ""sucked into stuff they read on the Internet"". A real intellectual."
fdolce,"She should be looked at by the House Oversight Committee, not on it."
General_Tso75,So we should trust her judgment now after she admitted to being an idiot?
Caninetrainer,"Funny how she says this now, when her own voters are telling her to turn the rhetoric down. Her manipulative, self serving, hypocritical ways  are an embarrassment to women."
Electrical-News-9233,How about believing school shooting survivors Is she going to stop harassing them? Apologise for the pain and hurt inflicted on those families?
saltwaterterrapin,"That’s what you say after a weekend-long TVTropes binge, not years of endorsing bigotry and fascism."
joecool42069,Bullshit... she's trying to pivot to being more 'moderate' or sane. Probably to run with Trump. That's why she's holding back the crazy.
Trygolds,The GOP are pulling the curtain back in place.
UsualAnybody1807,"Too bad there isn't a bot that displays the video of Greene closely following/harassing David Hogg, a student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, in Parkland, Florida, which had 14 students and 3 staff killed by a gunman. 

Video is midway down the page at this [link](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10280273/marjorie-taylor-greene-david-hogg-parkland-harassment-video)."
Geeber_The_Drooler,"So she got the ""stop"" order too. Just like bozobert. Interesting. 

Who gave them the stop order.?"
R1chard69,"I would find this far more believable if she'd said ; ""I've sucked on some things I'd seen on the internet."""
riko77can,"I'm getting tired of the folks who won't believe anything on a major news outlet but will parrot any batshit crazy fringe narrative that isn't even internally consistent.  That's what they call ""real news""."
illusive_guy,"Is this where she has an epiphany and realizes she made big mistakes and changes herself to become a better person and do her job properly, justly, and rationally?"
briareus08,"“I’m a serious person now, and you should take me seriously”"
AnonAlcoholic,"People who get ""sucked into things on the internet"" should not be elected to public office."
defaultusername-17,"She still believes all the same shit, she's a liar.

She just knows that people don't like nazis, and she's hoping to fit that mask back on."
lew_rong,asdfasdf
chupathingy99,You don't come back from gazpacho and space lasers.
troublinparadise,"Entire country: NO SHIT, SHERLOCK"
MelkorWasRight,lmao no. you don’t get to wash that stink off that easily
PMmeurdixout4harambe,"Too late, damage has been done. Especially for the Sandy hook victims families"
wahmpire,"Controversial statement here... but without giving her too much credit; good for... the people that follow her.  They need an example of someone in their circle coming to the conclusion that ""not everything on the Internet is true"""
pygmymetal,Uh huh. Not buying it.
TimothyBukinowski,"She sucks but this is progress. Is it politically motivated? Probably, but we need to move the conversation back closer to reality and if MTG is willing to sort of do that, I'll take it."
surgeons_mate,Well all of a sudden somebody wants to be in the leadership of the conference.
barnabyjones420,"This is probably a hot take for reddit, but we need to be able to give people a path out of radicalism."
,".... Is that supposed to make us feel some relief? ""dont worry guys, I'm just so dumb that I unquestionably trusted random mentally deranged people online. I realize that now"" yeah OK"
eyefaerie,How fucking convenient
Nimulous,"Just like Trump who for several years insisted Obama wasn’t a U.S. citizen, then, just like that - poof - “Of course he is, and I’m running for President”

These people make me sick."
JL671,"If you believe in dumbass conspiracies on the internet, maybe you shouldn't be in congress and resign?"
spacecadet84,"That's what she said when she was sworn in, but she was still pushing this garbage privately to Trump around the time of the insurrection.

I don't believe her, she's just saying whatever she thinks she has to in order to avoid scrutiny."
MountaineerHikes,Tryin to look legitimate now that they have the majority…#neverforget #jewspacelasers #peachtreedish
L0rd_OverKill,"“I accosted Sandy Hook survivors in the street, and set my tribe of MAGA idiots on them, but it’s not my fault. It’s not my responsibility to fact check things.”"
DeadheadSteve95,Did she just admit to being stupid and gullible?
d4rkskies,"TLDR: Fruitloop admits she completely believed in Fruitloop things, pushed by fellow Fruitloops, now tiny mind is completely focused on other Fruitloop things… Which are still connected to the previous Fruitloopery…"
lewd_loser_inc,“So far in the past”? It wasn’t very long ago this moron was on camera talking about eating meat grown in Bill Gates “peach tree dish” because the government doesn’t want it’s people eating real cheeseburgers..

Tdk456,Why is she still allowed to work in government. Sheesh
banned_bc_dumb,"Ladies & Gentlemen of Georgia, your representative."
Jaynie2019,So she fell into the rabbit hole and is walking it back. Whatever. I’d rather see her have a 1:1 on camera apologizing for being an asshole to David Hogg.
MechanicAfraid9468,She’s lying. This is simply to make giving her committee assignments palatable to leadership. She’s still as batshit crazy as she ever was.
zootsuitbeatnick,Doesn't make her any less morally and ethically bankrupt.
goforthandconquer,"People please try to understand. This woman is a liar.

I know people just like her that live in Georgia and they have just toned it down, but they still believe like the first day they swallowed the story. 

She is a liar, just like Trump"
Olderscout77,Total BS. MTG is devoted to the nonsense of QAnon because that's her base.

tacotimes01,"Oh cool, she is mentally stable and reliably intelligent now, great!  No need to worry about the next cult or conspiracy."
hitman2218,Is MTG evolving before our very eyes? Will she seem downright rational by 2024?
iEugene72,"She 100% is not backing away, she's just saying that so that donors don't feel so weary around her. I'd bet my bottom dollar that she still believes nearly everything they say.

Remember, this is a woman who can't go 30 minutes without calling everyone a pedophile."

Jesus Christ. She is passing the buck."

vagabondvisions,Does she actually think she has a future in the mainstream of this country’s politics???  Is she trying to pivot as an audition for Trump’s running mate?
PhysicalPolicy6227,Pope George Santos must have helped her see the error of her way
Lott4984,She is now best buds with McCarthy and he probably informed her she needs to reform her image.

Apprehensive-Donkey7,Fuck off Marge.
zenithfury,"And then continued to spew said internet things into politics for years, but now that she’s learned her lesson everything is forgiven. 

Not."
Redditfront2back,"She’s trying to rebrand, be little miss inside the beltway."
Danielkerscher,Don’t believe anything she says. Some will say anything and do anything to get what they want. MTG is pure evil.
IGargleGarlic,"Ah, yes! Just the quality we look for in our elected officials - easily swayed by internet conspiracy theorists! The fact that she is still even allowed to hold office after all this is baffling to me."
deloreanipsum,Sounds like she’s trying to clear the way for a VP nom.
mrbigglessworth,Bullshit.  She no longer wants the association because it’s not longer politically convenient
Beachhaze,"Don’t be fooled, she’s trying to rebrand her image based on the deals she made with McCarthy for her vote for him as speaker."
true-skeptic,"Too bad everything she said is captured on video and burned into our brains. Not buying it, Marj, you insurrectionist traitor. Hopefully under investigation."
throwy_6,Don’t let her back away from it. Shove it in her face every chance you get. This piece of human trash doesn’t get to just walk away
JojenCopyPaste,And how do we know you won't get sucked in again? And why wouldn't you admit that during the election?
DimesSuperFan,That's a lot to take back.  How is any reasonable person expected to to regard her with any sense of credibility?
saltyfingas,"I mean on one hand, I can commend her for realizing she was a fool, on the other, she should not be in congress because she is capable of being that big of a fool"
MintJulepTestosteron,If you’re sucked in by something so obviously bullshit you have no business being in a leadership position.
Classic_Blueberry973,So she admits she is a moron not worthy of holding public office.  This is the first time I have agreed with her on something.
stonewall386,“I really displayed the fact that I’m not fit for any leadership role…”
bachleder,"Psychosis is a hell of thing. It makes ya wonder how many crazy people there are out there with the same insane thoughts let alone who actually talk about that shit out loud, run for office, but somehow miraculously get elected into public office as high up as a member of the House of Representatives.

IMO, America had lead in the gasoline for far too long and now we’re seeing the stupid float to the surface faster than than the bubbles the Fed Reserve is watching as the rest of world suffers with these rate hikes + QT.

I can’t underscore how vastly superior everything would become if the human race demanded its politicians focus on improving,

1. Air
2. Water
3. Food
4. Infrastructures 
5. Education 
6. Healthcare

Everything else just seems largely irrelevant, minuscule, and circumstantial.

We don’t need morons thinking Jews have space lasers starting forest fires in California from our politicians. We need adults. Always have and always will."
_ChrisFromTexas,"Can you imagine if she actually took this as a learning moment and legislated for more fact-checking and regulation of supposed “news” organizations? She won’t, but can you imagine?"
Butterball_Adderley,"She got sucked into a time machine. She was sent here from the Paleolithic

Edit: not because she’s ignorant, but because she looks like a caveman"
coldphront3,"Right... because ""I got fooled by internet conspiracy theories"" is what you want to hear from an elected member of the United States House of Representatives."
SuperRocketRumble,This is calculated. She wants people to take her seriously.
esotericenema,"Oh, sweetheart, no one ever thought you actually believed any of that sh-t.  Everyone knows you're just an evil cheating Nazi b-tch just pretending to believe that shit to take advantage of actually gullible, devout, and sincere, but stupid people.  And you tried to blow people up.  The whole trying to murder people part is kind of the more important part."
United-Cockroach-980,Majorie ‘pipe bombs’ Greene should be locked  up.
2OneZebra,If the DOJ overlooks this trolls actions on January 6th then there is no justice. She knows what they have and now she is trying to switch gears.
Reckless_Pixel,"Moonwalk all you want Marge, it’s not gonna make you look any better."
PowerAlwaysReveals,"A pleasant surprise, then?

This reminds me a little bit of that time in November 2016 when then President-*elect* Donald Trump came to the White House at the invitation of then-President Barack Obama to start making arrangements for the transition process. Whatever one thinks of the man or his politics, Obama has proven on numerous occasions over the years that he can conduct himself with perfect civility and professionalism whenever the situation demands it. 

Accordingly, Trump had no reason to expect that Obama would treat him with any less consideration…and yet he clearly was.

Following their private meeting, Obama invited Trump to sit with him in the Oval Office, where a large group of news photographers rotated in and out to capture the two of them on camera, and a smaller group of reporters tried to get in a few questions. 

Obama’s responses tended to focus on the subject matter discussed in the meeting, plus underscoring his commitment to being every bit as good to the incoming president as George W. Bush had been to him eight years earlier.

Trump, on the other hand, seemed to truly marvel at the fact that Obama was capable of carrying on a ‘normal’ conversation with him. Surprised that he actually wasn’t the weird, over-the-top cartoon villain caricature he had built up in his own mind, and in the minds of others."
Reditate,If you can't perform basic critical thinking in determining what's real and what isn't on the internet then you don't need to be making laws for the country.
Assfuck-McGriddle,Didn’t she already make a fake apology over this shit literally a year into politics? She’s only gotten worse since.
GreatGonz98,Bet you thats not all she sucks
Comfortable-Pick-375,A lot of people get sucked into things on the internet without pushing a dangerous message that has gotten people killed.
gravy_train101,Press x to doubt
cashrchek,... uh huh.
Sigma_Function-1823,"Ignore what she says , as per usual it's a lie meant too remove herself from any accountability.

 The reason she's is trying too suddenly appear legit is because she weaseled McCarthy into giving her real power by placing her in a committee assignment that would have formerly gone too a supposed old school republican.

And with that trump is back in charge of the party... Idiot republicans tried too dump trump too late.

Any day now expect fox too get back on the trump train."
This_Egg_348,"She’s saying I want to be on all the choice committees that can persecute the FBI, Fauci, and the January 6th committee."

High_Pains_of_WTX,"Ohhhh, someone wants to do POLITICS now, huh?"
aStoveAbove,"So she's saying she's not hateful, she's just really, really, really fucking stupid?  

She's either got the IQ of room temperature in the Arctic during a blizzard, or she's a hateful piece of shit. I'd argue both, but the fact she thinks she can play off all this shit as ""I just got sucked into some stuff online"" isn't the absolution she thinks it is lmfao"
fenris71,"Everybody say it with me….Jewish space lasers. 
Gullible is not the word"
