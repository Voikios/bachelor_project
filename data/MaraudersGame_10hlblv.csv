lifeisagameweplay,"You could just turn off voip and ""kill or be killed"" even if the game had it. Games like this are all about choosing your playstyle. You shouldn't be happy about a lack of options even if you don't want it."
wizardjian,"I'd like to have it just in case thou. Like, I play both Hunt and Tarkov which both have prox chat, and while I still basically don't touch them, it is nice once in a while to just talk and negotiate or just shout at one another lol. At least in my opinion, the moments voip created, friends or enemies or betrayals, is much more memorable than shift W and click on heads."
ClaytonBigsby2020,"I think your onto something with the ""*you should have the option to*"" line. 

The thing about including something like proximity chat is, it's 100% optional. For some reason, I doubt the inclusion of proximity chat would make this game any less sweaty. 

I always see posts on this subreddit addressed to various anonymous players: ""*To the marauder who \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ at the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I can't believe \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ happened""*

Or this one about Jeff for instance: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/10h1i0n/never\_met\_someone\_like\_jeff\_in\_this\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/10h1i0n/never_met_someone_like_jeff_in_this_game/)

People clearly want to connect, they should have a way to do so. Global voice is the obvious solution. 

And hey, who's to say you couldn't've breached Jeff and Demonic Mango, voice chat disabled, and took their pistol totin' asses out with the L1A1?

I think Marauders can make room for both kinds of players to do their thing. Folks like yourself who wanna click heads no funny business, and then guys who wanna clown around like in the video you see above."
decurser,"Agreed. I got F1, and the only other one I want is my F2 to say ‚ÄúNo, fuck you!‚Äù"
Blue_Eyed_Brick,"It's shit, just add it already"
ma_wee_wee_go,Salty Ur bad at mind games
anon36969,Yeah kinda ruined tarkov for me I like the non verbal gamble you take interacting with randos
ImmaDaBes,I hope the devs keep it this way. No need to be quiet or negotiate with ppl.
Noming_Babies,"Dude I‚Äôm right there with you. I‚Äôm a damn space pirate, I don‚Äôt care if your ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù give me your shit lol."
JRed_Deathmatch,"Devs listening to low IQ takes like this is why the game will never grow to it's fullest potential.

If proxy chat disturbs you so much, just turn it off? Jesus, not that hard really. If you didn't think of that yourself you have an actual IQ issue."
AnaSimulacrum,I hate VoIP in tarkov. I've had it on for less than 10minutes across 2 interactions. First time I got to hear children spam N words till I laid in a bush and turned it off. Second time someone was playing music through microphone. No thanks.
Shoresy69420,The fact that I can‚Äôt play Fortunate Son while jackhammering fools is a crime give me voip
some_random_nonsense,"Not me mashing ""hold fire"" ""help"" at every person I see when I dont have a kill marauders mission...."
aidanhsmith,"Nah I mean if you‚Äôve ever played Tarkov you should know damn well voice chat is not saving you lol. I just wish the f1-f8 were actually useful. Give me a yes and a no, instead I get fuck you!, ATTACK, and hold fire which isn‚Äôt very conversational."
Sors_Numine,"> I don‚Äôt want to feel bad for ‚Äúmurdering‚Äù someone trying to plead for mercy.

Then embrace your sins coward"
One-Philosopher8711,"it's another reason why this game has low player count, voip makes so much more content possible"
Smokedsoba,I love all the threads about this. Its as if you cant turn it off. So many people with spaghetti falling out their pocket with just the thought of having to converse with someone.
nervouswhenitseasy,how do i downvote twice?
CodaxTheVulture,"i love voip in tarkov and hunt showdown - i can scare the enemy once i flank them   
 I can sometimes reason with solo players that do not wish to die too   
It makes interactions way more fun + killing gets more immersive"
BankOnTheDank,You could just turn off proximity chat if they add it.
Critical_Quick,My all time worst experience with prox chat in a video game is in warzone 2. Bunch of Mexican guys cornered me and demanded I dropped all my cash or they would kill me. üòî
Pleasant_Issue,Prox chat is great - it gets used a ton for the first few weeks then people sort of go silent if they want to kill you. Can have a clear conscious if you don‚Äôt yell friendly and then kill them after
