{"Title": "Pre FIR tarkov was tarkovs peak. Change my mind.", "Post Text": "Pre FIR was tarkovs peak, you could play the game how you wanted and everyone could be on a similar playing field as you could buy your way through quests, buy almost anything off the flee, (perfect for late comers that get into the game towards mid-late wipe) if you grinded the cash and being able to sell items that you had stashed in your container. \n\nGeneral Sam said it best, with FIR, everyone that finds a expensive item or quest item will just avoid fights and try to extract as fast as possible. But when you knew you had enough stuff to pay back the  majority of your loadout or had some quest item that you could hand in regardless of death. You would push fights more and actually enjoy the aspect of what makes tarkov amazing.\n\nNow, it's basically rolling a slot machine that rolls three more slot machines, as RNG and luck is the main outcome of raid these days. Regardless of skill.\n\nYes, it had its janky netcode and performance issues, and its cheaters. But that.... Hasn't got better since. So not really a valid argument.\n\nThe only thing that I would include from \"new tarkov\" is the high end gear on flee being removed, as it made questing and Leveling pointless. Besides the removal of certain guns and certain ammo.\n\nEdit: jesus this blew up. I'm gonna add some other things that I have missed and read. \n\nSo, hatchlings, pistolings and whateverlings. Whilst yes were a problem back then. Can still be done today with the use of the Double Barrel shotgun and a bag, as it negates the Tagged and Cursed system and costs very very little. That almost anything you can slot in your rectum will pay for it.\n\nInteria is the other thing, and to be fair. Whilst it was incredibly fun to have a more arcade like movement system, I do agree that inertia is something that made the game better.\n\nAnd for those who think that I'm saying that newer tarkov is bad, no. It has its... Many problems, yes. The game has evolved since and feels more towards its final goal, somewhat. \n\nIt's just that Pre FiR and further back, was the best this game was.", "ID": "106pi3o", "Score": 1969, "Total Comments": 909, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/106pi3o/pre_fir_tarkov_was_tarkovs_peak_change_my_mind/"}
