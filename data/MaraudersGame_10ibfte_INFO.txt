{"Title": "Marauders is SO MUCH more fun than Tarkov", "Post Text": "I've played tarkov since March 2022 and just started playing Marauders today, and I have had so much more fun playing Marauders than I ever had playing Tarkov and so have my friends.\n\n\nRecently this Tarkov wipe really has ruined the game for me and my friends because of the new map being glitchy, the audio is horrible, the insane amount of hackers and people getting banned for killing twitch streamers and just a bunch of horrible stuff ruining the game.\n\n\nI liked tarkov, but the developers for that game were abusing their power (they can literally ban you without plausible cause, in their TOS, it is stated they must not provide evidence or reason regaurding an account ban) and were ruining the game with game breaking updates and changes. I've seen nothing but complaints from the tarkov subreddit. \n\n\nIf Team17 (which is a company I've always liked for games like Worms and The eacapists) can update their game regularly, listen to the community, fix bugs/glitches and add content consistently then I think this game can become something really big in the next few years and easily surpass Tarkov.\n\n\nBasically, what im saying is Marauders > Escape From Tarkov", "ID": "10ibfte", "Score": 76, "Total Comments": 63, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/10ibfte/marauders_is_so_much_more_fun_than_tarkov/"}
