I think the OP's New Build Style for 2023 is very nice. For those interested view [Changes Made In Fluxo's World - Color Scheme](https://youtu.be/LFSYLj0k0eE?t=37) (Video Bookmark - Previous Video) - Gone is the Tan / Blue color scheme from 2022, and the introduction of a Tan / Brown 3-Color Scheme for 2023. 

I often encourage others to view the OPs other Factory Showcases and for those whom missed them be sure to check out the [OPs YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CrusadeFluxo/videos).

‚ûî WHAT IS IN THIS VIDEO (Bookmarks):

* [Intro](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=15) - Opening comments by the OP, and initial views of this Awesome Build.

* [Main Entrance and Vehicle Parking](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=50) - The ""imperfect"" Roadway Wall Railing on the left is an interesting ""design"", and emphasizes that not everything needs to be perfect to look good.

* [HQ Train Station](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=80) - This area is used to bring in Munitions Factory needed materials and resources.

* [HQ Main Platform](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=97) - This grand open area utilizing the large water fall as a ""design element"" is a great idea. ‚òÖ *NOTE: All Waterfalls are ""placeholders"" and will change with the eventual new look of Water* [*as previewed in this Devlog*](https://youtu.be/omjFqZQV9fI?t=83) *(Video Bookmark) when it is finally released Map-wide.*

* [HQ Munitions Factory Production](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=121) - Look at Heavy Oil Residue (HOR), Black Powder, Smokeless Powder, Rifle Ammo and Nobelisk Production Lines. I loved the inclusion of Spire Coast Biome Landscape into the overall design.

* [HQ Munition Center](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=172) - The Munition Center next to where the HUB will be is a great idea. Really liked the ""Overlook Window Design"" giving a great view of the rest of the Build in this World.

* [Encased HUB and Trophy Room](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=203) - The idea of ""encasing"" the HUB in Coated Concrete is very nice and highly ""steal-able"". The Trophy's in the Trophy Room were properly placed and not dropped as an ""item"".

* [Outro and Final Beauty Fly-Thru's](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=237) - Final comments by the OP and some more lovely shots of this fantastic Build.

‚òÖ This Post is worthy of my Upvote and Award.

*EDIT: Corrected Trophy Room comment to reflect comment by OP.*
