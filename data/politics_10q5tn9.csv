rosebudlightsaber,I believe‚Ä¶ who was it? Was it Trump? Who was it that said they think people who plead the fifth are always guilty?
Da_Vader,"""It is so unfair that they caught me. Many many others, even more horrible are not even investigated. They only go after your favorite president - me."""
Unshkblefaith,"Amusingly, pleading the fifth doesn't help him in this civil case. In civil cases  pleading the fifth can be used as a sign of guilt. Sure it temporarily prevents him from criminal charges. It still hurts his case in the civil proceeding."
Trashman56,"You see them, they plead the fifth, it's like the mob."
numbermess,"""Only the mob takes the fifth! Except for me!""

<thunderous applause>"
Buffmin,"Conservatives this is your guy. This is the man you picked and is the face of your party. 

A liar and grifter who is too much of a baby to stand up for himself. Hilary was able to testify for like 10 hours without pleading the 5th...  She has more of a spine than your God 

Good job idiots"
laythor,Luckily his fan base watches zero programs that would report on this in an unbiased way.
abandonedwnc,Well this drinking game turned out insane
bunkscudda,"> ‚ÄúYou see the mob takes the Fifth. If you‚Äôre innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?‚Äù

Donald Trump"
Spring___spring69,"Someone should do a loop of the video of him saying only criminals plead the fifth, then clip of him pleading the fifth, then his video saying criminals do it, then his next 5th plea and again and again"
din7,"""One two three fo FIF"""
Jacksquat102,Put him in jail already
Regulus0,"*He added: ‚ÄúThis whole thing is very unfair.‚Äù*

Of course it is unfair, you broke the law that the rest of the citizens in this country need to abide by. That is very  unfair. You're right. That's why this is happening to you."
Golluk,"You'd think after being in politics, he'd learned to use the phrase ""I don't recall"" instead. But then maybe that's admitting weakness in memory."
alleyoopoop,"Only the best people plead the fifth.

sirZofSwagger,Who was it that said they only plead the 5th if they are guilty?
Shirowoh,‚ÄúOnly criminals plead the fifth‚Äù
Abe-Pizza_Bankruptcy,Funny. Didn‚Äôt he say in 2016 something along the lines of ‚ÄúWhy would you plead the fifth if you‚Äôre innocent?‚Äù. Hmmmm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
masstransience,"> ‚ÄúAnyone in my position not taking the fifth amendment would be a fool, an absolute fool,‚Äù Trump said.

What was meant was : Anyone in my position, as a guilty criminal, not taking the fifth amendment would be a fool, an absolute fool,‚Äù Trump said."
andrizella,If you don't have anything to hide....
moodyblue8222,Does everyone get to just plead the fifth and ignore subpoenas now or is it only privileged republicans?

BangkokPadang,"100, 200, 300, 400, FIF"
AltNationReality,"Based upon the specificity of the questions, I would conclude that they already know the answers to these questions and they just needed his ""testimony"" to be on the record.  He now knows what the attorney general has on him.  The ""Oh fuck"" blank stare of his eyes when they ask each question is fun to see."
snailfucked,A cute campaign ad would be a collection of clips of Trump saying only guilty people plead the fifth followed by a supercut of him pleading the fifth. Tight 15 seconds.
Gary-Fuckin-Oak,"So, according to Trump himself, he just confessed to being guilty 400 times.

LOCK! HIM! UP!"
southsky20,Only criminals plea the fifth - Drump
ProfessionalConfuser,"Trump said: ""So there are five people taking the Fifth Amendment. Like you see on the mob, right? You see the mob takes the Fifth. If you're innocent why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?"""
Distalgesic,According to the fat orange prick only guilty people plead the Fifth.
planetguitar67,"The big take out from this is since it‚Äôs a ‚Äúcivil‚Äù case, and it will go to a grand jury, pleading the fifth is looked upon negatively. This will most likely result in an indictment."
RelationshipVivid393,And still this Russian spy is going for re-election
MrBobSacamano,"I mean, what other options did he have when lying was off the table?"
BornInTheUSSA,Why can‚Äôt you just say it one time and be done with it?
Cirieno,"\> ""Anyone in my position not taking the fifth amendment would be a fool, an absolute fool,"" Trump said.

Only an absolute fool would have been directed as a useful idiot by those much more clever than he, who prefer to stay in the background.

Only a guilty fool would plead the Fifth 400 TIMES and expect anyone in the real world to consider him innocent.

Only a stupid fool will continue to support him... but we all know they will."
CactiiAnus,"Why not just bust out a giant sharpie and write Fiff on it. Just raise it as a your answer instead.  I thought we only had a limited battery life and the more we talk or exercise, the shorter our lives? I‚Äôm jus sayin. Everybody knows he‚Äôs got at least 4 or 5 sharpies in his pocket like I have 4 or 5 bic lighters in mine."
UbermachoGuy,Only guilty people plead the fifth. ~ Donald trump.
theChinStrikesAgain,He is clearly the best at pleading the fifth. All the best people would agree. Only losers and we're going to save america and let me tell you how we're going to do it but first Hillary and those not so good. I know. I know. Hillary and those not so good people want you to believe that we don't have the best fighter jets.
OhFaceXO,He made rick scott look like an amateur. Lmao ü§£
MercilessOcelot,"So apparently he does have a filter and knows when to shut his mouth.

Amazing how he acts when he has skin in the game and there are consequences.  He is such a massive man-child (no offense to children) that doesn't care when his words hurt others."
lilrickytony,"The terms ‚Äòso cringe‚Äô and ‚Äòick‚Äô are just so cringe and ick but that‚Äôs what he does to me. He‚Äôs so cringe and ick I can‚Äôt stand it.


Honestly I‚Äôd love to know a hardcore trump guy and be able to observe the mental gymnastics they have to do to stay in love with him .

Can you imagine the sheer joy when that person finally says ‚ÄúI was wrong. So wrong. He‚Äôs just a conman l‚Äù or however they‚Äôd choose to frame it."
Astro_Astro,And he still will never have a bad day or face any consequences for his myriad crimes.
PartyViking23,"When I said ‚Äúpeople who plead the 5th are guilty‚Äù that was for you commoners not for me!

- Donald Trump"
LudovicoSpecs,"400 different times he couldn't speak because it would be incriminating.

Got it."
redwing180,Someone needs to do a mashup of trump pleading the fifth all of those times with edits of him saying how only criminals plead the fifth after every time he pleads the fifth.
ThatsFairZack,"Deponent: Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth and nothing but the truth?

Trump: I plead the 5th.

Deponent: Can you state your full name, middle included for the recording?

Trump: My name is Donald J Trump.

Deponent: Your full name Mr. Trump. Middle Included. Your middle name is John, is that correct?

Trump: I plead the 5th.

Deponent: So can you state todays date for us Mr. Trump?

Trump: It's January 31. Lovely day, beautiful. Best month of the year, best day. 31 is a great number. A number that means so much to many people, it's so important to them like you wouldn't believe.

Deponent: And the year?

Trump: *leans over to lawyer without making contact with eyes focused more just off camera left*

Lawyer: *shakes head in a quick few nods*

Trump: *leans back over into his sitting position*

Trump: *stares at the Deponent*

Trump: I plead the 5th."

Party_Ad_9362,"Someone needs to get rid of him. Like seriously, if you had a chance to get rid of Hitler before WWWII, wouldn't you? This guy is on the same scale of narcissism."
ShamanSix01,"To take the Fifth, is to prevent one from incriminating themself. In other words, one pleads the Fifth so they don‚Äôt have to tell the courts their crime. This guy plead the Fifth over 400 times, so how many of those are actual crimes?"
JawshRacer,"Ah yes, refusing to cooperate‚Ä¶the mark of an innocent man."
WearyMoose307,This changes nothing to his cult
TheBigPhilbowski,Fraud deposition... deposition of a fraud.

EL_ZILCHO345,""" The mob takes the fifth ""

Donald Trump"
dogbreakfast,>That makes me smart
veni_vedi_concretum,That would make him the four hundred and forty 5th president.
TyphosTheD,"While Trump's hypocrisy around the 5th amendment is worth criticism, it's important to remember that the 5th Amendment is vital to protecting the people against overzealous prosecutors and/or coercive police.

I'm certainly willing to acknowledge I'm missing something vital, but if the prosecution is asking him these questions, questions which may incriminate, it suggests to me that don't have evidence of the things they are asking about."
Kerbob,"> The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States protects individuals from self-incrimination.
Finally a confession he's a criminal!"
whereismymind86,Look...I don't want to call for the repeal of the 5th amendment but...this nonsense has to stop.
Etherius,"Nope

Nope nope nope 

Hate trump all you want.  It‚Äôs a shit take to get pissy over someone availing themselves of their fifth amendment rights

There have been dozens of attorney videos showing why answering questions you don‚Äôt ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO is a **terrible** idea"
ArthurMorgan514,"Is this another deposition or the old one?   I already knew he had pleaded the 5th over 400 times in front of congress, but did he do it again?"

Special_FX_B,"The lifelong criminal who said only the guilty plead the 5th which, by definition, is an admission of guilt. By answering the question honestly, self-incrimination might happen."
No1has1,Of course he does. I do remember some telling everyone that he was the greatest president ever and only mobsters and criminals please the fifth. I just can‚Äôt remember the guys name though.
bpon89,He‚Äôs totally going to drop the ball somewhere and end up in more deep deep shh.t  imagine the person who sat there to count the 400 times of Trump pleading the fifth.

Fuck these Nazis."
striker69,"400 fu*king times, holy hell"
DonnyMox,It's practically his catchphrase at this point.
Brilliant-Engineer57,That‚Äôs because he is a fraud.
Some_Confection_3801,While he is guilty‚Ä¶ it is a bad precedent to set that pleading the fifth means your guilty
Acceptable_Wall4085,There is also a video out where trump says only criminals use the fifth amendment. I wish I knew where it could be found.
No_Sentence289,Guilty people don't plead the 5th..
Abnatural,"If someone would be so kind to explain, what happens now since he refused to say anything that could incriminate himself? Which I think is incriminating in itself! (canadian asking here)  
Is the onus now on counsel to prove him guilty?"
kylegyle,Think this guy might be a fraud
APintOfFreshAir,"We‚Äôve all been around for a while. We know what‚Äôs going to happen next.

Kamelasa,"Ugh, another heinous picture of Dolt45 looking exactly like a twin of my illiterate neighbour who has no emotional skills. He's her identical twin. Yikes. Nightmare fuel. Thankfully, such people can't reproduce as fast as bacteria, but two of them at the same time gives me the double creeps."
CrawlerSiegfriend,I don't understand why anyone would actually participate in a deposition beyond pleading the fifth. Depositions are a lose lose situation.
skaag,So can criminals plead the fifth to avoid jail time?
--zaxell--,Coulda saved time and just pleaded the 2000th instead.
Fuzzy_Accident_5085,"That‚Äôs called an Alford plea in a court of law, and yea it means your guilty. So now the DA just needs to tell him how much jail time he‚Äôll serve."

Glissandra1982,Shocked Pikachu face.
Niftyone578,"Trump should have been instructed to say ""I plead the 5th"" for every question instead of being given the opportunity by the prosecution lawyer to say ""Same Answer"" each time."
Kiron00,So glad we created that pesky 5th amendment. Only now do I realize what kind of people it was made for‚Ä¶
NightSavings,"*Yes, some do plead the 5th, but 400 times is not right. Time to put in jail for all the crimes he has had his hands in. What is now wrong with America? Is going to be a country of laws? or a country were part of its people and states just ignore laws? It has come down were a state's and there people just don't want follow the laws that have been passed in Washington. As far as I know they are all represented in congress. As soon as something goes different to there thinking they want out. You know like Trump the little baby.                (  Pleading the 5th 400 times ) Something is wrong here.*"
M142Man,That's a lot of pleading

BuckshotLaFunke,Mob.
dustymag,typical reagan shit. y'all wanted it ya got it.
Any_Classic_9490,"This is a man banking on taking this case up to the supreme court and having his friends toss out any judgement against him.

Pleading the fifth like this in a civil case virtually guarantees that trump loses this case in court.  Juries and judges are allowed to assume the answer is incriminating when you plead the fifth in a civil case.

He could have gone with ""I don't recall"", but this approach is going to give the chance to the supreme court to invalidate ""adverse inference"" when pleading the fifth in civil court.  This change will empower every scam artist and fraudster there is.  As a fraudster, you can ignore a civil case against you and plead the fifth for everything if judges and juries cannot hold it against you.  It invalidates the entire civil court system which removes the only remedy most victims have.  Like alex jones lying about school shootings. That could only be dealt with in civil court because prosecutors in the US no longer care about prosecuting snake oil salesman type of fraud schemes due to ""free speech""."
bigjoe65,I don't see how this is news. Unfortunately this is par for the course. I don't know how anyone would have expected anything else from this turdsack.

Captnlunch,Lunatics gonna loon.
vnmslsrbms,"He's always got a reason for everything.  And some people will always eat it up.  Though, I think in this case it's better legally to just plead the fifth since he's guilty as heck.  Wouldn't be smart to incriminate himself now wouldn't he."

PoopLogg,"I hate Trump as much as any other decent human, but I don't expect him to self-incriminate. 

He's an idiot when it comes to running a country or statesmanship or international dialogue, but he's a pro at court.  How is this newsworthy? 

If someone finds themselves to be a defendant in the legal system, literally everybody should plead the fifth instead of talking, whether it's a cop or a judge."

Zealousideal_Mix4250,They say pleading the 5th = GUILTY!!!
CrushTheRebellion,"In Trump's mind he's not pleading the fifth, he's saying ""I refuse to answer your questions because I shouldn't have to"". He thinks he's above the law and most likely is from what I've witnessed to date. The game is rigged, folks."
