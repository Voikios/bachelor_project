dmigowski,Is this screenshot from before vertical conveyers?
At_Destroyer,Wdym people said you donâ€™t need storage? Itâ€™s been a bit since I played but I like to have at least a container or two as buffer so I can grab shit out of it to build with
R0ckandr0ll_318,Dude you arenâ€™t using the big containers! You need to use them now! Mwah ha ha ha
xloHolx,"Cable goes in, wire comes out

Itâ€™s the desembler"
Super_Cheburek,"I did a 4 huge container wide, 20 high caterium ore buffer tower when I started the game..."
Cosmocision,The correct reaction to someone telling you how to play is always to double down. Good job.

0LowLight0,Sto-rage
notsoy,"If you're going to store a large volume of something, at least do it with something you actually need an extremely large volume of compared to the stack size. Wires are the exact opposite of this since they stack to 500 and most buildings that need it don't need very much"
Delicious-News-9698,"Congratulations, you played yourself."
Arlassa,I was also told I don't need more energy reserves... so I increased my reserves.
SirDoofusMcDingbat,"I gotta respect spite-based factory designs. :D

Looks cool too. And hey, the ultimate goal is always to make something cool, so as far as I'm concerned you're winning!"

Fkeolciuxr,Uhhh good luck getting rid of it as you progress
Specht100,"If my calculation is correct, there is enough space to hold 288.000 items. Why do you need that much wire."
DucNuzl,"You don't need storage.

(Okay, you'll make it bigger now, right?)"
tidematz,"If thatâ€™s just wire, how big is your screw storage?"
QlimaxUK,LetsGameItOut would approve of this
chimmelrick,"*ohhh noooooo, don't build storage containers until your framerate is begging for mercy!*"
CycleZestyclose1907,"I feel like once you got to your second layer of containers, you should have started using the double stacked ones.

Then again, I got a couple stacks of three high single containers sitting in my base. They contain biomass because I'm a hoarder who just can't bear to throw away any miscellanious vegetation I pick up while exploring the world."
houghi,I like how you do not even care that it is all mixed and a pain later to get what you want because having dedicated containers is so much easier.
TrueNorthStrong1898,This made my eyes bleed
_mortache,Reminds me of the human centipede ðŸ¤£
MIT-Engineer,"Utterly pointless, but pretty cool!"
KrazyKirby99999,"if you have too much of something, simply let it backup and slow production automatically. helps save power"
Lashida,"Not sure that I ever would need something like this, but it sure looks nice :)"
Super_Cheburek,said what ?
KLTechNerd,I like it.
Bruhhhh0224,Wait till you get the industrial sized bins
mctownley,Stick it to the Man!
WolfeIsntWolfie,Yes
SheepDogCO,Iâ€™d love to see video of them spinning around.
Rick_bo,Makes me want to build storage Silos for each material.
super-reddit-lord28,reminds me of the tower of fuel
Croanosus,Turbo motors next please
YouMyron,Moar!
Canadarm_Faps,This looks like my tower of terror! Hundreds of industrial storage containers with nuclear waste
xizar,I've set up storage towers like this just to watch everything move past... it's soothing.
SoraMurasaki,The factory must grow! Oh wait wrong sub
cozmokittylord,I have never been more afraid of both a storage unit and the person who built it.
red_penta,this looks ... beautiful
LuigisRandomPosts,"When ever i play this game i always have 2 storage for each ressource just in case i need it at anypoint during my playthrough lol, and i assure you itâ€™s definitely useful if you need extra ressources"
Polydipsiac,As long as you had fun doing it itâ€™s all that matters :)
CouldntThinkOf1,Like an expertly plated helping of spaghetti
rootoomoo,Not enough storage
tordonegro,Your factory. Your rules... great job buddy
Weak_Assignment_3054,I Always make something called the â€˜Blockâ€™. Its an elevated foundation ( and walls + pillars to make it look like a factory building). I put storages on top of it and connect them via lifts going down to the bottom of the build. Then when I make something new I route it to the box via a conveyer highway. This way I always have everything I need close to hand.
Ok-Error-4597,"I like using slopes, I got satisfactory after lifts, so never had to sove hight problems. Maybe I try without belt lifts so I understand u peoples delight of old."
juberish,"I had to take down all my buffer containers because they created slow downs on my conveyor belts, whenever troubleshooting lines not getting as many resources as they should, it often comes down to a glitched container, now I don't put them on any high volume lines.


In the pic showing, you just end up getting full containers and then only one stack keeps trading one in and one out from there, there's just no good reason to store this many, might as well throw em in the sync."
loughtthenot,Well at tleast they got waste containers prepped in advance
Lemme_eat_your_pvssy,"Only massive storage I will need is for plutonium waste if I want over 20,000 game hours worth of 80x nuclear plants running at 250% (all 4 unranium nodes with 250% MK3 miners). Surely there has to be a trick besides save file hacking and lizard dogs to toss that shit off the map. Until then it goes to the lowest possible foundation in the southeast abyss with the plants near the top of the atmosphere so most radioactivity is easy to stay away from (even most of the uranium ore is belted around the upper edge of the map that hurts to touch anyway). In the real world I guess it would be filling up the Mariana Trench, or that area at the bottom of the Pacific where most unburned space junk ends up, with the nuclear plants a couple of km above the ocean surface."
danczer,"AFAIK if your input speed is the same as your output, you basically does not store any item in the storage, so it basically acts as a conveyor belt, with extras. Does anybody calculated what is the speed of the storage box? If you put 100 after each other and connect them with Mk[x], the total speed over distance would be: over, equal or less than a long line of Mk[x] belt?"
Treacle_Individual,"you should check out ""Lets game it out"" for more cool looking stuff this guy josh has done the  unimagineable lol   search youtube for (lets game it out satisfactory) he also had vids on other games as well"
