loyaltomyself,Why not delay it an extra 6 days past that?
LoserBean17,Just get it right. I don‚Äôt care how late it gets delayed. Just get. It. Right.
Varuvk2090,"Nice, now I have time to play the other games coming"
Xandergram,Good
JuicyXantibody,"Is it weird that I feel happy to see a delay? I remember back in the day when people would get bummed out because of delays, but now it feels like they‚Äôre putting good effort into the game rather than rushing it out."
VanceXentan,Delays>Rushed products.
The_Elder_Jock,"""We apologise for ensuring we release a game in a good and coherent state.""

It is a strange timeline."
yama1291,"Might as well, February is pretty full of releases already and a bit more polish won't hurt."
AnimZero,Good. Too many games are getting released in embarrassing technical states and then stuck in patch hell for months before they're cleanly playable (if ever).
North-Function995,"These are the devs of Titanfall 2. Im not even looking at this game but Im happy Respawn is doing well, and that theyre not afraid to make necessary delays to deliver something right."
MrErnie03,"The game was just announced like 2 months ago, so this delay is less painful than usual"
gamingonion,Gives me more time to play the first one lol
jixxor,This is good communication and sound reasoning.
NukeCake,Honestly might as well make the release date may 4th . Would be sick for sure
gschmoke22,"GOOD delays are good, fuck overtime and overworking employees"
Jet44444,Good cause I just started Jedi fallen order.
zillskillnillfrill,"Take your time EA, nobody's in a rush."
Saber_Saber,So they plan to release it on my birthday
CrackedDad,Those little white lines on the top left made me think I had hairs on my screen
Senor_Wah,"Unfortunate, but I‚Äôm glad game studios are more becoming more willing to delay games rather than have disastrous launches. I know which I‚Äôd prefer"
beetnemesis,"Honestly, good. A delayed game is nearly always a better one."
bpelkey23,They could delay an entire year if it drops without an issue I'll be happy. Sick of paying the 60$ for it to drop with a million bugs. Mad respect to Respawn for stepping out like this.
PirateThatIsUndead,Honestly this is fine. They announced the game less than 6 months ago (?). I‚Äôm not in a rush. I love this actually
daggerpwna,Forspoken should have done this. Six months minimum
ReapCreep65,May 4th plz
ABrokenBinding,TIL it takes 6 weeks to write all the code for EAs loot crates
RevElliotSpenser,I got bored with the first one
Beneficial_Star_6009,EA taking more time to polish a much anticipated game before it‚Äôs official release? What planet is this!?!
ComeonmanPLS1,"I‚Äôm writing the death threats right now. Don‚Äôt worry gamers, I got you. üòé"
morgan423,"Honestly: good.

Far too many games pushed out the door unfinished in the modern day.  I'd love to see that trend reversed."
legalthrowaway565656,"Can‚Äôt even be mad.

Applaud this.

Encourage this.

I‚Äôd rather complain a game is pushed back for an entire YEAR then ever get something buggy and half polished earlier."
InevitableTraining69,So strange respawn acting like they care after ruining Apex Legends by running it into the ground just for a quick buck.
Mrhere_wabeer,"Ooohhhhh nooooo, how terrible!!! How could this beeeee? You mean I have to wait a couple weeks?!?! How will one survive????"
itzTHATgai,Forspoken could've used a few delays.
KingHavana,"Is this the sequel to that dark souls style jedi game with the occasional platforming as you did some parkour?  That was a fun game. Fallen order, I think."
FRED44444,Get it right so i don't have to fucking get back to my ship each fucking level. Dont make me go through a maze back to my ship. That is not fun.
UnkownArty13,crazy how EA is now delaying games in 2023. hopefully this is a sign that they learned not to rush games lol
Neorevan0,"Yes, I love this. Now I don‚Äôt have to worry about Tax Season when this game comes out!"
Lord_MagnusIV,Why not 7 weeks so they can launch it on may the 4th
Arcticwolfi6,would rather this happen than it release with bugs and stutter
Mitchthe2nd,Perfect. Happy. Good on em
KingBlackthorn1,I‚Äôm okay with that. I had too many games between Feb and March lol. Got myself stressed out with how many
ImDraconLion,rather it‚Äôs delayed rather than becoming another shite on EA‚Äôs table
illumin8ted72,"More developers need to do this rather than release a flawed product. I was starting to think quality didn‚Äôt matter anymore, Thank you Respawn.

Yes it is disappointing to wait longer but it is comforting to know developers are wise enough to realize that they don‚Äôt have to spend 2 years earning back fans trust ( and likely have to rehire a bunch of team members to do so ) if they just take an extra 6 weeks right now."
ChettiBoiM8,"Good, delay games as much as needed"
SonOfECTGAR,"Their releasing it on my birthday just for me, awww how nice."
Wiamly,"There are SO MANY GAMES out, one could never finish all the quality games already out there. 

For the love of god, polish it to perfection. Respawn fucking rules, they know how to finish a game. Delay it until it‚Äôs ready, fully support this"
gigaswardblade,Bruh I thought there was hair on my screen because of those lines in the top left.
fostertheatom,OK that's fair.
GomeroKujo,As long as the game works I‚Äôm happy
IAMLightning01,Where's Titanfall 3 at Respawn???
ConesMalone,Honestly I‚Äôm not mad. I was trying to figure out how the hell I could play everything that was coming out in march anyways
Pizzadontdie,What games haven‚Äôt been delayed.  No one‚Äôs taking release dates seriously in 2023. It‚Äôs all a joke. It‚Äôll come out between 6 months and 2 years later than originally stated.
wykah,"This is indicative of a go-live date being more important than a finished product, and why we get to play incomplete games on day 1."
CataclysmDM,Fine by me. You only get one chance at a first impression.
Meta_Boy,"Wow. I am so excited for this. And this is how I find out ...

... that it was supposed to come out in March already?? I am stoked, April is basically tomorrow anyway. Let's fucking gooooo"
BisexualCactusNoises,Good. Fuck crunch time. Fuck bad work environments. Give them another year if they need it.
GuessWhoItsJosh,Cool with that. About halfway through Fallen Order right now. Guess I'll have a nice little break between them now.
Darklord_Bravo,"Good. This means less chances of performance issues at launch. I'm all for it. Also, I have several other games that it would have overlapped with. This gives me some breathing room to play them. Respawn thankfully, has high standards. This isn't a big deal for me."
Lwe12345,"A delay never means it will be more polished on release. It means they‚Äôre scrambling because the deadline was way too ambitious, and they have to find the right balance between unfinished and ruining the hype. Not a good omen"
squibubbles,Delays honestly are a breath of fresh air these days. Shows commitment to releasing a good product and that the devs are being honest about the state of the game.
Lucifersasshole,When companies do this people need to be chill about it. It's better than releasing a half finished game. Which seems to be becoming industry standard.
Successful-Whole4307,I literally downloaded and started playing the first one for the first time today. I can wait
gargamel314,"This is disappointing, but it's good to see them prioritizing quality over the almighty $."
JoeyFreshwater92,It‚Äôs crazy how 10+ years ago this was sad news but now I love it haha
Entropy1991,Who are these people and what have they done with EA?
Jestersage,"So, Respawn:

* You are delaying Jedi Survivor
* You have no content for S15 and even upcoming S16 on Apex
* You are closing down ApexM.

Mmm...."
ChefHannibal,That's fine.  Put out a finished game.
Worien03,Who cares. Delay it as long as necessary to release a finished product that is polished and complete. Apparently this is too much to ask for these days.
bruhwhome,"Take all the damn time, I hate when developers just rush a game. I rather wait 3 or 5 years for a game then get a shitty one that'll be good after the 3 or 5 years of patches."
beetea72_74,"It is better to deliver a finished product, I'm tired of doing the beta testing after I pay for a full game. And remember, no pre-orders!"
irish_steelste,Ea definitely going to release this broken 3 years and its still delayed CASH GRAB 100% ‚ö†Ô∏è
Odiwan-Kenobi,"Take your time, we'll be waiting. The force is with you."
KeystrokeCowboy,People who preorder deserve this..
foxyxz,"Poor developers, no sleep for 6 more weeks. Sounds like crunch time untill release..."
icantreeee,Didn't want to go toe to toe with RE4 remake
Froticlias,Tool is a great band because they take their time and set a release date when their stuff is ready. A lot of companies could learn from that.
Trimere,Boycott EA.
StannisLivesOn,I am okay with this.
Illuminaso,"I love how they say this like it's a sad thing. I'm like ""YEAH!!! Delay it more! Make it as good as it can possibly be!""

&#x200B;

I'm patient. I'll play it and enjoy it whenever it comes out. They won't lose my sale over this. I need them to understand that delaying games isn't a bad thing."
Lupe499,Rather delay than release a half finished game
SirReal10000,Good. Every delay means release will be better.
cosmernaut420,"Dear every other developer:

Just do this."
gba-sp-101,Better delayed than shit
diggydillons,This is a bad sign
tyehyll,Dead Island 2 be like üëÄ
Darktyde,"Where‚Äôs that Ep III Darth Vader gif when I need it

Edit: prediction: the game drops April 28th and then a week later on May the Fourth they unveil a live action Cal Kestis project"
EvelynnLilith,Even better! Comes out on my B-day now!
RocketPowah,"Now a days with the amount of great games out to play, it's no issue to pick something up while these delayed games get a good polish."
LightmanHUN,"Its alright, february is too stacked already."
FallenRanger,I'm so pumped for this game. This team has to do what it has to do. Looking forward to it.
Fapasaurus_Rex1291,Fine with me. I wanna play a complete game. I don‚Äôt mind waiting.
SCHARKBAIT11,I mean w the past track records of last years games .. I would say that‚Äôs okay with me if it‚Äôs actually done when they release it
CaptianLedger,Glad they're taking the time to make sure it's released with no problems.  6 weeks is nothing
Moody_GenX,I ain't mad. I'm glad they're going to release a product with minimal bugs.
J4k1415,"Delay anything as much as possible idc.

Just make a good game."
hutt1010,"Good, send out the best product possible. No need to rush out glitches and crashes!"
-praughna-,6 weeks is 100% reasonable to me
LevelStudent,"No big deal, happens a lot right now and there's no rush it's just a game.

If you're scheduling time off for a game release this far in advance still you're basically asking for it."
adderrson,Seems like a missed opportunity to not release the game on May the 4th if you ask me seeing how this date is so close to that.
JigsawNightmare,Sweet. Comes out closer to my birthday now.
Zyker,"Before it was right around my birthday and was going to be a gift... Now I have to get it for my baby's birthday and that's way harder to pull off, rationale-wise."
czartrak,"This is the one game currently I want to be 100% right, so im down for them to take as much time as they need"
pantherghast,"\*Insert Darth Vader ""NOOOOOOOO"" here\*"
hendrix899,"As long as the quality is good, it doesn,t matter if it gets delayed a bit. I was actually afraid they were going to rush this game because Fallen Order was so succesful."
smogop,"Just in time, since PS5 was FINALLY released as of a few days ago instead dripping out like coffee out of a coffee machine. I can literally go into the store, today, and buy one with an hour."
d_rek,"Enter crunch mode, you will"
eXclurel,Understandable. Have a nice day.
Spodson,I know a lot of gamers hate these announcements. But maybe it means the crunch at the end will be minimized for the workers.
murcielagoXO,This is how they win me over.
Mau533y,"Noooooooo, I booked time off work to play this!! üò≠üò≠"
Bowens1993,"Oof, it must be in a pretty bad state right now."
chrish_1977,Gotta get the micro transactions sorted out
Genus109,i hope it‚Äôs good. Because fan of the property are barely surviving as it is. Plus the title sounds like they‚Äôre in a therapy session. ‚Äúshow me where the Sith hurt you‚Äù
Robman0908,Another title delay. Shocking
Warlord68,"If it means fixing issues, DELAY!!"
Plamen_K,"For the love of god, developers should learn to delay things for as long as they want, so long as we dont get another halo infinite or cyberpunk (i dont wanna start writing a book so ill stop there)"
AcademicApricot2600,By the time it comes out Noone will have the money or the time it takes to watch the movie..be to busy hiding from the nuke fallout of the war.
MojoRyzn,"‚ÄúThanks to EA and Respawn for giving us the time to deliver the best experience for our players‚Äù. 
Who is ‚Äúus‚Äù? Isn‚Äôt this a statement from EA and Reapawn? Why are they talking like they are not them? Weird."
Emoretal,Delay it for as long as it‚Äôs needed for us to get a bug free game. The bar is high. Please driver quality.
SizzlerGuestWIFI,Okay with it. Just make it good.
helloiamdog,"""A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.""
- Shigeru Miyamoto"
mr_streebs,"Video game publishers need to start asking when the devs think it'll be ready and then announce the game 6 weeks after what the devs say. 

In all seriousness I want them to take their time"
Stravis86,No problem if it means it releases in a better state than it would have
Alternative_Gold_993,Good. Make it right.
FaZ3bubb1e,This is actually good. They are taking the time to perfect their game. They also may have found some problems with the game and are fixing them
StoicSmile-,"I bought fallen order last month for $10 (just before playstation plus gave it out) mostly because my friend said it was like a souls game if you played on the hardest difficulty.

I am genuinely surprised what a great game it was. I‚Äôm nearly done the story and clean up for trophies. Im blown away at how well they pulled this off. This makes me happy to see, I‚Äôll definitely be buying this one."
ContinuumGuy,I'm glad it's getting delayed. My gaming schedule is jam-packed right now.
TheBroccoliBobboli,Let's just hope they release a good game eventually. Doesn't really matter when exactly.
Top_One6911,"I‚Äôm disappointed, but If the game will be better for this, personally I‚Äôm willing to wait"
netsuj34,"If my meal isn‚Äôt done cooking, I am more than willing to wait longer than eat it undercooked. We can wait"
Sillyvanya,"#NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooo

(jk I hope they take as much time as they need)

(also yes that was the Vader one)"
intercop,That's the right decision. It's better to see a finished game later than to get a raw product.
datalinklayer,"Lol everyone upvoted people saying ""good"". You all really think an extra 6 weeks will make that much of a difference? If it's being delayed than there are problems and probably will still have problems on release. The first one was full of issues on launch and which game that has been delayed in recent memory was actually perfect on release? I cant think of any."
Grumpul,It's gonna bomb.
1gq2nvqr,Bad sign.
flyhi808,Does any game come out on time at all these days?
Damerman,Im kind of happy about this. Im trying to foster an unhealthy obsession with VII remake.
JoshuaNLG,Why do they even give us release dates at this point? We all know everythings gonna get fucking delayed anyway.
jillsvalentine,"Honestly I was a little worried with only having a week to get through this before Resident Evil 4 Remake came out, so I‚Äôm happy to wait a bit so this can get the polish it needs and we deserve."
underdogsurvivor2020,Yeah cool. Just give us finished game
Spidey703,EA is wack and will ruin it. Mark my words. If they are smart they will learn from Breath Of The Wild. But it is EA. And EA loves money grabs...-Optimistic Obi-Wan
13xnono,The micro transactions system must of had a serious bug.
naterninja550,"Maybe they should try and get the date right. You guys getting conditioned for delays as if it will make a big difference. Downvote me, but it‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs the reason that games like skull and bones and dead island are taking so long even though they will come out mid."
Mission_Cause368,"It‚Äôll still be riddled with bugs because EA is involved, yet people will be surprised."
RealEyesRealize420,Games are just a joke and have been the past few years they need to stop announcing the game until it is ready!!!
oX_deLa,"Got it!
Those poor guys are being overworked to death AND the game is gonna be a shit show! üòâüëç"
