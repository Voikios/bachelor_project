Choripan_Lig_Salado,The only good bug is a dead bug
robowy,Instead of the cats we should have an option to make the spiders into glyphjds
lurkylurkylurky12345,Can confirm.  I want to snuggle DRG’s Steeve and I am terrified of Satisfactory’s spindly abominations.
Blind0bserver,"Spiders in Satisfactory are what makes my nice, calm factory sandbox game turn into survival horror for five minute blocks at a time and they are the bane of my existence."
RevanPrime,Do I hear a rock and stone?
TrainWreck661,"Nah, I like my arachnids like coffee beans. Roasted."
krizzlybear,We're Rich!
Bosht,Where are there spiders in Valheim??? I've played through the entire thing and have never seen spider based enemies. Closest would be Seekers in the Mistlands but they're more akin to wasps than spiders.
Wise-Air-1326,Someone needs to go to the QA site and suggest that we can turn an arachnid into a Steve on Satisfactory.
InvaderM33N,"I dunno, man, you ever fought a Hiveguard?"
Drathymuffin,"Like satisfactory spiders are scary

But Grounded for all its cartoony graphics has put the fear of god in me when it comes to spiders."
Laellion,What about goat simulator?
mattheaddong,"Sorry but no dang way, an Elite Stinger or Praetorian Oppressor doesn't compare to the horrors that are the insects in the Mistlands"
Canadarm_Faps,"I’m not sure what’s more scary, green spiders or any spider with nuke nobelisk stuck to it"
ChazCharlie,"I had no idea DRG was a coffee stain game! I frequent the Darktide sub and they praise it very highly, contrasting CSS favourably against Fatshark's greed. I love Valheim and Satisfactory, so bought DRG today. Got 69% off the big bundle.

Nice."
BigMelonBoi,"I only play in arachnophobia, any time i see one of those green fuckers the nuke nobelisks come out no questions asked"
Terra_throwaway,Glyphids aren't arachnids and they're only called spiders because Terrans don't know any better.
Wallbreaker93,ROCK AND STONE!
MrUniverse1990,Recently started playing DRG. Rock and Stone!
Invertdoctopus,I'm real new to the game. I've maybe been playing a couple of weeks and I just fell into the deep end and I don't want to get out now. I've only had a couple of run ins with spiders so far and they're real annoying little buggers. My problem in this game is with hogs. Those things are like rats. They're everywhere and they all want to fight! Gawd I love this game.
jaydon-Ad8648,Wait until you go to grounded.
Collistoralo,"I’m in both the Satisfactory sub and the DRG one, and as I was reading through the comments of this post I assumed I was in the DRG one. I forgot how vocal we were. ROCK AND STONE!"
JackErskine,Does this game have a no monsters mode yet
No-Obligation7435,3rd times the charm
Mizar97,"Even playing with the aliens on passive mode, I still have a miniature heart attack every time I see a spider skitter by."
fupa16,"If the Gjall counts as an arachnid, then it would be at the bottom of the list."
HeatGoneHaywire,Fewer*
gendulf,"Another game of ""what do these things have in common.""  Working with knowledge of only Valheim and Satisfactory, so challenge mode."
AetherMagnetic,That's why I carry nobelisks around as a primary source of self-defense
I__be_Steve,"Those little buggers freak me out so bad, especially the big ones, there's no reason for something that terrifying to be that large"
Substantial_Bag_9536,"Me : « omg this spider is creepy, glad she is aw… »
Spider : *JUMP*"
TheSangson,"My gf and I played Valheim quite a while, but we're only at the ""iron age"" so far (iron weapons and tools, that is, we don't have a lot of the stuff), just barely surviving short trips through the plains. I don't remember having seen any arachnids.   
Oh, how I'm looking forward to the other biomes now (unless this means Abominations in which case this meme sucks)."
The_Tilly,"I see this sub is still a karma harvest for people pretending to be afraid of spiders, then"
ItsLose_NotLoose,"Not to be that guy, but Coffee Stain doesn't make Valheim. They just published it."
