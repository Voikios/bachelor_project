Le_Goose_de_Mon,"I bought satisfactory for 2 of my friends while im upgrading my computer. Their so proud with their builds and their speed running on one system.

Im over here like... ""eventually you'll know enough to pop in my game, right?"""
Kylarus,I legit had to check my discord notifications while watching this. Also your friend seems to be doing alright for so early. His spaghet doesn't seem so horrible.
swiftshadow17,I feel called out. Leave my spaghetti factory alone!
CNC_er,Ah the joys of having friends with gaming computers.
Etherius,You should introduce him to Let’s Game It Out so he can get a feel for how the game is meant to be played
MAXIMUM-WORF,I see nothing wrong here
themarknessmonster,Those lift tentacles are beautiful.
aldfrarug,FFS just searched for two minutes who just sent me something on discord until I noticed the video was playing in the background
BillytheBrassBall,Don't correct him. The first factory you build is always the best.
drizzit_d,"Looks like way more order then my first base to be honest, I wouldnt complain about that for a start at all. Im sure it will be super ordered in no time"

Heyythere777,I currently have just started the game. My factory looks something like this. How can I improve it? Will I naturally learn to make better ones?
Kiritsu_X,"He's no more your friend.  He's one of us now!

Just joking.  Maybe you could ask him to be part of it.."
Kahnvoy,You're a good friend.
SometimesKnowsStuff_,Ah it reminds me of my first factory

EcstaticAd8693,ಠ_ಠ
doktortaru,"My friends are obsessed with cramming everything close together.
