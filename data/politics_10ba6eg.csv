Liopera,"The Citizens United case from 2010 has caused this mess. Foreign dollars funding US politicians. The country used to have relatively agreed upon standards, and a proven fraud like this would have been run out of town a long time ago. (R) s have lowered  standards."
Intelligent-Travel-1,Russian asset?
KickBassColonyDrop,"He's an experiment to test the structural weakness of the election process. I called it and it's all coming out to be true.

Expect 10-30x Santos' in 2024."
thefoodiedentist,"When Oppedisano was arrested on his 63-foot Sunseeker yacht, the INXS FINALLY, in December 2019 off the coast of Miami, the Coast Guard found he was smuggling over a dozen undocumented migrants from the Bahamas to Florida. They also said they found over $200,000 in U.S. and Bahamian currency hidden behind a panel in a closet on board. He was sentenced to time served and three years of supervised release.

Oppedisano lived in the United States from the age of 5 with his family in New York, but he was deported from the country in January 2019 according to court documents. CBS News was unable to confirm Oppedisano's current whereabouts, but the donation receipt from Santos' campaign included a Whitestone, N.Y., address believed to belong to Oppedisano's parents. CBS made repeated attempts to reach Oppedisano but received no response. 

Members of Oppedisano's family also donated to Santos's campaign. His brother and niece, who run an Italian restaurant in Queens called Il Bacco, were appointed to Santos' Small Business coalition. Santos, who posted that he frequented Il Bacco on Instagram, spent more than $25,000 at the establishment on his campaign's dime since his first failed attempt to win a seat in Congress in 2020, according to FEC records. The disbursements were filed under meeting charges or food and beverage expenses between 2020 and 2022, covering both of Santos's races for office. The campaign also owed nearly $19,000 to the restaurant for an ""Election Night Event."" 


THIS IS THE REAL STORY RIGHT HERE!"
bildo72,This dude is a limbo champion for how low you can set the bar and still not reach it
_JunkyardDog,What's the over/under on the number of Mooches this clod lasts?
MountainMoments,"In a more civilized era his own party would have forced him to resign weeks ago. Alas, this is 2023 and he's actually less batshit crazy and owned by foreign interests than the average far right republican nut job. He's just more open with his villainy."
Imacatdoincatstuff,There’s still a central figure connecting George to all this that remains unknown. Dude didn’t have all these connections himself.
gogojack,"At this point I'm halfway to thinking he's a test case.

The GOP created him with the sole purpose of figuring out ""just how much bullshit can we get away with and still not lose support?""

Are they taking notes on every new scandal?

""Okay, our base doesn't seem to mind the fake Holocaust stuff...release the next one.  They're not too bothered about the lying about being a volleyball star bit...next one?  Wow.  The fact that he molested children in a pizza parlor basement didn't move the needle.  Who knew?""


They're setting a baseline to see just what they can reasonably get away with. 

So far it's...everything."

Brazil had a cozy relationship with Russia for a long time, and of course is like Sweden in that it's a place Nazis go to blend in... The fact that he gave the 'White Power' sign makes me think he's a Nazi as well. I don't doubt for a second that we'll be seeing this guy on the Intelligence Committee or something similar - McCarthy has his orders..."

AbsurdWorld1957,I’m really surprised about the Russian connection.
Sujjin,"The level of influence that foreign governments and other actors can have on our elections is blatantly ridiculous.  All because campaign finance laws are so lacking and the enforcement of what laws there are is weak to the point that they might as well not exist anyway.

All so congressman can add an extra zero to their bank account now and then"

Maximum_Ad_155,This guy looks like the ultimate political villain that everyone would hate
mrthingz,Ah yes republicans
Particular-Summer424,"Ok. Here's what a lot of people don't understand about this guy. Yes, he's a liar, an open fraud, has fabricated his past, committed crimes in other countries, made wild claims about his accomplishments, wildly embellished facts about himself, his background, personal life, his education and his family and has questionable campaign contributors and affiliations. 

He ran for office and won. Showed up and was sworn in. 

Then the lies came out. Well, not really, the lies were always there. 

What he really represents is the glaring disconnect on voters doing due diligence or fact checking on who the person is on their ballots is, instead of being lazy and taking the validity of mass media and campaign facts as the truth. Something not even his opponents for the same office fail to do also. 

So, he is elected.

And he shows up. And someone started doing fact-checking on who the new guy in town is about. The lies and falsehoods come pouring out, and he's being snubbed on the floor. 

He's sworn in. Flashing his questionable hand signals and affiliations publically.

Now they want him out. 

The thing is, the same party raging and gasping on his background, clutching their pearls in horror, are actually to blame for him being there.

When you abolish those very same safeguards like ethics committees and supposed voter protections, to protect their interests and faults from scrutiny, people like him get validation by voters, waltz right in through those same doors, are sworn in and take a seat. He wasn't hiding it, no one bothered to check. He was actually vocally open about it. 

Now they want him to resign and he is dictating the terms. His voters. You want him out, convince all 174,000 of them he needs to go. 

And as long as his did not lie about his campaign promises and use those lies to get elected, again, there is nothing that they can really do unless they approach his voter base. 

So. What he has really done is a favor. He has grossly exposed his party and used their nearsighted abolishment of political safeguards to his advantage and bested them at their own game. He's not the biggest rat in the room, he's the smartest. He was elected, got all the way to DC on a background carpet of lies, took his seat and will receive all the perks, pay and privileges of his position. 

Thing is, he's not the first. He just played the long game by their rules to his advantage and won."

brain_overclocked,">A controversial donor, who along with his apparent domestic partner gave a combined $34,500 to Santos, is **Andrew Intrater**, the CEO of a company which once had ties to a sanctioned Russian oligarch Intrater is the CEO of Sparrow Capital — an investment firm formerly known as Columbus Nova. Prior to the imposition of sanctions on the oligarch in 2018, it was listed in regulatory filings as an affiliate of Viktor Vekselberg's Renova Group, an aluminum, energy and telecom conglomerate. Intrater, who is Vekselberg's cousin, also served as a former director of Renova, according to a 2010 filing.  
...  
Intrater isn't the only prolific supporter of Trump-aligned Republican causes to make large donations to Santos. **Cheng Gao**, an immigrant from China with a Trump Tower apartment who also attended the former president's 2017 inauguration, gave $11,200 to Santos for his 2022 campaign. Gao could not be reached for comment. CBS News has not learned how either Intrater or Gao came to be Santos supporters.

>Meanwhile, **Rocco Oppedisano's** family was visibly involved with Santos's campaign. Reportedly an Italian national, the 54-year-old, donated $500 to a victory committee benefiting Santos' campaign in September according to FEC records. That donation to the son of Brazilian immigrants who campaigned as tough on immigration, drew attention after the Daily Beast reported that Oppedisano had pleaded guilty to smuggling undocumented migrants into the U.S. in 2019. A further review of Oppedisano's court records show his criminal record also includes convictions for grand larceny, DWIs, and possession of ammunition by a convicted felon.  
...  
Members of Oppedisano's family also donated to Santos's campaign. His brother and niece, who run an Italian restaurant in Queens called Il Bacco, were appointed to Santos' Small Business coalition.

>Brett Kappel, an attorney with Harmon Curran, told CBS News that accepting donations from foreign nationals who are not legal residents of the U.S. is a crime under the Federal Election Campaign Act. "

DrB00,"So... now that it's all found out he's going to be forced to resign and apologize for taking corrupt money, and then spend a few years in jail? Right?"
cromethus,"Santos just bugs the crap out of me.

Parties are supposed to vet their candidates. The voter places faith in the party that the ground work has been done so they can focus on the candidate as a politician rather than a person.

This is why the 'October Surprise' used to be a big deal -  it not only embarrassed the candidate but proved that the party failed in their duty as well. When it came out candidates generally took a decent hit and it echoed strongly down ballot because the people's faith in the party was moved, if not shaken.

But the Republican Party doesn't care anymore. They won't remove Santos because doing so would mean admitting the party failed. Admitting failure, to them at least, is *much* worse than letting the stain simply stay and pretending like it was part of their outfit all along.

""It's a feature not a bug"" is their new motto. There is no wrongdoing unless they admit there is. And even when you can get them to admit it their response is 'so what'?

They are the emperor with no clothes. They think that as long as they keep pretending it won't matter. And they've trained Republican voters that it doesn't matter either.

But it does matter. The Republican Party is fiddling while their house burns around them, all content to pretend the heat is just so comfortable. Their pretending won't stop the house from collapsing though, and it won't spare the people who will burn along the way."
