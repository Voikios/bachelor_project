PuffZA,"I just enjoying playing Tarkov with the boys, games not the best state yes... But won't stop me from having fun, and if I'm not having fun I move onto the next game till the next wipe"
xoull,I am enjoying it. Is the game in a good state? Def not...
SleazyHermit,"Being able to have fun while game being in a really bad state is very possible.

I'm playing the game, for now still, even though the audio is absolutely killing me and I'm getting super frustrated.

&#x200B;

I'm still having fun a lot of the time though. But it could be better, much better."
MatrixBunny,"My friends do not use the subreddit, but hate the state the game has been for years."
sveniboych3,Im largly silent and I hate it. I really wanna see some good changes from bsg
starlot_,"I wanted to enjoy this wipe, but techincal side of tarkov makes it impossible for me"
Krempiz,"Tell me which game the elite/hard core player base is having fun and not constantly complaining? 

Casuals have the most fun always"
spanky_rockets,I’m enjoying this wipe all except for the massive performance decrease across all maps.
thelameghost,"This is the wipe where it finally clicked for me. I finally manage to survive nearly all encounters with scavs, and about 50% of pmc encounters, whether by winning the fight or disengaging after fucking him up and deciding finishing the kill isnt worth the risk. This is my fourth wipe, and I couldn't be happier"
Himolaskihomer,No we aren't
Rasputin0P,Im silent.. Because I could tell the wipe wouldnt be worth playing from the start lmfao.
mmpa78,And they should stay silent. Let the shit devs hear how fkn bad the game is right now so MAYBE they'll actually do a thing or two to fix it.
QuietSuch2832,"I really take the positive, laid back side in many situations. That being said, Tarkov has been infuriating sometimes this wipe. RNG royally screwed me on a lot of the beginning quests. After burning out last wipe trying to finish my boss kill quests when they literally would not spawn for me, getting the worst luck possible when rushing the Salewa/iskra/flash drive spawns this wipe really irked me. I hate that the game is gated in such a way just to artificially slow you down. My first wipe (2 wipes back) it didn't bother me at all. Then last wipe wasn't too bad because it all felt sort of new but it was definitely more annoying than the first time. This time was a complete chore. I like questing, I like seeing the progression. But when you get hard stuck it goes from enjoyable to feeling like you're wasting time better spent elsewhere. That being said, I was beginning to have fun once I got past those dumb quests..

Then I took a 4-5 day break and came back on friday. I was suddenly getting head eyesed every time I died. Quickly. When I was busy with work stuff and decided to sit in a bush to finish an annoying shoreline quest, people ran up to my random bush in the pitch black darkness and shot me, usually in the eyes or once 3 times square in the stomach so as not to hurt my armor or helmet. 3 raids back to back.

Then on factory a guy slow walked at me with his knife out while I unloaded 8 Magnum buck shells square in his chest.

There's more, but I knew something was up and seeing the subreddit today confirmed it for me. I don't cry cheater often, but they aren't even trying to hide it.

I guess the point I'm making is that as someone with quite a bit of real life responsibility I was pretty excited to have my firet wipe where I could push said responsibilities off a bit and really get into it. Then Tarkov happened and honestly I came out liking the game less than I had before. I'm at about 1200 hours over 2 1/2 wipes and I wouldn't say I'm burnt out.. just starting to see the flaws. I still like Tarkov and I still have fun sometimes but to me playing a game should be fun at least MOST of the time, not sometimes.

Sorry for the rant, TLDR: I had a good amount of free time for the first time ever for a fresh wipe and came in with high hopes. Disappointed thus far."
Tark001,All the issues would be acceptable short term if the cheating wasnt the worst its ever been.
GuidoMista2001,"People want a better product nothing wrong with that, make a lowsodiumtarkov if there isn't one."
IllState5161,"Enjoy the wipe in silence then while we try and make BSG actually do something to fix their shit.  


We've been dealing with the same issues for years now. We don't care if you're enjoying the game, do what you want, but we're done tolerating janky shit that should of been fixed years ago."
SlaveNumber23,"Doesn't mean the game should be free of criticism, and like 90% of the criticism I see on this subreddit is about genuine valid issues that should be addressed, not just ""negativity"". What is the point of a post like this?"
DrMalware,"This post is kind of like the people who say cheating isn't a problem and then people post proof of all the cheating. Whenever people complain about something legitimate whether it is cheating, or recoil, or servers (which are valid complaints to have) some people have to post that BSG is amazing and thank them for all the hard work and how wonderful and fun the game is."
one-753,"you can enjoy the wipe and still point cheaters and bugs, it's not 2 different side lmao"
Wunon,"I told you, 2 days after someone makes a post giving valid complaints there's always a whiteknight with the post of ""burrr me have fun, game have no problem, complainers have skill issue"".

People can still enjoy the game and complain, it's called wanting problems fixed while not turning a blind-eye and sucking BSG's balls."
P0werEdge,ok
Potatooooes_123,"People playing this game are simply addicted. Once you find another game, you understand how tarkov isnt worth your time and definitely not the 100$"
GoobyPlsBro,"Yeah, people can still have fun. I have been killed a few times by cheaters this wipe, but I still enjoy it overall. Just wish BSG would do a ban wave after another, the front page is not supposed to look like a Cheater Highlights page."
Solaratov,"Good for you. Just because you read negativity on the reddit though doesn't mean that those people are wrong. You should not feel compelled to ""fit in"" with the general opinion of the sub, and I think this is something that a lot of people don't realize.

They see negativity on the sub and think that this somehow challenges the enjoyment that they personally are having. That the experiences of others somehow contradicts(rather than differs from) their own experience and so they feel the need to defend their experience from this perceived attack."
_Chambs_,"And?

If they are happy with a shitty product, it's not our problem.

If you don't complain, nothing will improve."
Automatic-Diamond256,"What if I told you that, you can like something and be equally or more critic about it."
Tehslasher,"My god these posts are so low effort.

&#x200B;

This just in: People have varying opinions. 

&#x200B;

People enjoy the wipe while others aren't? What a fantastic eye opening post."
nlewis4,This subreddit is literally the worst thing about the game
unbelievablymoist,"Feel this. 

Me and my buddies are having fun, we’re casuals so the trader ammo nerf and all that jazz I’ve seen 400 posts of today isn’t the biggest deal in the world."
cerealOverdrive,I just started playing and have lost all my gear. Fun game though
acaerus,"And just as many people silently uninstalled tarkov or silently suffer from ass burn without posting it here, see my point?"
Sqweeg,"Sincerly I am, about to get lvl 20, 65% survival rate, first wipe since 2016 that I'm playing with a really good rig (allowing me to play at 140 fps 1440p everywhere except lighthouse and streets), it's fun.

Fortunately I did the pocket watch and extorsionist before the 1/1 key change, and all the others boring quests were done first try everytime. (Like chimist part 3 and 4, delivery from the past, etc)

I'm really enjoying those quest rework (still wondering what they were talking about when they said items weren't in the same place than before?), but sometimes I feel like it's a bit... Empty ?

New stims are a bit useless, weapon enhancement is impossible to find and streets is barely playable even with a high end rig."
Pierr0x,"I'm enjoying this wipe. Not because of the wipe itself, but because I could install Tarkov SP and play the last version in solo. Fuck this buggy mess, I'll go back online when they get their shit together."
BigLoad96,You say anything that goes against the circlejerk and you get downvoted and attacked. Makes sense to stay silent.
allleoal,People go to reddit when they want to complain and circlejerk. People actually enjoying the game are playing it and living their lives.
Dlitosh,Thats not true
puddleofaids-,First wipe and man there really is nothing like this game. Ive always wanted the feeling of fearing death in an fps and everything about it is just up my alley. The stuff people complain about are justified tho in my opinion. Like 90 percent of my friends cant even play streets and the hacking(specially if youre in asia) is outta control.

Dirtydantheman95,"Yeah if your still regularly dying to scavs your doing something wrong, mainly how your moving. Can’t let scavs see you in open areas before you see them. It’s a death sentence unless you have good aim"
HappiwahOG,"We are 6 people playing.
We all have fun.

People cry about everything it’s insane.
Most of thé player are just bad, and blâme thé game…"
Professional-Menu-95,"Im glad your bar is so low, if you dont want to realize it, just stay off of social media surrounding this game lol"
huzzaah,"Reddit in general is really really bad about becoming echo chambers for things people don't like, this sub in particular is terrible for it.

It's nice to see a positive post about a game I enjoy in the subreddit ostensibly for people to discuss the game they enjoy."
CompetitiveSpread839,"I’m enjoying this wipe other than the fact that my friend & I are constantly under 500k roubles when we’re normally sitting at a couple million at this point. I don’t know what changed, but making money is definitely tougher for whatever reason.
I haven’t figured out exactly what or why it’s harder."
legalizeweednotgreed,"Having fun solo and with the boys. Cheaters suck, report if sus. Streets need optimisation, they know. I'm skipping the streets quests atm. Fights there are so out of sync"
Kvicken94,Me and my buddy enjoy it very much. It's just a bit frustrating sometimes that I wish was fixed forever ago.
RickRate,Besides the bugs i do enjoy the wipe
zemzy10,True. I hate the performance but man i'm sucked right back in. Just doing better every wipe. Honestly also don't encounter too many cheaters. Everyone says they are rampant but my low lvl ratty ass doesn't really come across any of them right now. It was way worse last wipe for me
kona1160,"Good for them, I'm not one if them"
LordAdler,Im noz Just silently enjoying this wipe like every other because it is always a new challenge that I welcome. I also kill a lot of dudes silent.
Dog_Backwards_is_God,"im enjoying it :)
obv there are painful moments but thata just tarky things"
Vjekov88,"I like the game, it's frustrating sometimes. It's my first wipe. Still have trouble placing shots effectively, enemy pmcs always get me faster than I get them....."
Mr_Fluxstone,"So far besides some funky net code issues / unstable servers I haven't encountered too many problems and wipe so far is still interesting.  
Didn't pvp too much until now so I cannot say anything about cheaters.  
If shit really hits the fan hard I might look into ""playing single player"" until the issues are resolved."
JiffTheJester,"I’m having a blast, I just wish streets ran better, and they actually changed the quests. It’s getting so old doing the same opening tasks for 10 wipes"
CUCKSTER0101,How dare you.
djhazard123,"I’m loving this wipe. It’s the first time In 4 wipes Tarkov has finally clicked for me. 54% SR. Hit level 16 on the first 10 days. Normally takes me all wipe to hit 25. 

Sure it has its issues but there’s nothing out there like it so I just enjoy it for what it is."
Nomu19,"Im having such a good time grinding my way to max traders. People who mald about desync and cheaters need to realize that these things are never gonna change. If you cant cope with it you need to stop playing now and save your sanity, for real."
rapilstilskin,I'm having fun.
uSer_gnomes,"It’s always the manifesto that starts with “I have 3500 hours”.

It’s like dude, you’ve got your money’s worth off your one time purchase. Play something else."
CumManOfficial,"Wipe after wipe they add new frivolous things that come along with a full suite of game-ruining technical issues. I just wish for once they would take the time to stop making stupid shit like new guns, ammo, maps, and clothing, and actually do something beneficial like increasing game stability. 

BSG can’t seem to do anything without fucking something else up in the process, it feels like the game is held together by popsicle sticks and string. If they took the time to just work on the overall interconnected stability of the games different systems before just jamming new shit into the mix it would be a completely different story"
JunniorDS,I'm enjoying but IA and audio are dog shit
,"this, 1000%"
mach_z3ro_x,"I feel like this is the first in 4 or so wiped where things have really clicked for me. Most of my gear fear is gone, still dealing w/ FOMO but that’s half the fun. Engagements are better and I’m performing better overall. Sure there are issues, but that’s part of the experience"
Kingsayz,"I do enjoy it but the game needs fixing. I have been doing scav runs on interchange, and the audio is do fucked up i had literally no idea what's going on"
KelloPudgerro,"i wish i could, but 15min+ matching and bad performance just made me uninstall"
Anom8675309,not the people who want to walk silently
Special_Function,"You can enjoy some aspects of the game and hate others. Unfortunately this game in its current state is just insanely filled with stuff that grinds your gears no matter how much you enjoy the other half of the good stuff. 
I don’t necessarily think there’s a silent majority who enjoy the game that don’t vocalize it. I think that’s a bit of copium because every day there’s at least five posts like this saying how this is the best wipe to date minus whatever current problem plagues said wipe. It’s easier to complain about the shitty parts of this game because we share common shitty experiences. That should say something interpret it however you want to. 

Pretty much every person who plays Tarkov has heard about it through word of mouth. Most of us have positive things to say about the game, it’s concepts, and mechanics. But we all have to acknowledge that the state of optimization and bug fixes for the last three years suck. pretending like they don’t because there’s like one or two new things and a new partially complete map that barely runs for mid end pc’s should be the normal because “it’s a beta.” With no real roadmap Tarkov is pretty much loosely winging it like I did a lot of college work. 

There needs to be more structure into where BSG dedicates resources to improve the game. Being a beta project is more than adding content and fixing it later because yeah you can do that but The point of a beta is to add features and polish it for a full release. Not to keep it in limbo for half a decade while milking the game like it’s fully released. 

Don’t get me wrong either I played DayZ from the mod up until stand alone to a little bit this day. believe it or not the guys at Bohemia fucking hunkered down for years. Even remaking the entire game engine for SA DayZ to be fully launched to an acceptable standard. So I know it’s possible a team who believes in their game will make it right. But that’s not gonna happen without the right leadership and direction at BSG."
buttermilkbilly,"Thanks for this. Thousands of silent people are busy enjoying the game, rather than on Reddit posting bitchy dissertations about the game."
Jrmuscle,Can confirm. I've been having a blast this wipe when I'm not on reddit or playing Snoreline
DrXyron,Reddit is only negative but the game is not without issues. The peekers advantage/desync is much more significant this wipe than previous 3-4. I’m seeing some quite shit servers in terms of packet loss. And the audio. If BSG addresses those in a month then it is one of the better wipes.
T-unitz,No they aren’t lol.
prysey,"Yeah a lot of butthurt people, can't expect to have everything for a mere 30 quid"
Tommypaura,"Thanks, we all are enjoying the game... But we  know things should be better..."
Meetoihinn,I'm lvl 29 about 100 raids having fun. Only seen 1 hacker so far. 65% survival rate.
milkytrizzle93,"I would agree. This morning was a bit of an anomaly, plagued with hard crashes and stutters which evoked the rage of Cerberus in me. A cup of tea settled me down though and now I'm ready to jump back in for a few hours"
LacunaeInside,I havent found a single cheater
milkytrizzle93,"I'm also waiting on Starfield launching, which will (as all BGS games) be buggy as hell. I'll still sink 5000 hours into that game. I did the same with Skyrim and I played that on PS3 when it first launched, BGS had no clue how to develop for CELL architecture which resulted in every single object interacted with being recorded and archived, leading to a whopping 1fps once the save file reached 13MB. You haven't seen bad game development unless you seen that. Playstation didn't get any DLC until the GOTY edition released fs"
KyleGuap,"Yeah the game is dope.  Haven’t played since about June 2021 when I was level 55.  Still remember everything.  Besides the horrendous audio and the fact that you gotta run away from 7.62 ps scavs I’m doing all right.  The goons are total fucking bullshit though.  I died to them like 5 times already.  Rather die to a player, it just feels like you get cheated when you run into them"
SgtStorelvmo,I've been loving the wipe so far but i despise how negative and entitled the fanbase is becomming so i stat qway from 90% of reddit posts complaining
Wurmitz,Yeah and there was gonna be a red wave of “silent majority” trump/gop voters in the US elections this year. 🙄
Raiju_Lorakatse,"My survival rate ( Roughly 30% ) is pretty shit. I am level 21 right now which is considering how old this wipe is quite a lot FOR ME so far. Currently often hard fucked in PVP.

Overall i quite like the wipe so far. I kinda wish there would have been a few more adjustments to the gameplay ( buff initial recoil and nerf continuos ).

I quite struggle to find a lot of things ( Certain materials for the hideout, freaking flash drives ).

And on top of that I quite struggle with progress at this point. I have quests i never had before, do a lot of things first time now and then geting fucked by UMP spamming giachads is quite annoying.

But overall i still quite like the wipe so far aside from once more full auto spamming being top tier meta."
ApeOfDiamondz,"I would think, most players who enjoy, are infact new players, or players who have played 2 or 3 wipes."
Conserliberaltarian,"I'm having a lot of fun, but I'm discouraged by the state of the game currently. Not by the things that have been changed, but by the things that haven't."
Virtual_Ad_5037,I have a ball when I play. Have for the last few years.
LukaCola,"Is this the ""silent majority"" argument in its natural state? 

Don't delude yourself like that my friend."
Megatroon90,"If you just learn to see the positive in life, you stop complaining and start feeling happier. Same goes in games. Why waste energy on negative stuff when you can choose to focus on the positive things instead. People are just miserable with their life so complaining on something insignificant as a game makes them feel better for a short time."
firebolt_wt,"A lot of silent ppl are also hating the wipe, smartass.

And a lot of loudmouths like you feel it's necessary to declare they're enjoying the wipe, too. You're not special."
MazziGT420,Only braindead noobs that dont respect their time enough are having fun at this game right now. Sorry to bring it to you.
linkindispute,You enjoy getting stomped by cheaters? weird kink.
TehMangler,I'm enjoying it. My friend and I are having a good time. It is our 2nd wipe together. My third. It's been fun to see hise and my improvements from last wipe.
Weirdo7071,"I don't care that scavs are 1shot machines, but I really hate that I can run warzone2 at 144fps at default settings and can't play tarkov smoothly.
Tarkov needs optimization and they really need to work their audio.
Everything else is about fine."
whensmahvelFGC,"The game is definitely NOT getting better. Streets is a great addition, as are the new weapons, but there's so many other changes that overshadow those things that I can't say the game has been steadily improving since I really started playing in 2019.

I'm still having fun, mostly because I'm playing with friends, but I don't know if I have another wipe in me if the game stays on this net negative downward trend. The audio and cheating problems are a big one but beyond that nerfs to overall progress, loot being nerfed on our favorite maps (Interchange has gone from my personal favorite map to my most hated this wipe), recoil changes all add up to me questioning whether or not I'm committed enough to play through maxing traders. Pushing Kappa is basically out of reach for me now - I've done it twice but that was before it was behind level 55 and with fewer quests than there are now.

The thing is, no other game provides the highs that Tarkov does. With all the issues I'd jump ship to the first game that can create that same feeling (The Cycle/DMZ/etc just don't do it), but I'd definitely rather see Tarkov succeed. When tarkov is at its best its a truly great game"
Kussypat,They just gotta do something about the sound. It's getting kinda insufferable.
Significant_Egg_9786,"Honestly,  I've really been enjoying this wipe when I play in the mornings. After 4 to 5pm in my time zone, seems the amount of hackers sky rockets and the servers glitch out. I have more fun on dog shit kits than I do my good kits. Nothing like getting killed by naked guys who can't take damage when you've spent 300-400k on a kit. Had it happen 3 times last night. Idk how cheating is so prolific and then you play at another time and it's like they're non-existent..."
skipperskippy,you guys are all wrong
Leonaab4,"To break my silence.. this wipe, as Nikita said, is damage to my brain. Some maps are literally unplayable. Especially maps with tasks. Sometimes I record how I die and after watching it several times I can't explain it. Apparently everyone is better than me. And yes I just died with good loot and quest items. (again) Somehow I still open the game over and over again."
PrinceOfRye,Why does it seem like there’s waaay less VOIP interaction than last wipe?
eluganzor,"My squad is still playing, all of us having a good time. We’ve been putting off playing Streets due to performance though"
Ajt0ny,"Yes. You can recognise all the flaws and still enjoy it. At the end of the day, it's just another game among millions of other games. If you had enough or you can't enjoy it anymore, go play something else. Personally I really like solo night raids, that's what keeps me here. The atmosphere is great, and fights happen more rarely, BUT if it happens, it's much more tense. I love it! Oh, and cultists!

I'm going to exaggerate, but I feel like the many ranting players about how bad the game is act like the game is their whole personality, like they can't even play anything else after 4 quadrillion hours into the game. Like this is their life. Yes, it's a niche game and it sratches an itch that maybe no other game can scratch that well, but if you can't get past it and can't manage your itchy frustrations, maybe it's not the game's fault. Many criticisms are valid, but if all you do is complain..."
MZFN,Best wipe since 3 wipes i think
nriojas,"Am I having fun this wipe? Naw. Am I making posts about it so it can fall on deaf ears? Naw. 

Streets should be enough of an example of the state of this game right now. Rubber banding, severe frame drops, and it literally fucks with our discord when we play it. I do not know how it’s possible, but it does."
proxzerk,"So far, I am enjoying this wipe! 

* Have I had a few sus kills deaths, sure? 
* Have I seen the rampant cheating, no?
* Overall I've had a lot of fun and success, maybe my low and slow playstyle or the fact that I am not geared to the tits with pockets full of loot. Maybe it's only playing on USE or something like that. dunno

I did not get many hours logged in this weekend, but I can state that if the cheating is as bad as reported yesterday and the majority of my games get impacted, my tune may change and I will likely move on for a bit, but love the game and have enjoyed this wipe. Even with its Beta Test vibe."
YoungBagSlapper,"Damn I like just started playing before .13 and got super into the idea of the game, literally just wanted to try streets and no new changes would’ve had a blast. Instead we got this"
fannypack666,"There are 100% problems with this wipe (my main gripe being audio) but it's been my most fun wipe yet. I play solo and I've enjoyed 99% of my raids. I understand the frustrations, but it's allowed me to play in a different style than usual."
SoftwareFormer5922,"Honestly the game does need some work but I have always enjoyed it. I'm just thankful that the developers are trying to achieve to make it better. Everyone just seems impatient or ill, but still continues to play."
vsemohouci,"During first 19 levels of play, we played 80% customs and 10% woods/shoreline, no problems, picking bolts and nuts, easy game gg

Then we started running Interchange, Lighhouse and labs.... Boyyyyy game is unplayable for us, flying hackers and blatant hackers everywhere :( 

So the first part WAS fun, second part and trying to push high level loot areas = later quests is disaster.

(Czechia - central EU)."
Harrysaches69,I’m out here clapping cheeks with the Kedr.
ReptileTheSnake,Yes
CanadaSoonFree,Yep this subs like 1-5% of the player base.
weaveryo,I’m absolutely having a blast. All my friends are back on after barely playing for two wipes.
Walks_On_Fire,"I am really enjoying myself honestly. To be fair though I did only purchase the game Friday night, so I really don't have a frame of reference for anything before 😅"
radelrym,First wipe back in about 3 and im having a blast so far
Scootyclaws,My group of friends and I are absolutely loving it. Every minute.
throwaway_733773,Assuming that you speak for all the silent people is quite a juvenile way to think. Speak for yourself cus you never know what someone else is thinking.
igerko,I'm angry as f... Every Shoreline is full of cheaters.
xMYTHIKx,"I have 1200 hours in this game and have reached Kappa twice. I haven't played in a few wipes, but getting back into it this wipe has been fun as hell!

It's just a game, it's supposed to be fun. Get used to wacky server nonsense, bullshit scavs, ridiculous grind, whatever - that's Tarkov. 🤷‍♂️"
AM_Patriot,"I love this game. 
Play with several incredibly negative people, though, which hurts the experience sometimes.
I think their extreme negativity makes me realize it's really not that bad.
Yes, there are known issues in the game, and everyone knows that walking into raid. We are all on the same playing field."
Direct-Nectarine-946,I enjoy it... So much ppl paying for carry that wil need to open carry company soon :)
Whole_Ad5154,1 pmc kill a night is all it takes. I suck ass so just killing one mf is all I need to be satisfied. Today was my determining if I was done with this game. Nikita must have noticed because I managed 4 pmc kills.
daddytodoroki,This is my 3rd wipe and I've only played for about a week maybe and have gotten to level 24 which is what I was at mid way through last wipe within a week
pthumerianhollownull,Yes
Grainger407,I’m having a great time this wipe. Probably fastest I’ve gotten to 26. I hope I don’t get burnt out. Usually don’t progress past 35-40. However the ammo and scope change was a kick in the nuts
billnfill,"This game is lit, the adrenaline rush man. Not many games have besides dark and darker. Oof how I miss hat game."
TehMasterSword,I'm sure there are dozens of you
VibinMan,Well. Yea. If it’s being enjoyed why would they come to Reddit? It’s essentially where people go to complain when it comes to a lot of stuff.
Fuzzy_Concentrate463,"    Maybe I’m just lucky, but I’ve been having a great time playing. I haven’t come across any cheating that I noticed. When I die it just seems I was outplayed or ran up on someone who was hiding. I had directional audio problems but once I turned off Sonar on my Steelseries headphones it completely seems fine now. Granted I’m only level 15 so there’s time for that to change."
not_James_C,"damn right...

For those who don't understand, no explanation is possible.

For those who understand, no explanation is necessary.

cheers mercenary!"
heyitzeaston,Not sure if its life for me or whatever but I played for like 2 days and called it quits on this wipe.
EpicRaginAsian,"Yeah, this is the most I've enjoyed tarkov, I think its partly to due to the fact that I got a PC upgrade so I dont lag or stutter anymore, but overall enjoying it a lot. Still bothered by a lot of issues though (Queue times, visibility, etc)"
PigasusGaming,"I mean I'm both having fun with the wipe because it's Tarkov, but also hating that the game is in the worst state it's been in for a while (potentially ever, tho I'm not a super longterm vet so I'm sure there have been worse patches in the past)"
thebananuhman,"Outside of some of the new bugs, and streets being basically unplayable for most, I find it just as fun as I did before the wipe. 

I also have only been playing for qbfew months too, so maybe a lot of it is burnout from playing for so many wipes?"
Agitated-Ad-6196,Very much enjoying this wipe. Yes it's obviously bugging and there's issues wmbut what game doesn't. Currently level 41 and really loving this wipe
InfamousTrust424,"I've been playing since 2019, skipped a wipe or two.
This is the most fun I've had in a good while. Love streets. Audio is a MAJOR issue for me but I'm still loving the game rn"
Twenty-Three23,"I'm having the most fun I've had playing video games in a long time. Third wipe for me. Ya I've been killed by a couple cheaters and it's frustrating. But, the times with the boys are priceless."
Tsarbomb,Me and some buds are still having fun and getting into good fights. However we all acknowledge the game is in the worst state it has ever been.
Spacezone229,I'm enjoying this wipe.  However it is a shitshow.
SaSLazarus,"Apart from the Sound, FPS issues on streets, and Recoil, I haven't had any major issues.

Had one player scav with ESP kill me through tree, but apart from that not had any other cheaters."
_papaya1_,Lots of issues with the game but still loving this wipe. I haven’t run into any cheaters yet.
bountyman347,75% of the player base can’t play the new map. All maps are laggy. Cheaters are everywhere. I’m having fun but like I’m not happy with what they’re doing.
ohwhofuckincares,"Had no problem getting to level 40 last wipe and mid 30s the wipe before that. 

This wipe i can’t walk through customs without getting headshot by a scav with 7mm from 100 fucking meters away.

Can’t move past power station on shoreline without getting 1 shot by the snipers on the roof. Once they see you the first time, they never lose sight no matter what cover/concealment you use to move. 

Can’t even fucking load into lighthouse with decent frames even after dumping my graphics down. 

Audio is something else entirely. 

Scav spawns are an absolute joke. Multiple times i, or someone on my team, have died to a scav spawning 3 feet in front or behind us and blasting us with a shot gun. 

Sure, there may be people enjoying individual raids but as a whole, this is the worst state the game has been in since it released."
Abject_Bodybuilder_7,This is the wipe I stopped playing the game
DingusImpudicus,"The game can be very frustrating at times, people come here to vent."
HoldThePao,Wouldn’t call it enjoying…. More like there isn’t anything else to play or do right now lol
hum_hum_hum,Must be all the silent hackers shooting me head eyes
Shmexie_TTV,"I am having a blast, and I love Streets so much.
I feel sorry for people who can’t run it though, I can’t play it with some of my friends unfortunately"
LawGamingTV,"hellp, I am one of them, close to 2000 hours and so far this is the best wipe but that's might also be because when tarkov wipes I play exclusively tarkov and only tarkov for at least 2 months."
LoadinDirt,Played for a couple hours yesterday. Died twice on interchange to a flood of p scavs? Then had a great time on woods and customs
supermonkeyball64,"I have never played with more 4-5 man groups in my life. The chaos is amazingly fun and hilarious, and mix that in with newbies, and we got chaotic shooting everybody sometimes. It's been hella fun despite any overall issues that may be at hand. No other game can produce these moments."
Alyosiki,"As an average and casual player, I am straggle to progress through the quest, because soem cheaters prefire me almost every raid. Scav runs looking for game 13-15 min +  
Server connection is fo\*\*ing worst, so often packet loss and just red alerts on the screen( i have 250 mb internet, with good and stable connection quality)  
Idk how you can enjoy. Mb you are much casual than me ( it is my 2,5 wipe so far)"
smallbluetext,My only issue is the streets rubber banding and obviously audio in general. Otherwise I am having a blast diving for the first time in almost 2 years.
schlosoboso,"the game is fun despite what the devs are doing 

they're killing it best as they can- but they struck gold and that's hard to bury"
GodIsEmpty,Game mechanics are the best they have been...game working is the worst it has been. Streets is cool af but I have to restart my pc every raid to get a very choppy 60-70 fps at 1080p(not to mentionthe lag). before I got 100fps on all the maps.(80-90 lighthouse) now I get 70 or 80 and it's choppier.
sc0tt3h,"EFT has been great this wipe and I'm having a lot of fun. I'm currently level 23 on my standard account.

My main issues are currently the sound (I have binaural disabled), Streets rubber banding, and player Scavs spawning in at the start of raids. I'm very satisfied with my performance in the game. I did Interchange today and had around 130 fps. Streets is around 60-70 fps for me which is fine."
Gzalzi,"This wipe has massive problems in the form of bugs and the half-finished audio, but overall I'm liking it.

A *lot* of the complaints this wipe are coming from people who are really bad at this game, see: key and ammo complainers"
MrGhost94,I am for sure . Only level 11 but I'm not a streamer  I work full time . I'm almost back to 3 million have done great with the quests so far . Have actually won some pvp . I have a around 250 hours in game . This is my 4th wipe . Didn't play much until the end of last wipe .I'm really enjoying it. You really do need around 200 hours before you start to feel like you know what your doing
Fellow-Child-of-Atom,"I think most people complaining also enjoy the game.

People complain so much because they care. I am having a blast playing the game right now, that's exactly why encountering map hackers every fourth raid is so disappointing.

If I wouldn't enjoy Tarkov, I'd just say nothing and play Dota instead."
yaboyteedz,I'm having a great time
AdConfident7002,People on Reddit are negative!? No way!!
Z0EBZ,"I enjoy playing the game because, like a crack addict, no other game hits that niche as well as Tarkov. However, it needs a whole hell of a lot of fixes and BSG need to step their shit up. Just an inkling of communication that they are doing something for the audio, or any of the numerous issues with the game."
mrbawkbegawks,If you mean deaf.... Sure
Ryder123456789,I'd like to enjoy it but I keep getting booted out of games because I lost connection to the server.
AamJay,"And you know that  because of what? The 10 People i play Tarkov with, are pretty mad about this Wipe."
RuckrTN,People are being vocal about the issues with the game and its needed.
gladbmo,Imagine having fun in a GAME lmao
FastExchange0110,There's probably a lot of is who can't even get into a fuckin raid.
LittleTaryn,"Besides the audio, cheaters on lighthouse and fps performance this is pretty fun wipe."
Design-Gold,"Its your typical reddit circlejerk, people will post and scroll here all day and convince themselves the subreddit is where every player goes. Meanwhile the actual majority are simply playing the game"
StaticClingManXD,"Said it before but I'll say it again: sub reddits don't matter.

&#x200B;

It's an echo chamber of the gamer Karens...

&#x200B;

Tarkov is one of the worst because most people who play are ""newer"" players and are not/have not been following development... When new features or ideas come in that make the game ""harder"" and more grindy... People freak the fuck out and cry... Well these features/ideas aren't actually ""new"". They've been planned since 2016 ALPHA...

&#x200B;

The next fit/tantrum from the what I like to call ""fake"" Tarkov players will REEEEE about will be in-raid magazine loading animations. Think medical animations but for packing mags. This will slow down game play and require more preparation from players. Whether it be bringing in bigger mags or bigger rigs with more mags pre-loaded, etc. And making your shots count so you don't have to sit in a room healing yourself then packing mag simulator.

&#x200B;

This has been planned for years but once it hits people will lose their fucking minds just like tier 2 bleeding... Medical animations... Etc.

&#x200B;

Most of the people on this sub right now are ""fake"" Tarkov players as they are only here for the wipe freshness+drops... These new/bad players think they need to be here on wipe day and play when it's new to ""have a chance""... But will still find a reason to quit in a week or two. Same goes for twitch drop kids. They will be gone soon, already dwindling.

&#x200B;

This sub is but a fraction of the real playerbase. Most people don't care to whine about things that are Tarkov... That makes Tarkov the way it is... And why it's unique...

&#x200B;

Tarkov is niche... Well was meant to be niche. A lot of people playing it or trying to play it have no real idea what it's really about and seem to force themselves to play it... They heard about it or saw it on twitch so they get it... Then when Tarkov is 'Tarkov' they freak out and cry... The simple solution here is to understand the game wasn't meant for them and to find another game... But they don't. They are loud and proud and annoying lol."
GoTTi4200,I'm enjoying it more then hating it by a long shot. +1 to the enjoyer post!
fuckfuckfuck66,"True, but not everyone that has quit/has problems with this game posts here either"
labelkills6287,Our crew has been having a blast! Man is it hard to run 5 mans tho!
Bigtbedz,I started playing like 4 days ago. 29% survival rate and I'm having a blast
PaladinKinias,"""This wipe is fucking trash, BSG sucks, Tarkov is dead, game is unplayable.""

\*According to players level 35+ with over 100 hours played this wipe already\*

&#x200B;

Calm down and have fun with friends, imo..."
BannanaBoy321,"Fick this sub, I love this game and loved the changes and the update."
MajesticCat98,"Already put 100ish hours in this wipe, loving every second. Even though the cheaters are a little rough I don't care, just gear up and get ready next raid. Love this game and it's literally a digital form of crack/herion mixed together."
Levi31k,"I used to have fun, but with every wipe the situation is just worse and worse"
Snlfrd,Loving it and conned a friend into getting on and actually learning. He's now hooked so we both play solo if we can't play together. 2nd wipe and I'm just as hooked if not more. I like stretching things out and making it harder for ppl to get to endgame. I can only play a few hours a day if I even can play and I still maxed traders on my first wipe with a month or two to spare.
ConfusedPuddle,I'm loving this wipe so much omg
Xylo_42,"Probably the silent few, but I’m really enjoying this wipe so far. Met two others who I know consistently run raids with and we’ve all been having a pretty good time in it. Only one cheater so far and found them as a scav"
alexchristian2001,"I've been loving it, been playing solo mostly and it's been rough but doesn't mean it's unenjoyable - I think a lot of people just care too much"
BladedWill,"I enjoy playing solo and with friends this wipe. I feel like I know what I’m doing now compared to being 360 noscoped by the gigachad hiding at the end of any corridor in Reserve. This wipe definitely still has its moments I don’t enjoy (terrible audio, bad performance on streets, reserve being buggy as shit) but overall, I’m enjoying this one the most I think."
Evo114,I’m still having a blast this wipe despite all the issues!
godofthegrid,I check the subreddit just to see about changes that keep happening (e.g. m80 moved today) and when I come on it's just some weird internal war going on lol.
DisGruntledDraftsman,"5 years, haven't missed a wipe, currently lvl 23. I'm done. 

Good for those that enjoy the game but after seeing the degradation of this game over 5 years, I'm not interested anymore. I don't want another job. I don't want a game that punishes me more than rewards me. I don't want a game that cheaters are ignored, bugs get worse, mission stay the same, and friends quit playing after the first month. 

Like others have said, the highs no longer outweigh the lows. Even when they were few and far between, getting a win was great. Now it's work, harder go come by, and no longer enjoyable even when they do happen. Like Nakita said, Tarkov isn't supposed to be fun. Ok, it's their game but I'm not a masochist so I don't want a game that isn't fun. 

Good luck to those that continue but I no longer enjoy this game.  I wish I could go back in time and not buy Tarkov."
xeeses226,Been having the most fun this wipe so far. My stuttering is gone and I can actually play the game again. Only a week and a bit into wipe and im pushing lvl2 traders and just unlocked flea. I've been focusing much more on questing and just trying to survive instead of going for pvp and it's paying off.
TheRock3tBunny,"Im enjoying it. But also I dont try and grind it, im only a level 12 and I play when I can here and there. Also I have only ever come across 1 cheater in 2 wipes and that was on woods the other day, he asked me, ""are those selewas in your inventory found in raid?"" Obviously things need changed, but I still enjoy playing it"
BigShrekDaddy69,"For real this has been my best wipe compared to the last two and yet so many people are whining everywhere I go.

Just grow up and accept the game you are playing, or don't play it!"
Salt_Nature7392,I mean with all the problems this wipe introduced and reintroduced you wouldn’t imagine their first change to be removing any ammo that can actually kill things level 37 for m80? fuck you
ShakedownBlues,"I've been having a blast and have mostly sworn off solo play. I have much more fun with a squad.

Despite the issues with Streets, I fucking love the map, I love how big it is, I love how much there is to see and do, and I love the idea that this place is gonna be a motherfucking mad war zone when they finish it off.

I love the Aug, haven't tried the new SMG or UBGLs, I love the addition of the gym and the expansions for the shooting range. 

All in all, I'm happy with this new wipe, and I'm looking forward to what comes next."
DrFloppyTitties,"Minus playing for a few levels a few years ago before interchange was even a map, the first wipe I really played the game was 12.10 at the end of it. I skipped 12.12.30 for the most part because I felt that was the worst point tarkov has ever been in.

New map is fun and great. Performance on it is crap but I have a good rig so its not as bad. The memory leak makes the game unplayable after 5 or so raids though. Audio is horrible but I have hopes it'll be ""fixed"" soon.

New changes extend early game so I'm for it. I'm level 38 already with a near 80% survival rate over 200 raids. Taking last wipe off was probably the best thing for me because I am honestly loving the game at the moment. I am starting to hit burn out as all the quests are no longer find and return but more like do X on Y map with Z stipulation."
VindictiveVibe,"Yes, it's still a fun game overall, but I can completely agree with someone if they don't want to play this wipe. There are a few fundamental things for the game that have been botched, and any negativity towards them is justified. I just enjoy EFT overall, so it doesn't stop me entirely. It is frustrating though."
OscarPapa1,I am one of the silent people that is not really enjoying the wipe.
Dull_Masterpiece3490,"Longest my friends and I have played a wipe so far, probably having the most fun as well. Doesn’t mean we don’t complain about matching and performance issues every damn match though. You can do both and that’s okay too"
SilentReavus,"Well I'm glad for them and they have a lot more patience and tolerance than I

But as someone who lacks skill and relies on trying to sneak around it's now even worse than before. The game already didn't work well for that. Now it's just impossible unless you just don't move at all."
InertiaEnjoyer,"I'm loving it 

Level 20, 17mil stash value, 148 raids

Binaural off. Audio is really good EXCEPT for vertically. I have had no issues telling directions and everything seems louder

Streets is a fantastic map. I have no clue what causes the rubber banding but this map will be perfect once that is fixed. 

The quest changes are really underrated. You can complete all the starting quests on ANY maps you want. New players have only been able to run customs and woods before. 

Ammo scarcity is something they have needed for a long time. It is the only way to extend early wipe combat. 

I appreciate the single use keys. It has changed the flow of customs and gives you more reasons to go dorms in the early days. 

Overall, I'm loving this wipe for the slower burn."
nio151,why did you have to jinx it
Slaw239,"My best wipe so far, haven’t had a problem with scavs for the most part and actually thriving in this game for once 😂"
Complex_Teaching1872,The only major issue I find is the audio I've come to expect mediocre frame rates with tarkov so other than the audio this wipes great
Collguydev,nah
reed45678,"This wipe is great, people just stay mad and i just wait for their hearts to feel the stress they put on themselves"
dan_kb24,Enjoying the wipe despite sound being retarded. I just hope we aren’t waiting six months for some updates and fixes. Haven’t tried streets yet but I only played to around level 20 early in last wipe so the game is feeling a little fresh
Business-Piano-4940,Thats because we are actually playing and adapting to the changes and if we don't enjoy it we don't run to reddit like 12 year olds.
RedditCorbo,"I know the audio is whack but I have been able to pin-point players on Customs better than ever with the new audio.

Also I got all of my Gas Analyzers without having to craft or go to Interchange.

Wipe has been fine for me."
Joshohoho,"Its called feedback, it comes in different forms."
AnxiousMembership,"I play since 2017, never hogged the game, reached lvl 40 once and otherwise always just checked out the updates etc. Not a sick player and enjoyed the more stealthy gameplay, since I never had mates to play with. Sound was always my biggest issue and was so hyped, when I first saw the steam audio tech demos, imagining how this would be awesome with EFT, so the current patch is not the best in that regard. With that being said, i really enjoy the current patch. I didn‘t really play last wipe so yesterday was the first time, i observed a PMC from afar but of course he heard me. I didn‘t shoot tho because i just wasn’t sure if a could kill him from the distance. Some minutes later he approached me with the safety of a wall and it was the first time I really used VOIP. We decided to be friendly and help each other with the quests. It was a jolly good time. Plying from Europe, had worse wipes regarding cheaters (am lvl 16 and have yet to come across ragehackers or even questionable kills)."
-Shibdib-,You can enjoy a game while still realizing it's being mismanaged into the ground. They're not mutually exclusive.
Ghosthewolf,"yeah,im having good fun but the performance problems and the hackers r killing it a bit :( its not all that bad but its still crappy"
Asthenia031,lvl 38 having a great time can confirm :D
x994whtjg,agreed. its a grind but im playing mostly solo and learning so much about the game and my own gameplay.
Not-Boredaholic,"bought the game on release. played 30 mins, found it not fun. Just came back and it's actually fun. I'll be around until d4 releases just hopping in, looting and killing. tasks aren't a priority to me."
JackpotJosh7,"First wipe for me. This game is fun! Just killed my first PMC duo the other day. I don’t try and fight people, but usually do when we accidentally meet together."
Finger_Trapz,"I'm enjoying it, but I still have a lot of problems. Frankly the only reason I'm playing it is because my friends are, and I enjoy spending time with them. But there's still a ludicrous amount of issues with the game that I really can't forgive. I wouldn't even be on this wipe if it weren't for my friends."
Darkness1envoy,*silent noises*
gears-0f-war,I'm enjoying this wipe
Trick_College2491,I like it. I’m a new player. But I’ve just tried being friendly to people in the game and it has consistently gotten me killed.
Automatic-Ease4239,Minus the audio seeming worse/ harder to here directionally outside I'm enjoying this wipe. Scavs were straight up taking names and my lunch money the first week or so. Started on a 12 surv streak. Then subsequently had a double digit death streak lol
MacaroonSome225,"I came to say Amen brother, and now that I've read this thread, I'm here to say I'm sorry your thread turned out just like all the other cry-fests lol"

guberNailer,"As someone coming into it fresh, I’m enjoying it immensely. And also its pure pain but yeah."
brendo2013,"They literally killedd me and my duo's interest this morning with the ammo changes. We were trying to hang on, you know cause we had hope but this is unbearable its been the grindiest wipe ive had yet."
internetguy789,“A lot of people are enjoying their remaining time with their favorite parent in hospice”
Leytarkhan,You can enjoy a game and still hate the absolut state of it and the direction they are taking it...
terminallancedumbass,Took pretty much all last wipe off. This wipe there's nothing but issues but I'm also doing better than I ever have in the pvp department. Game has tons of fucking issues but it's still the most fun I have in a fps. Or really any game on the market.
Shooter503,"I'm enjoying pretty much everything except the cheaters. I've encountered too many this wipe, far more than previous wipes. Remove the cheaters and I really wouldn't have much to complain about."
Atreaia,How do you know?
_Thel_,"I’m personally enjoying it quite a lot. I got edge of darkness for Christmas, leveled up faster this wipe than I have in any before, I’ve done better against PMCs, I’m bolder and having a lot of fun"
becuzwhateverforever,"I’m waiting until I unlock the flea to really pass judgement. I’m getting the dust knocked off my ass by high level players using good ammo and armor, but I’m progression locked since I can’t find a lot of early game keys. Once I get the flea, I think I could fly to level 3 traders and start pushing fights."
TalonTitanBlue,"I enjoy the game sometimes, But that doesn't mean the game isn't in an atrocious fucking state. You can enjoy a game whilst still acknowledging its in the worst state its ever been in.

The state of the game in regards to a lot of issues isn't an opinion its an objective fact, Audio is fucked, anti cheat is fucked, optimization is fucked.

The only things that I would consider opinion based is balancing of scavs and traders : P"
The7Deadly,"So....

I've been playing this game since Alpha at times when people still couldn't stream it.

I can say with all honesty we made big jump with all fixes and upgrades but game is getting worse and worse with each wipe and your experience/gameplay style/options are being limited.Don't get me wrong I do slightly enjoy Tarkov but not for changes, it's more of ""stockholm syndrome"" than pure joy.

No I don't have problems with making money,

No I don't have problems with PvP ( Either i go in for people or I disengage if they are hardstuck camping and I'm not in mood to search whole resort for them)

No I don't have problem with leveling/questing. Somtimes it takes longer sometimes it takes shorter to reach max lvl traders, usually happens in first 2-3 weeks of wipe then it's slow ride to Kappa with PvP

Sometimes I do have issues killing bosses but they're just ""Fuck you mode"" or magical desync happens

I purely fucking hate how sound works in this game, worst of all games I've played with all changes happening 24/7 that does not bring positive results ( I think there was only 1 wipe and not even full when sound worked pretty decent then it got turned upside down AGAIN)

All Goods:

* Slightly improved FPS
* Unique experience?
* Decision making required to be victorious (lately I question this, simple camping works best)
* More guns (majority same crap)
* More quests to do
* More maps
* More RPG related skills (imo some of them are pretty useless unless maxed out)
* Satisfaction guaranteed when you wipe 4 man group camping in rooms on any map
* Voice chat (more shit talk interactions or sometimes godsent comms if u wanna avoid fight when you do that dumb quest)
* Maybe more?

All Bads:

* Restrictions to how many certain items I can pick. Can't even remember how many GPU's I couldn't pick when playing solo on stream and my viewers were like: KEKW 7 GPUS 1 RAID LOOK HE CANT PICK THEM ALL UP.
* Even more restrictions when it comes to dropping stuff. Me and my buddy used to throw keys for each other in case one of use died so we can use them for our quests. Can't wait for the day when I won't be able to drop my gun for buddy or ammo
* Visual recoil - atrocity, all bugs that happen in game, including 0 headbob and newest no zoom one would make this game 20x better. Waiting for promised slider to 0 on headbob
* Sound - Whoever is responsible for it has no clue what hes doing and it's showing for multiple years, same bugs. No they're not sound engine bugs, it's all about what Veritas/Pestily mentioned multiple times over the years and still no fix.
* RMT Combat - Ok so now I earn less, less with every wipe
* Barters - Overall good idea, bad execution, bad adjustments or 0 adjustments at all
* Global Stock Limits - Why? Why is that even here since we have limit on how much of what we can buy? Time to get rid of it, this is why we work for those trader levels.
* Crafting - Another good idea but bad execution, with majority limitations or time required for certain crafts they're clearly stupid and not worth even if it's for yourself (ammo especially)
* Daily Logs - You need to log in for daily or it's exp lost, need to log in daily or you have chance to lose that precious equipment if it comes back, fucking mobile game bro, everything requires you to daily log in (crafts especially)
* Hit reg - It got better but still scavs/players not registering hits which happens pretty often sucks.
* Hackers - Instead of getting less and less I honestly see more and more. Pure anti-cheat failure and engine choice here by the looks of it since devs are making more weird decisions that push RMT even harder with limits
* BOSSES - I thought we didn't want to go in direction of Division 2 and making them bullet sponges, but it's not only that. Headshots with 5.56 won't kill them, M80 or better caliber required for consistend headshots. Did I also mention, they like to laser beam you thruu pixel peeks? 0 tactical or being unique, it's either ""Fuck you, die"" or ""Spank me, take my gear""
* Cultists - Remember when we had cool mechanic at start with them? Surrounding you without making sounds, false shots, scare tactics to get that stab in? Yeah no more, apparently someone in BSG didn't like them being farmed so they threw that ""interesting idea"" into trash bin and made them same as bosses but without ""Take my gear please""
* Rules for Rogues/Raiders/Bosses - They don't play by same rules as players, leg shotting won't make them limp, they don't care about recoil (**most of the time as stated above, they just full auto laser beam with guns you wouldn't hit a barn on full auto mode**), They aimlock you, shoot you thruu walls, shoot while power sliding (perfect accuracy a lot times), don't care about weight limit and many more. Bring proper rules for them...
* Scav Mechanic vs Anti-camping - Where did it go? Didn't work perfectly at start but was fine when they kept pushing slowly onto positions you were camping for longer period of times if they had spawns nearby (especially on notorious PvP zones like: Resort, 3-story dorms and few others).
* Camping, camping, camping - All those changes above are just promoting this gameplay style more and more. Worst part is, at one point you will do the same because it's highly effective without any penalty if it's high traffic area (people will come 100%)
* PvP - It's most of the time dead, if you don't meet camping duo/trio/quattro then your opponents will just run away, sit in bush/room/whatever until YOU make sound because they don't need to hold corners as doesn't work because of desync... (pusher advantage a lot of times) But majority of times it's just who camps better and loses patience waiting first

&#x200B;

There's so much more to this and hopefully devs will fix majority of those problems which to some are minor and others major.

My question is: How much more grind can players actually withstand because we are getting to points of where it's getting masochistic at times

Still....Unless there is another game that is set either in Stalker universe that is same/close to Tarkov till then BSG is monopolist to such experience and will allways can do what they want and fix stuff when they want. I'm mostly talking about having certain things fixed only after quarter or two or maybe once a year."
FatDogTech,"I have enjoyed this wipe. I like that top tier items are regulated. I can still remember a few wipes ago where it was slick+top tier ammo for everyone. Those items are more of a treat now than a necessity. On the subject of complaining, I believe if you don’t have a solution to the problem then you have no right to complain. Most of the time the problems are over simplified in complaints. Fixing issues is usually a complicated process."
Due_Fly_5189,"Yknow, my game might crash a lot but I second this statement. I just love this game too goddamn much"
InvisibleZero420,"Lots of 1000+ hour players complaining and I can get it.  I have under 400 and so many maps and quests are still ""new"" to me so it feels fresh making the game more fun.  The game has so many problems though that once you get to the high hour count I can totally see how the game would become very stale."
HeinzFTW,Been having a lot of fun this wipe. Been blessed to have not seen a cheater yet by LVL 16
Esteozeka,"Yes, but I understand nearly everybody who's complaining, because this game is in an alpha/beta state for way too long and they can't fix basic shit, so I get the rage.    
Doesn't mean you can't have fun."
Xikky,"I'm silent and I just miss the old days of tarkov. When reserve came out that was probably the most fun I've ever had. After Idk how many wipes, Everytime I come back I just get so....bored and annoyed that I'm dealing with the same issues from 4 or so years ago."
ImCidal,"I have to restart my game every 2 raids, I'm getting shit on by scavs (or i was anyways pre nerf), I've lost like 10 class 5 armors and Ulachs to instant head eyes and shotguns and leg meta, streets is a horrible experience performance wise every other time I go there, I take L's left and right, but I still enjoy the hell out of the game. I'm level 30 and haven't touched another game since wipe lol. Love this game regardless of the problems, every game got problems, if they get fixed, that would he amazing, if they don't, I still feel I got my moneys worth."
SibirViking,Yes
TECHNOV1K1NG_tv,"I can be negative about aspects of the game but still have fun while I’m actually in a raid or playing with friends. The thing is most of the stuff everybody complains about is not really going to affect them on a raid-to-raid basis (obviously there are a few, like sound for example). Everything is magnified on Reddit because you are pooling from thousands of players, but that is not necessarily the experience for everybody.

 I mostly get annoyed when BSG moves the goal posts shortly after a wipe because no-lifers are able to gain access or finish stuff too fast. Like don’t punish 99% of the player base because 1% are playing FOR A LIVING and have 80 hours per week to pour into the game. Those people are going to finish everything in a month, regardless of how annoying or tedious BSG makes it."
extaz93,"You can enjoy this game while being angry at BSG and at the state of the game after 7 years of development, millions of dollars of profits (check their public results on google) and absurd decisions about recoil, loot nerfs or AI."
kidzen,I love the ammo nerfs. I never use the ammo anyways and i always got killed by them in previous wipes. Havent seen a single m80 this wipe and im lovin it
Tridgit,"agreed, i'm loving this wipe currently"
Bobert557,"This wipe has been great so far. And now the early game has been extended due to lack of high tier ammo. Drawing out fights. Gonna be fun. Immediate head taps from laser beam weapons isn't fun for either side. Neither is laser beams getting high pen ammo in you. Now its actually gonna be a fight, for longer into the wipe. Might be the best wipe yet imo. 

I just like pvp tho. I play this game as a better cod"
BigDadEnerdy,"Almost all of the people I used to play tarkov with played for about a week and they've all quit now. So sure, some streamers, no lifers, and people playing in discords probably are having a ball right now. But the vast majority of people that I personally know who all have 2k+ hours have quit."
TheDugong1,"No we’re not lol. I hereby speak for all those you haven’t said shit. Game state is trash, cheating is horrible, I couldn’t play for a solid week attempting to fix a BSOD caused only by playing Streets on a rtx3080, i7 9700k 32GB RAM and installed on a m.2. We’re just not bitching and instead silently waiting and dropping off till the games fixed."
Rimbaldo,"The six people I know who doesn't post on this sub have already quit this wipe and aren't planning to come back, so..."
RalphTheRapscallion,My fucking m80 rounds.
Sensitive_Regular388,You can enjoy a game and still have complaints. Someone makes this exact post every wipe to try and wholesome 100 some karma.
Sarahthegun,I got the game a day before the wipe. It's my first wipe and yea the game seems broken but it's pretty fuckin fun. Don't think I've ran into any hackers either but I have no clue.
SpaghettiIScheese,I enjoy this wipe. I'm just trying to get a fuck ton of gp-25s
EliteSoldier202,This is my favorite wipe and I’m having a ton of fun
Kboehm,"Imo, tarkov is the greatest game I've ever played, fight me."
fluffhead42O,"This is my first time playing the game ever. I've been so fking frustrated its unreal. Yet I've also had a lot of fun. Did the quest earlier where I had to get the docs from the directors office on customs and drop them off on factory without dying...took me two runs but my heart about beat out of my chest while planting it on factory. There are elements in the game that are SUPER rewarding and fun, then theres just ridiculous shit that makes me never wan to play again. I guess thats Tarkov for you thou"
Personalpotato,"Playing since day 1 with over 3k hours and yeah if people complaining in this reddit played back then they wouldn’t have touched the game a second time

That being said please fix the goddamn audio it’s my only problem rn"
Shawzus,Yep loving this wipe. People like to complain and think it should be like counter strike or valorant
Rhubarb724,I'm being honest when I say this is probably my least enjoyable wipe ever since I started playing in 2018
killking72,Haven't been posting because i'm not playing. Don't like this wipe and haven't.
kalloncemore,"Games definitely not where I would want it, if I even knew wtf I actually wanted to be honest.

That being said though I'm having a great time."
Izanagi666,"True, randomly played the first time with 2 mates that we knew from hunt showdown, they are lvl 7 and very new and we had a blast as a 4 man, its really fun to be the mega squad this time lol"
TakeInfinite,"The game is fun and I am enjoying it, doesn't mean I should shield it from criticism and much needed changes.

It's okay to have fun and still criticize it for it.

No shame in having fun, it's only shameful if you refuse to see the wrongs."
Zurrek7,Been scared of commenting on posts because I don’t want to be downvoted into oblivion
mxe363,"its been pretty fun so far, the scavs are scary (tho i have heard they've been nerfed) the loot has been wild, and they just made scav guns actually worth looting again. cant wait to try out the gun enchanting and once streets is all fixed up i know imma have a blast with that wipe. if you a loot goblin, its been a good wipe"
BadgerII,Reddit kills my enjoyment of the game more than playing the game ever will. This place is soo depressing
loongod5,The only ones complaining and bitching are the ones who have no life outside of Tarkov. Touch some grass and these changes may not seem so big.
Historical_Village93,"what is this pointless post, tarkov has audio issues, scav's that one tap you, cheaters, flea market fee's over the top, dehydration within 20 minutes of playing and i have to pay 30-40k roubles for nutrition unless i dedicate time to find some and on top of that i have to deal with memory leak, so i cant play the game with 60 fps, besides that every raid i have immense laggs and stutters.

  
i have a 2070rtx, i5-9600k, and 16gigs of ram

  
I have to adapt to this poorly designed mess of a game to even have fun. Why do i have to adapt to the poor design choices, you cant even say they're realistic or hardcore.  
1.6k hours btw. and this has to be my least favorite wipe played yet.  
And i played when there wasnt even a face hitbox, when the kolpak was best budget helmet  
eventhough you may enjoy your current time in tarkov, you can't just say, well people complain and it doesnt represent what ppl think, well okay, but the majority disagrees, current state is horrible, it is, it really is"
Bigman100500,"Is it just me? Or sound yes can be confusing some times but i can hear and navigate actually good now. May it depends on headset you using? My hyperx cloud 2 with virtual 7,1 on with old audio messed me way much more that this new audio.

Streets. First time booting on was a blast. Even with desinc and rubberbang problems, i was literally blown away how emmersive it is. Countless rooms, locked doors, windows, living rooms, kitchens. Just crawling around some stairs swipping door to door like Ready or not so great!

&#x200B;

Never cares about metas or ""best"" armor. There few building almost like copied from my old house. And sitting in my stash i thinking to myself what should i grab if i would need to go out the right now to find or take some food and water for my family, how i could protect my love ones waiting me."
Neither_Maybe_206,"I can’t really understand how someone that has been around some wipes still finds fun in an endless grind that gets harder and harder each time. Also with the audio your Progression is basically RnG on interchange and shoreline. I was pushed by a Pmc in Resort because he was making grass sounds inside the building.. wtf. I really find struggle in getting the fun I used to have. Also with the recent changes in Ammo my casual friends probably will stop pretty soon as all they can buy now is shit tier ammo and don’t make it far enough the line to craft the good stuff.

I really wonder what’s next in store to make it even less fun for someone that has a life outside of tarkov and cannot grind 12h a day. All those chads probably will run out of ppl to kill mid wipe because no one puts up with their meta gear when all they have is 5. ps"
RedSky99,"I don't care of every single change about the game, i adapt.

I can handle playing with my usp45 and FMJ.

BUT

I can't handle cheaters 3 game out of 4."
MrSehatram,I'm new to the game (60 ish hours) seen ALOT of people complaining on this sub but still having a really great time learning shoreline
1DGAF0S,"I am actually enjoying the wipe because i really like this game, but i am saddened that i can't enjoy it at his fullest due to poor performance. Audio feels terrible, memory leak problem makes my PC freeze after 2 raids (i followed the optimization guide) and i can't even play Streets of Tarkov, the big shot of this update. I enjoyed Tarkov at 100% last wipe being my first serious wipe and now that i have some knowledge of this game i thought i would enjoy this one at 110%, i even paid for the EOD edition, but all this mess is making me enjoy it at 50%. Still having a good time but i feel this is not what we deserve. BSG is supposed to make the game better, not worse. Toxicity sucks, i agree, but you can complain about the game problems and still enjoy it."
Xelanci,"This is my first wipe and I'm enjoying the game thus far, although it does feel unreasonable at times. I do have gripes about it, but no game hits the same as this one so I'm chillin."
RedHotPoppa,I am enjoying this wipe too but that doesn't stop me from criticizing them on their dumb changes.
-TDOGG-,The loud are often the few
justice_Cx,A lot of silent ppl also just quit. In the end BSG has stats on player retention so they know.
Affectionate-Ad3445,"Absolutely. I enjoyed it until about level 16. The game is objectively in a worse state than last wipe though.

Does that mean that people can't, or shouldn't enjoy this wipe? No, of course not.

I think this wipe is over for me sadly. But I have been playing since 2018, so It takes a lot to keep me playing all wipe anymore."
BertBerts0n,"By that logic there are also a lot of silent people that hate the changes. 

Source - trust me bro."
HeadEyesScav,I second that. Important to say and appreciate next to all the criticism!
Molly_Boy_420,Hjk
zZDKVZz,"Title is pretty much the main reason I avoid this subreddit entirely, too much people complaining that putted me in negative mood when I browse here."
WhiteLightWarrior,Ive been here since OG af Tarkov and this is the first wipe I really grind from the start! Level 36 and a fat stash its been great.  Lot of shit needs fixing of course but would it really be Tarkov if it wasnt dog shit? 😭
Swagnets,"Yep. Also unpopular opinion here, scavs aren't any harder than normal."
Skaidri675,"People keep forgetting that this is still the BETA version of the game and they want everything to work smoothly and without bugs.... Of course there are some bugs, desync and cheaters but it doesn't stop me and my friends from having fun because the amount of bugs and cheaters we are encountering is like once per 15-20 raids and it doesn't always end up dying.  
  
I feel like Tarkov players just have to cry about something to make them feel better after death. I bet most of these crying posts here are written right after death in tarkov. The best part is that most of these babies are still playing the game anyway.   
  
I suggest to all of you that are enjoying the game to not even look at crying babies posts and don't bother to try to change their mind."
