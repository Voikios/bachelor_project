shashybaws,First time?
KRS12368,"If you move stuf around a bunch and leave the spot open that it was originally in. You can restart the game a bunch and some if it will come back. Lost a full radio backpack and 2 large container, did that a bunch and got the 2 large containers back, sadly no radio"
JWARRIOR1,"happens, weirdly enough the game thinks that stuff still ""Exists"" in your stash you just cant access it. I had it happen with my materials container and i was still able to craft with it, weirdly enough"
Additional_Low_5606,It's kinda crazy how some of these bugs weren't addressed in the last update but they added a whole new AI boss and a bunch of guns with broken reload animations.
Maybedeadbynow,That's why keep junk in there üëç learned it hard way
FluffyPinkPantheon,Nothing is safe in this game even going in to raid with a gun in your bag just poofs it sometimes. Honestly just assume all gear is gonna poof so may as well lose it raiding.
lurowene,"Yep, quite traumatic your first time. Then you realize it‚Äôs a buggy ass game there‚Äôs no point in having a hoarders stash and gear fear. Run it down like it‚Äôs COD, go next fast, take fights."
ThighHighsSaveLives_,Honestly one of the big reasons I stopped playing. Lost my big green container full of ammo and then a week later lost a long crate full of crafting mats. Interesting gameplay loop they created but I just can‚Äôt be bothered to play it seriously when my shit just disappears lol. Sitting on 1mil + so I can replace everything but the grind feels a little pointless (not sure if it‚Äôs still technically an early access game).
Agreeable_Leek_6818,dont fiddle around when ur MM idiot
North21,"I have stopped playing before the wipe because of this stupid bug, I can‚Äôt believe that still happens."
some_random_nonsense,F
ConceivedEmu,"So when this happens to me, I dont move anything in my inventory, especially into the spot where the crate was. I immediately go back into raid, and immediately leave again. And every time, my items have returned."
Psychological_Ring_3,This happened to a large container I had awhile ago full of ammo ü•≤ü§ß my condolences
wintrFPV,You're not the first
Elegant_Monkey_Man,"Same thing happened to me. It had 4 gold bars and like 8 U.A. Intels. Was really disheartening. A game like Marauders that's loot based, has to have loot we can trust in. We need to trust that anything we gather we keep and won't just vanish randomly."
NaNiBy,Had this issue as well. My full crate of lvl 12 helmets dissappeared and got replaced by small bag. I could still see couple of helmets inside of it tho
SolidSufficient2668,"Oh, it gets better wait until the compact container deletes that you had all of your crafting supplies in that‚Äôll put a fucking smile on your face"
Maxfightmaster1993,Drag your containers around and you'll probably find out 2 got stacked on top of each other. Happened to me a couple times with large containers and I had it fixed in about 15 seconds
