MaxIrons,"Only cheaters I've run into so far is sawed-off sniper bots. [/j]  

Used to be I THOUGHT there were more cheaters than there really are, because I didn't really internalize just how quick TTK (Time To Kill) is in this game vs some other shooters, or where those shots could have come from.  Now I'm the one getting the angles and Terminator headcapping... sometimes.  Still a lot to learn, angles to figure out, and how to squeak with happiness when I get the cheese... I mean gold bullion."
unflinchingalva,"I have several more hours than you, and I would say I've run into MAYBE three blatant cheaters.

To anyone reading this, for some reason, Reddit always makes everything out to be worse than it actually is. It doesn't matter which sub. Gaming, politics, etc All games I play and see on Reddit are the same. Foxhole, Tarkov, Marauders, etc Very rarely are they ever pleased with the game. It's almost 80% complaints. 

If you see something being repeated over and over on a subreddit, it's really likely not as bad as it seems. Just a friendly reminder."
TTV_xxero_foxx,"They're definitely there. I've been playing 240 hours and ran into maybe a dozen sus plays, and only three blatant cheaters. The thing is the concurrent player count is only around 1k. The more that number grows the more cheaters will start to show up. Right now it's such a small community we pretty much keep running into the same people most of the time"
Additional_Low_5606,It's nothing compared to tarkov I can say that much ðŸ¤£
Shadow_Lazer,"It is bad, but it you can go a dozen games without any apparent hackers, and then join 6 games in a row with them.

Not sure if matchmaking has any ranking system that groups you with higher tier players if you play well, higher tier would be filled with hackers.

This game needs a much better anti-cheat"
nickybird23,I agree even the Steam Reviews is littered with people giving it a thumbs down after one death to a cheater and they claim the game Creators aren't doing anything about it. I've played only bout 30+ hours and I literally (unless I just can't tell the difference between a hacker and a really good player) haven't seen a single hacker.
LongStill,"I think most the people complaining about cheaters are just using it for copium. Are there cheaters? Yes, obviously, but no where near as much as this sub seems to think there is. Some post act like every other person is cheating, when most likely they just  fucked up, there was lag or just bad hit registration."
OverlordZombwich,"It honestly just depends on your server and the time of day you play. If you play in the morning on your regions servers you're playing majoritively against bots and Streamers. If you play during peak hours the player pool widens enough to where it might not be as noticeable.   


All PvP games have cheating issues, the team is working on it and has set the precedent now that it won't be tolerated. Which is more than enough reason to support them."
SnipsLOLz,I've been playing for 25 hours and have seen 2 blatant cheaters.. so this anecdote is kind of useless in adding to the conversation
PurePremium,"I do understand itâ€™s anecdotal but so is you playing 25 hours and encountering several. 

Youâ€™re sharing yours, Iâ€™m sharing mine. 

As an enthusiast of the game I know cheaters exist and want the devs to fix for health of the game."
Shoresy69420,F1
TotsukePrime,"Had a squad wipe, cause swings with a sten shooting at walls then shoot me and team mate on the head at 16 minute. But fun game still when there no cheaters"
studenator,38 hours. Squiddy killed me 4 times.
KinkyRoubler,I've only run into one. Speedhacking a capital ship and unloading on our rustbucket. He tried to shoot our pods point blank muzzlr stuff but we made it out barely. Wish we could have recorded it because it looked crazy seeing a capital ship zoom around taking out every ship on the map in seconds.
MountainMan9712,There aren't A LOT but they are 100% there....the other day I had someone in the red baron ship who teleported around the map killing everyone..I'd say out of 20 matches you'll find a hacker maybe once or twice...not bad but not good
Wavy_Beam,I've met at least 3 blatant cheaters
seabass0710,"The biggest cheater I run into is the developers. Severs frequently crash completely (for all players) when you decided to run your lvl 12 armor or a heavy MG ect, maybe you did a zero to hero and find yourself stacked, oh doesn't matter server will crash and now you're back to zero. Think you made it out of raid with your loot? Sorry wrong, loot deletes itself, crates delete themselves along with their contents, ships delete themselves. Want to play with friends? Good luck odds are someone in your party won't be able to matchmake with you unless their host and when that happens prepare to lose your red baron ship. Oh you mean you swapped to your rust bucket before joining, who cares still decides to just start deleting your ships because you're a cremated. Games fun, but literally trash."
bSurreal,"Got probably like 150 hours, ran into 2 cheaters with 1 other being sus. It's hardly rampant"
LeamHEAVY,"I've only seen one blatant cheater in my 40hrs. It was just a dude boarding people with a radio backpack full of scrap bombs. 

Killed him and they didn't put up a fight. I think they just wanted to get others banned. 

Seen a lot more cheaters in other similar games. Had people literally fly above me and pick of limbs one by one in Tarkov so Marauders has been a breath of fresh air."
YaBoyEvit,Honestly I've only had one slightly sus encounter ever and I think I'm at 80 hours. It must be much worse on other servers.
elder-scrolls-fan,"Iâ€™ve run into one maybe 2 people whom Iâ€™ve suspected of cheating, itâ€™s really not as common as people hype it up to be"
Plastic-Ad-503,"Another avid player here and Iâ€™ve only run into one definite hacker Iâ€™ve played probably 40 or 50+ hours, they definitely exist but I agree that this sub makes it seem like they are in every game"
SilentDragaur,I have over 60 hours and I can't say I've seen any cheating. It is possible I don't know what to look for though. Ha
ThatOneBuilderGuy,"I've had one encounter with a blatant cheater in about 130 hours, but reading through the subreddit does make it seem more common than it is"
ScoobertD,"In around 85 hours the past few weeks I think thereâ€™s been maybe once me and my friend were a bit suspicious of someone, but even then it was just prolly weird shit with the connection or something like that."
WiseGuye,At least 2 for me maybe. Anyone who says like 10 or something like that just doesn't lean and runs corners and gets blasted then they claim cheaters lol.
AnonymousAligator,What servers do you play on? I play EU and there's never really any cheaters bit when I played with people from NA it felt like hackers were there every other game
mcgregger101,I have almost 300 hours and have ran into squiddy999 twice and he was the only hacker I've ever ran into and that was Mayne 100 hours in between those two encounters
ALP1N3SN1P3r,Have 320 hours. Top 100 on LB. Very few cheaters. I have ran into prob about 5-10 in 2000 marauder kills. Itâ€™s just resdit
usingreadit,"It is the ""kill a game by negative feedback and overdone criticism"" gang, at work once more"
