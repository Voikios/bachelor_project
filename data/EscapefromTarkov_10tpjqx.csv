OK_1M_REL0ADED,"Your HS was good, his was better."
DeouVI,I guess he was faster according to the server.
Phaejix,Dang dude not only did you blast him but his guns barrel was pointed up when you died ü§î
Turtvaiz,Left peek = dead in this game
udum420,Inb4 every excuse under the sun.
Red_040,"The Boondocks, yeaaa"
LukeTheRevhead01,(he swung on you)
DxAxxxTyriel,that was a SCAV moment
Stock-Chemist6872,Netcode of this game is simply amazing. Can't wait for perma effects after death it will sure not kill this game BSG.
Single-Fondant6481,Could also that all your Pellets just hit the right arm ^^...so tarkov did not count it as headshot
sm0keyii,Loved the choice of Boondocks music
X57471C,"No comment on the issues of the game, this thread debate just reminded me of that scene in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (the book) where the team is training with the simulation equipment (been a while since I read it). One of the characters takes out a bad guy and in the after action report he gets told that he was KIA because the bad guy he shot involuntarily held down the trigger as he was falling to the ground dying and one of those stray bullets hit him :P"
BeNz_REDDIT,"Summary:

Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.

Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).

Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.

Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because you were already dead."
Dat_Innocent_Guy,"his arm ate your buckshot. and for sure no pellets damaged his thorax through the redut-m. The 3rd person aim punch animation probably played on your screen but on his screen, by the time he fired, he hadn't been hit yet. Probably what happened."
mrbawkbegawks,"dont feel bad i shot a guy 8 times with flechette today laying in a bush with blue armor on and they got up and shot me as i was reloading...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

.... walked past them and kneeled on their back and shot them with the barrel touching their armor.. it said like 32 hits with 7 shots...."
beansahol,"Just playing devils advocate here: you shot him once in the chest (still was during recoil) and he shot you in the head, but yes there was some animation desync. Anyway you will literally almost always die if you run around corners like this."
TechnologyNo1743,Nice arm shot. But unfortunately for you he was shooting your face.
pleiadespc,"What‚Äôs this clip, you shot him body there is no headshot here just paused it as the recoils goes to head height. I‚Äôm dying to bullshit all day in this game but this ain‚Äôt it"
extaz93,"It has nothing to do with netcode and desyncs. 
You did hit this guy in the arms/thorax. He's wearing a class 5, even if you had Flechette, that makes total sense that he killed you."
AwardOrganic7038,"You hit him in the thorax while he has a redut on, t5 armor he ate the thorax shot and the bloodstain looked head level bit you shot his thorax and he fully ate it then u died, I don't really see the problem"
ThrowRUs,"Pretty sure he's wearing class 4-5 armor, even though the blood is there, you can clearly see that you shot him point blank in the chest.  That coupled with desync is the reason you likely died."
ChefCobra,He clearly had better gaming chair.
SlyXross,"I swear if tarkov had great latency, my pmc count would be 3 times what it is, so many times i have shot someone first thinking i got them only to die 2 seconds later."
it1345,Its frustrating they aren't even attempting to make this shit better.
Mishka_Shishka_,Ushanka coming in clutch again.
bucken764,Had to put the game down for a bit because of crap like this.
fratzi,netcode 101
SUNTZU_JoJo,"Well yeah..what did you expect?

Ever heard of netlag/network latency?

You were dead before you even fired that bullet, willing to bet it didn't even register that shot on your end raid screen.

These posts getting old..."
DemiVoltzM,"There's no excuse but to understand what could/likely happened.


When you shot his head and seen the blood created on the wall behind. Understand that this is client side, so what you see is not 100% what the server will see.

On the server side it is likely that his shot registered first (maybe the server is shit, his internet is better and the list goes on. The server decided based on his shot Info reaching the server first that the kill shot he shot is counted and as such your shot was not.

I agree it's frustrating and trust me, I get into these situations lots of times. The game is still being improved and it's not released yet. There's more work to be done and in development, this can take a long time."
shilunliu,server decided you died
TubbbbyCustard17,Nah fam the scavvy boi was just bird hunting. Swing that shotty like ur shooting trap
PanProjektor,"This wipe Ushanka Is lvl5 top, nape, ears, lvl6 eyes, jaw."
Mayor_Fuglycool,"Peek before you push

Oh and yeah Tarkov DESYNC is total trash LOL"
YounggunJohn,"Laughed out loud, thank you"
BossJohns,"Similar thing happened to me today, I swung on a guy, dumped half a mag in him, he slowly walked forward as I shot him, he turned away from me and fired a burst and that killed me. Desync is strong today"
Rhino___1,The hand shield
k0vacc,"I watched all the funny contents in this reddit.and I wonder, how come there are still people playing this game. XD"
loocifahh,Get tarkoved
Joey-S-,First week of wipe I did over 1000 damage between armor and body to a single scav only to get 180 head eyes
Booyakasha_,You people know that you can choose your servers right?
Fra5er,How can you play this broken ass game
Objective-Lawyer-368,"Looks like a netcode issue, I'm sure you both died. It is what is."
ridgegr,The excuse is tarkov
PoperzenPuler,"Your shot was not scored because you had already died. It is a typical desync case. Many people don't seem to understand this. You don't die even though you're already in cover. You already died before hiding, but because of the desync your client didn't know you were dead and let you go a few steps further. Exactly the same thing happens when shooting. Depending on the weapon, your last 1-3 shots before you die are not counted because your client doesn't know yet that you died."
A1pH4W01v,"You see this is obviously a skill issue. Clearly a PROFESSiONaL like me wouldve easily ran out, run through the handguards, walk on the AIR and swing the fuck out of that scav while skillfully tracking the center of his head.

&#x200B;

*^(/s)*"
Snoo-80419,Playing at 119 ping that scav will wreck that ass everytime. Trim down the higher ping servers and that shot may have won...
Maleficent-Step4108,"He had glasses, shame on you!"
Omisco420,Skill issue
PM-ME-YOUR-TITS,I know that song but I can't place where it's from. It's some TV show right?
cory-balory,"Really good game, I can see why people still play it"
DrHighlen,Your ping was like 120.... this  suppose to happen
HeadFig8311,"Boondocks, a man of culture I see."
XxcOoPeR93xX,"Peekers advantage vs left hand peek


Which way, game engine?"
UltimiteKing,Servers r so bad sometimes man
peter4959,Not a head shot yo7 hit the chest or arms get good
cb8271,He has a better chair
physicsOG,üòÇüòÇ
Hungry-Opening-420,The huge desync.....How the fuck can a game in year 2023 have so much latency.....And do something about all the cheap lagswitching cheaters
ElderberryDry9083,Another victim of desync. The shot registers locally but not server side so he probably never even got hit or aim punched.
Wellheythere3,You need to run around the corner if you‚Äôre gonna left hand peek so you‚Äôre as far away from your ‚Äúghost‚Äù as possible and get the biggest window possible to kill whoever is around. He saw you coming way before you actually did because you took so long
SurrealLemon,am I tripping or is that scav waring a fucking Redut
throwawayaccountgtfo,What song?
HalleyC0met,"I don't think that was an headshot, I think you hit him in the chest and the splash of blood you  saw was actually coming from the back of his chest. If you see the weapon alignment that seems to be what's happening"
scarecrow6911,"You were already dead when you shot, doubt the first shot even went off for him"
StigmaINC,"In case anyone is wondering what the correct play was, it was to sprint out and prefire. Walking out with a left handed peek is instant death. Not saying op is bad, this is just a tip for those inexperienced with using desync to your advantage. If anyone wants more clarification let me know and Ill try to help."
BukLauFinancial,"You shot him in the stomach/chest, the blood behind his head is because of the angle you're looking at him from vs the angle the blood hit the wall. You might not have killed him, but you for sure fucked his day up.

Next time go for the head shot."
Ok_Alternative_2541,Ricochets hit hard lol
Nawrly17,"Left peek & there wasn't enough room to swing wide. That wasn't an ideal scenario, I would've retreated and held another angle."
Haksupaksu,This is why I dont pvp in resort or dorms
emerging-tub,"I just came here to say, Jesus was black, Ronald Reagan was the devil, and the government is lying about 9/11."
chemiculs,he's just better.
leroyjenkinsdayz,Clearly the pellets bounced off the wall and into your eyes
WhiteLightWarrior,See the problem is you just suck.  You swung like a noob walking out.  If you did a running step swing you woulda clapped him.
Clewds,this is the content i come here for
smileyninja3650,BS aside. You left hand peaked him. You were dead before that second shot left your barrel. Unfortunate comrade. Get back out there and do it to someone else
grandpas-gooch69,Bro the boondocks theme got me lmfao
habbapabba,he dead. ushanka is powerful against many things. not a 12 gauge shotgun shell to the forehead
M0RTY_C-137,Prefire
dlowis,"Left arm peaks are dangerous. Half your body is visible before you can see them, plus accounting for any desync, dangerous."
ghoths,Welcome to tarkov bud
Yakamomo,In what universe is this a headshot‚Ä¶
