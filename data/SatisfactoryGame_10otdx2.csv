Crosstowndonkey,Hahahaa I remember my first ever time playing years ago I set up my coal there and I made the most Jank road with a tractor to get it. That poor tractor
ZelWinters1981,Zoop some foundations.
Muffinzor22,This is the one game where terrain doesnt pose a shred of an issue. No canyon is too large and no cliff is too steep for some good old physics defying concrete.
mTz84,"If starting in the Grass Fields, I'd recommend to leave the southern coal nodes for steel production. Move north to the crater lake for coal power, there are 4 normal nodes and enough water right next to each other."
shalfyard,That's a good node for steel production if you run out up to where you are currently standing. Got a few iron nodes a copper node and a couple limestone. That's enough to make a decent early steel factory... That's what i did anyways. Even modified it later when i got better belts and better steel ingot recipe.
houghi,"And the fun thing is, that is not the best one to do the first coal. Leave this for steel. Use the coal near the lakes more to the North."
TheStreetForce,"Ya kno I spent probably a year at least running round, looking up and over at things going ""how tf am I gonna get to that!?"" jump jump jump die. Buikt fuel and a jetpack. Better but not enough.

Its a damn building game! I can just build foundations and ladders and walls wherever the hell I want. Deeerrrrrrrp. Ah well."
Cyzax007,"You can deploy the miner on it from where you're standing, and string the electricity wire and belts as well, just go across where the gap is smallest.   
I usually have the coal power going from it long before I actually visit the location :-p"
dotEff,Be thankful that the game doesn't have Valheim structural integrity mechanic. Imagine having to build a working bridge just to get over the gap.
W34kness,"Then suddenly you learn, with concrete, the sky is the limit"
Enudoran,I have my Computer Factory over the gap between this thing and the mainland.
Stage_Party,"When I made my first factory I made coal power there, it was perfect. That was before coal generators needed water..."
roermoer,I stood on the exact same spot and managed to place a miner + conveyor belt on it from afar
Kilo1125,Also my first mistake with coal. I ran a conveyor all the way to small lake west of the Iron cliffs...then discovered coal crater lake to the north on my first expedition after building the generators.
LeaveForNoRaisin,I remember when it took me way too much brain power to realize I can just float foundations in mid air.
Dragunav,"I always pick the coal deposits to the north, there's a lake just next to it so you can set up the powerplants without any hassle."
CupStill7650,Just build ?? That's how I did it
Muckymuh,"I built a conveyor belt over. It's juuust enough to reach the other side.

Alternatively, on another save I used a jump pad."
TheDrHoiliday,Yeh i Been to that Place i have to have Two Coal Lines Just to Run my 6 Coal Power-Plants and Make Tteel and it's a Pain
Sebastien_Crow,I reserve that coal node exclusively for steel production
DarkartDark,They make zoop for a reason. This reason
RealDEady42,"Step 1: find coal mines. 
Step 2: find water source. 
Step 3: build maximum of hydro electro stations and power them from one another. 
Step 3: upgrade stations to max with power slugs. 
Step 4: get free electricity. 
Biofuel will go bankrupt.
Logic will go bankrupt.
Automation issues will go bankrupt.
You jelly?"
P45t4P0m0d0r0,Ahah I can feel it
Spacer176,Time to order a foundation bridge.
According-Gain-4408,"I went to the right, where the islands are close, and turned my back to one of those rhino enemies. He attacked me and the impact bumped me to the island"
caaroliis,Somehow I managed to put a miner there from the other side of the cliff without crossing It… and then i just built conveyor belts crossing the cliff…
Thelnferno_666,I remember it
Gonemad79,"Sky bridge foundations, of course."
totally_unbiased,"Truck stations will help a lot with this. Use a bit of the coal to fuel the truck, truck the coal over to water for your power plants. Use foundations to bridge the gap.

Also get the blade runners asap, they make the world a lot smaller. I was actually just exploring this area last night because I'm about to build my supercomputer factory in the grasslands - it's not as far away as it feels."
UnsettllingDwarf,I JUST GOT THAT SPOT ON MY WORLD!! Built a bridge and it’s not that bad.
fexfx,Zoop makes this no problem at all.  Pre Zoop this was a bitch.
Terobl,Dam you got me
Correct_Memory8914,"yes coal, but no water"
Eric_Bigglesworth,Am I the only one who went with the coal in the water pit just above the green grasslands?
SirShallNotAppear,i just used a level one conveyor belt to cross the gap
Peakomegaflare,See.. I had to deal with it before Zoop was a thing. Even worse when you needed to build a downward ramp from above!
Pangamma,Accurate AF
