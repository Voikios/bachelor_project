Longjumping_Bug_7611,"2 pieces of gold is a loaf of bread and a mead and the The Bee and Barb. A full stomach and some music for an evening distraction is not a bad way to end a day. 

We cant all be fucking Dragonborn you twat!"
KlooShanko,POV: I just quicksaved
dralth,I keep watching this video waiting for the lock to open.
IceCreamMeatballs,Always pissed me off how you couldn‚Äôt disguise yourself as a guard
godzylla,These kinds of locks are what taught me to measure pixels.
NYstate,"*Zooms in tight on face* 

**Guard: ""STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM!""**"
anotverygoodwritter,It‚Äôs rough out there in the streets man!
captrudeboy,Just downloaded it again last night. This time I'm going straight 2 handed barbarian. Not gonna devolve into a stealthy archer again. I swear....aaaaaaand I'm crouching
Notfriendly123,"Lockpicking is a whole other world on switch mobile, you can hold the switch up to your ear and hear the clicks just like a real lock"
Ramdrothegoat,The first time I played Skyrim was to see If I should get it and the first few seconds were of me spinning my way to victory as someone said ‚Äúhey your finally awake‚Äù
pimezone,Broken seven pins to open the chest and get two back
LimitlessRetardation,It was never about the money...
acidphosphate69,Do you not have any sneak skill? I've literally never once been caught lockpicking in at leat 1500 hours of play and never once putting perks into lockpicking.
MyRedditUsername1101,"Actually, I'm the thane"

Oppressed_Gaming,Risk? With this lock picking system for babies? Try picking a lock in Kingdom Come Deliverance.
Muchsadlilhappy,I just lure big Boi to them and loot the body üòÇ
GoldenGodMayorLewis,You'll be fine. Meanwhile in Oblivion you accidentally touch an apple on a table and every guard in a 50 mile radius is tracking you down to arrest you.
VillainofAgrabah,"Unless you're braindead with no grasp of Skyrim's sneak system you're not risking anything lmao, the game pauses while you lockpick."
iCanHazUsrnm,"Remember the vaults of Morrowind? Most rewarding theft in any video game ever. After that, lockpicking has never felt the same."
Kikutwo,Plink.
thealinarose,Along with breaking like 10 lockpicks
banditx19,One of the games I sunk insane amounts of hours into and never beat. The journey really is incredible.
Viendictive,"Psht! My POV has a skeleton key in there, and my sneak skill would hide a fart in a box."
AholeBrock,Except time freezes on this screen so their is no tension or risk of a guard walking up on you as you do this. It's not morrowind.
Nutsnboldt,Why does it say no sound but I can hear it clearly?
LoyalV,"""Click out of one... Nothing on two... Three is lollygagging..."""
ProgandyPatrick,"Novice lock: 500 gold and jewelry

Master lock: 12 gold and 5 lock picks to replace the dozens you just broke."
Knight_Of_Nani,Worth It!!
DeadOnRival,"My mind immediately, ""So, it's a challenge?"""
Enfosyo,Do people who still play Skyrim simply never buy any other games?
2-EZ-4-ME,make a lock picking lawyer player and these locks are nothing
Crazyjoedevola1,Wait. I know you..
EnduringFrost,Even better if you start doing this mid combat
HotTakes4HotCakes,Basket --> Head
aDogNamedZeek,Skyrim has the worst loot system.
Jagzon,POV: You don‚Äôt have the skeleton key yet
Based_nobody,(I watched this for a lot longer than I should have)
sciencebased,"Morrowind was better.

Jk, I need to revisit Skyrim with all the mods out these days."
R2_D2aneel_Olivaw,Upvoted for proper use of the meme.
Anotheryoma,Me in VR reaching through and opening it from the other side.
EvilCeleryStick,That moment when you realize you can slaughter the whole of whiterun if you want to...
Heroiccrayfish,POV of someone who should have never come here‚Ä¶
VictorPedroNamura,I challenge the Gods merely for the XPüòé
daboobiesnatcher,My favorite thing about Skyrim is how rewarding it is to dig through every nook and cranny of everywhere. Nothing satisfies me like clearing an unnecessary wing of a dungeon killing a bunch of extra enemies just to find some draugr arrows and an apple.
bobjoekaren,I only recently purchased skyrim SE and didn't expect the subreddit to be very active. Pleasantly surprised to see the community still going strong
2a_1776_2a,I hate that elder scrolls is taking an eternity to release ughhhh
tunkerball,"I watched this for longer than I care to admit, in anticipation of something actually happening."
jcoffin1981,I broke all the lockpicks
RedOrchestra137,28k upvotes for a 1 second gif of someone jiggling a skyrim lock? amazing
Awesome0Sauce,"*breaks 5 lockpicks

DarkShadowsBrain,Hoping and praying the quicksave works just in case

Dankkring,Skyrim has a good lock pick system. Much better than oblivion‚Äôs was lol
Thecrawsome,Reddit's serial reposters are so annoying
C8S7-C137,It's called an invisibility spell/potion.
shinobi500,I AM the danger
Rutegger,Never a dull moment in Skyrim? That game is the definition of dull.
DepletedMitochondria,Very much preferred clicking repeatedly in Morrowind
Powerdrake,"After 2000+ hours in skyrim I'm at a point where I've stopped picking almost all half the chests I find except the big reward chests at the end of dungeons which are guaranteed to have atleast something decent.

You break 20 lock picks on an expert or master lock only to get  25 gold, a stamina potion and an enchanted ring worth nothing and whose enchantment you already know."
uneffinlucky,"Man I‚Äôve been waiting on it to snap, dang loops lol"
Sailor_Lunatone,"It‚Äôs not really worth it, but there‚Äôs a perk that lets you pick locks without alerting people on the lockpicking tree."
oaktreebr,Call the LockPickingLawyer
Untelligent_Cup_2300,I loved skyrim lockpicking because all you needed was to personally as a player get good enough to pick all locks.
Noodle-Works,"put pots on their head first, for gods sake!"
No_Bother_6885,I really wish they had copied this lock picking mechanic in kingdoms come deliverance.
Sierra419,I‚Äôm playing Witcher 3 right now and I‚Äôve had to kill dozens of armed soldiers just so I could steal an empty glass jar from a barrel
sillypunt,How longbdid everyone else watch this waiting for it to open?
slash178,Two pieces of gold AND a level up in lockpicking
Notawordplease,Nerve racking
B-R0ck,The indestructible lock pick
Standard-Assist-5793,"""im with the guild. I just slaughtered half your town, attacked the yarl, killed a dozen guards and stole all your jewels and gold. Will 450 gold cover it?"""
Shandyxr,All for the skill ups!
MrDoctorSpoon,And I‚Äôll do it again
adamdoesmusic,"Lockpicking on the Switch version includes haptic feedback, it‚Äôs almost too easy!"
Sallymander,That looks like an eyeball with a keyhole iris
sulris12,"I always wondered about why we find gold everywhere, but then I came to find out that it's because every character in the game gets the imperial lucky passive when they leave Helgen due to poor programming."
GioBeMyName13,Skyrim is a game where you can creat a butter knife that can send dragons to mars but not a door
Givemeurhats,That's why you save the game first and reload when they catch you. Same with pickpocketing
Fashajualia,Me trying to open every box in Thalmor embassy . Good thing for quicksave . Except one time I got stuck quicksaving there . When I would load and the Thalmor discovered me so I had to restart my game
feelin_fine_,It took me way too long to notice this is an extremely short gif
DrexTrex23,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
WitnessingProfit,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve enjoyed a better lock picking system to date. I wish every game had the Skyrim lock pick mechanic.
harsh9101,Huh? Must be wind
Alt27X,"Anyone know what door their lockpicking? Feel like it's in Whiterun, but I'm not sure."
gyarnar,You can pick locks in Skyrum?
sancho_tranza,"This makes me want to replay Skyrim.. maybe try a new class this time, definetly not a stealthy Khajit archer for the fourth time in a row... Definetly something different"
redconvict,When the whole game is dull then nothing will feel dull.
Pretzel-Kingg,ü§® those guards are risking the full wrath of my quicksave if they think about interrupting me
Sabertooth472,haha love this game!
gojira5,Well back in my days
xtr44,I always appreciate a proper use of POV meme üí™
hazelgirl9696,it's always the last one too. i used to save and load again on the hard ones. XD
levitating_cucumber,Nah stealing 2 gold from the guards would be more risky but that f5 is bulletproof
Vladomirtheinhaler,"I have been an elder scrolls fan since playing morrowind as a child. Oblivion was great. Open world games are my favorite and I‚Äôve always been a a fan of fantasy games. I got Skyrim the day it came out and remember being obsessed with it. I‚Äôve beaten it as every race and in every different way possible at least 3 times each. Throughout the years I will randomly start a new play through. Once I got a PC I started modding and since then I‚Äôve beaten at least 10 times. I just recently started a new modded play through. I love to mod the game to be extremely difficult. I use mods to change the perk trees and get 3 times as many perk points to try and keep the game balanced. I only play on legendary. The character I play now is always a huge jacked AF Breton that is a jack of all trades. The game is so hard that I have to start out in a dungeon going stealthy with a bow. Then once I get detected I switch to magic then once the enemy gets closer I switch to magic with sword and after I get hit a few times I switch to sword and shield. I will also hot key my armor and start out with light armor for stealth then switch to heavy armor once the enemy closes the difference. I also modded the perk trees for werewolves, vampire lord, and vampire now has its own perk trees. I add the ability to fly as vampire lord. My character ends up being a super powerful werewolf, vampire lord, and vampire all at the same time. Even with my character being extremely badass I still die after 1 or 2 hits from almost any enemy. It‚Äôs really fun. I have to be extremely OP and use everything at my disposal and even then I‚Äôll die 10+ times just from one battle."
rorichudoku,That's why you quicksave before lockpicking
The_Big_Peck_1984,It‚Äôs not about the money it‚Äôs about you g your lockpocking skill
SnooEagles5504,Its never about the gold its about the message that i can pick this master level lock with 0 skill points in lock picking
Yontevnknow,STOP RI \[F9\]
RivasToSea,Priestess Wind-walker from the Whiterun Temple sent a crew of thugs to beat me after I stole 2gp
03Titanium,It‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm the Thane of Whiterun.
cryptosporidium140,"I have the Billy Madison mod so it always yells ""You blew it!!!"" when I break a pick. Otherwise vanilla Skyrim"
Don11390,"Bro, it's OK, I'm a Thane. Yeah, I know I used that excuse after I beat Nazeem to death with my bare hands, but still."
TechNickL,"Skyrim is incredibly corrupt. If you kill someone in view of a guard, they might attack to save face in front of the people they're supposed to protect. But if they don't, or they don't see you, it's a mere 1000 gold to get out of any real punishment. You can get that much by flogging one dungeons worth of random shit."
Iancreed,I usually don‚Äôt even bother picking the locks
Minimalphilia,It is all about the exp.
Salishseahound,test am I unbanned ü•∫
Total-Lock4108,"Pov you aren't over one of the most overrated games of all time. Bland repetitive level  and enemy design. Half the creatures of the other games. Easy basic combat and level up. But hey any game where after only 5 quest into the dark brotherhood you kill the emperor and no one in game talks about it is so epic man. Whoa what excellent writing and game design I mean the other games literally start with the death of the emperor and it's a huge deal but fuck even coding in lines where people mention it. Honestly have better taste, you people have been rewarding mediocrity for over a decade. Tfw you have to install over 200 mods to make a game playable"
AzemadaiusKaiser,IT‚ÄôS WORTH IT!
ManEEEFaces,‚ÄúTwo is binding‚Ä¶‚Äù
Toothpicktoes,"Me risking a pickpocket that has 3% chance to work, just to steal a hat worth 6 gold"
anormalgeek,"It's not about the money. It's about sending a message. 

I will steal EVERYTHING, do you understand? Fus-Ro-gimme yo shit!"
yoyoJ,Actual POV nice
Ryanp356,"Why I love morrowind. That level 80 locked chest? Just 10 gold, 1 scuttle and maybe a petty soul gem. The level 10 crate next to it? 20k worth of fantastic loot."
rubyspicer,"Just turn the thing quietly, listen to the *tink tink tink* sounds until one sounds louder than the rest. That's the one to open it. Everyone else prolly figured this out years ago tho lol"
Tooblicker,Miss the old days when Bethesda use to let you bash the door open if you had the strength.
SonofRaymond,I haven‚Äôt played in a long time but you were able to pick any lock in the game no matter your skills but the mini game was harder?
model3113,"I don't know the experiences of others but I thought the mechanic was remarkably physically intuitive, and the perk tree basically sat empty and unused in all my stealth playthroughs"
Reecosuavey,A POV meme that's actually a POV??
Articulated,"Hey at least you can pick locks in Skyrim.

In Kingdom Come: Deliverance you get the lockpicking screen, then all your picks are gone."
gypsy-ghost,"If you want the ultimate, you must be willing to pay the ultimate price"

hey_rowsdower,"E3 showcase of the next Bethesda RPG:

Todd Howard: ""This game will have next generation graphics, a skill tree with over four hundred choices, a fully destructible environment and an actual AI dialogue engine that will react to your spoken word in-game...""

*Tepid clapping from the audience*

Todd Howard pauses for dramatic effect. The lights go low, the audience holds its collective breath in anticipation: ""And most important of all... A lockpick mini-game!""

*The audience goes wild*"
