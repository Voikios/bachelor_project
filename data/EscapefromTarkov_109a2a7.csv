platinums99,"I love it when a rebound works out, I got one off a tree in Shoreline once, it corrected the aim and landed on the pmc I was trying to aim at"
Few_Ad648,I had a moment like this the other dayüòÇ me and some dude were fighting in the room opposite of green screen after I killed his buddy. He was in the hallway while I was in the weapon room and I went to throw the nade into the hallway and I guess it came into the room. Well he pushed and we both potato‚Äôd every shot. He ended up standing on the nade and it blacked out everything but my head and one leg lmao

HelloHiHeyAnyway,"I've had these same potato grenades kill people. I had one on labs that was absolutely hilarious. A gunfight I probably wasn't going to win. He rushes my grenade, it potatoes, it explodes as I run to not kill myself. 

I really wish I had replay setup then. It wasn't until the end of that wipe that I bothered to set it up.

It's satisfying in a way... and you also kinda feel bad knowing your failure killed them. Some kind of 200 iq grenade."
Sargash,"Try bringing M67s and follow them up with an impact

Toss M67 into enemy room, area, watch as they flee, then peg their ass without lube."
wakupaku,obviously calculated... feel so good when this kinda stuff happens
AttackerCat,"Was on customs in a squad of three yesterday. There was someone in Unknown bush we were having a standoff with, and friend decides to chuck a nade. I hear a distinctly loud clunk of a grenade hitting the wall right next to me.

I hear him yell and we all just scatter. Luckily we didn‚Äôt friendly nade and even better it scared off the guy on the other side of the wall."

SuspiciousDro,"The other day I died to a grande I threw out a window. Saw the window break, saw the grenade fly out, turns out it actually bounced off the wall and exploded at my feet. 

Thanks BSG"
