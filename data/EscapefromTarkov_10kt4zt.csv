DuckInCup,"Reddit is like product reviews, most people who are upset leave bad reviews, most people who are happy leave nothing."
DonCalzone420,"I care and I haven't quit. I'm genuinely worried about the future of my favourite game which becomes more and more unplayable. When the majority quits and the servers are getting shut down, you will probably care too."
momentslove,"Dear OP,  
Thank you for your post of 23 Jan 2023. After careful consideration, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to care about me quitting the video game known by the name Escape from Tarkov.  


This year I have been particularly fortunate in experiencing an unusually large number of bad raids. With a growing number of varied ways of ridiculous deaths it is impossible for me to accept all ignorance from the EFT sub.

  
Despite your outstanding qualifications and previous experience in dissing frustrated fellow Redditors/former EFT players, I find that your refusal to care does not meet my needs at this time. Therefore I will initiate posting rants on your favorite sub known as  r/EscapefromTarkov, immediately following this letter. I look forward to seeing you there.

  
Sincerely,

A Tarkov Escaper"
algumnome,I care because the game will soon approach the dead raids point of the wipe. Specially on labs.
AftT3Rmath,"Nobody cares until the game is dead and the servers are shut down.

Then its ""what could they have done?!""

Seen it too many times."
CarloBear,"I don't  care about your post, but i'll reply to it."
p00ty916,I have 15k hours. I hate this game.
DavidisGamingHD,"Most of us do care if genuine (and casual) players quit playing. Why? Because without them, the game dies. Last wipe I rarely ran into players (mostly cheaters and the odd chad), because all the genuine players had left to play a game that was less broken, less cheater infested, less bullshit.

Don't be stupid."
Shovi,"Says he doesnt care you are quitting, he then takes time and effort to make a post to show how he doesnt care.... Does anyone else think it reeks of irony in here?"
dorekk,BSG probably cares.
Astalonte,"It s always sad when people stop playing.

You should care bec you will have less people to play with"
IndoorDuck,"Maybe you should listen to the people who support the game you love instead of trolling like a basement dweller all over the subreddit. You are actually worse than those who tell us why they are quitting the game, at least they provide something to the community."
Legal_Car_9406,You guys do realize this game is never gonna release or it’s gonna release with a lot of cutting corners at the pace of development and the vision for the game we are about 5-8 years out from that product 13 patches in 7 years and its lost its vision a bit lately so don’t expect what was promised ever with this game
JeffTheShark6969,I have finally escaped from tarkov /s
raztjah,"It actualy matters if people stop playing even if you think not, later youll understand why ;)"
xKiLzErr,This post is a perfect example of how horrible the Tarkov community is lmao
saint5678,"I think its important for the devs to know that decisions they have made/not are impacting their player base... like catering to blatant cheaters, or horribly destroying the sound design... I agree that people clogging the feed, whoring for karma by saying ""tarkov bad reeee"" is annoying, but so is taking the hardline stand of ""If you dont love this game fuck you"""
rkhale01,"At this point I've put thousands of hours into tarkov and I want to say about 85% of that has been enjoyable. I hope it continues to grow and become the game people want it to be, but if it shuts down tomorrow, I will be okay. I have gotten my money's worth, made lots of friends in voip, and have genuinely enjoyed myself and really that's what matters."
Faesarn,"This is actually a pretty popular opinion. The kind of posts 'Im leaving the game' usually have a majority of comments saying like 'okay' 'bye' 'who cares'.  

Feels like the majority of 'unpopular opinions posts are popular opinion and people trying to get easy internet points.."
Countcristo42,Yet you think people care about your opinion on their posts?
Princesse_LaStar,"Yeah but it's important to understand why people are living if you don't want your game to be a desert land.
So thanks to all people's feedbacks.

But I also understand that it's tiredness to read the same posts other and other. If BSG just said, 'Ok we eared that' maybe it will help."
N8LZ,Popular Opinion: no one cares about you writing this thread
Kaneypoo69,Maybe they should fix the issues and we wouldn't get so many
Super_camel_licker,"I agree, also, no one cares about this dumbass Reddit post."
_baundiesel_,Even fewer people care about you making this self serving post.
VoidVer,I always come here looking for cool clips or interesting game knowledge and leave having read a bunch of tantrum posts.
Uncle_Bobby_B_,This post makes me hate this community even more.
_inertia_creep_,"People don't don't care that you don't care, what can you do, yep nothing"
Officialsquareidiot,good for you
CaptG33ch,We don't care that you don't care. Now go play your game.
Cpt_Brainlag,"Reddit probably doesn't care but the devs should care

Each wipe they add more content but me and my mates see less and less of it each time because of the bullshit surrounding the game

Two wipes ago I tried completing as many quests as possible and even got SBIH done for the first time and maxed each trader

Last wipe they increased the distance to 125m for no reason so I didn't even bother anymore, didn't get to lvl 42 to get max traders

This wipe I'm level 24 and I already feel fatigued with all the bullshit I experience each raid

This game becomes more and more like a chore to play, sound is broken, scav AI is ass, gunplay feels so goddamn floaty that it's hard to even stay on target unless you lie on the ground (my bigges issue), quests and general progression becomes much more tedious each wipe

One of the biggest jokes this wipe is probably light keeper - they teased this first ingame trader for so long just to gatekeep it so far back into the progression system that most people probably won't even attempt to unlock him

Tbh if my mate didn't still play the game I would have probably already dropped it this wipe

And I don‘t think I'm burnt out since I already only play occasionally this wipe, much less than the wipes before"
myironlung6,"“I don’t care at all! That’s why I took the time to post that I don’t care at all. No one cares! Cause I speak for the entire player base and we don’t care. Again, I care so little that I typed out this asinine post to tell you I don’t care.”"
Mettn,"I'd say this is the opposite of an ""unpopular opinion"""
L0stVagab0nd,I mean you might care when no one's really playing the game anymore cuz they all quit
Banerinho,I'll remind you of this when the game is dead in 3-4 years.
Shpongolese,No one cares that you don't care that people are quitting EFT
Wunon,Popular Opinion: No one cares that you are upset about people saying they are quitting EFT
paragon_agent,"Respectfully disagree. I enjoy this game but *not* its flaws. If people making dramatic ""I quit EFT"" announcements even nudges BSG in the right direction, I'm all for it."
Crockpotspinner,"That does it, I'm quitting because no one cares if I quit."
xHuntaaaa,"Popular opinion, no one cares about this post"
Zeto3r,This was the narrative for pubg first. Than the game died.
Novver,"Well, enough players quitting would make you care for sure.  
But i get your point, i feel the same."
Castam3r3,my man prefer playing against bot then players. i respect your decision.
Greenleaf2023,Quitting a game because of an issue is a good way to let a developer know that an issue is a priority to fix rather than just something annoying
ProfitInitial3041,"Unpopular opinion: nobody cares that you don’t care.

It’s a forum, you’re gonna see stuff you don’t agree with. The fact that you made a post about it tells me you care a lot. 

Grow up."
La_bum,"This is not an unpopular opinion, this is a moronic opinion. Of course the BSG should know if somebody does not want to play the game anymore and why. Especially if its a major issues that a lot of people keep talking about and quitting the game for. 

Fanboys like you is what ruins most games. WOT being a perfect example of fanatical idiots who just kept saying we dont care about you not playing and ending up with a dead gold/creep based game that is now nowhere near as fun or popular as it once was. 

The hope of some people is to make this game better. If people dont wanna play the game anymore, BSG should know why, even if its a wall of text rant. Your goal is to be the most famous  BSG meat rider in all the land.  The information that they give can make the game better, the information that you give does not.

I hope BSG does care if people no longer wanna play the game and start fixing stuff (ESPECIALLY THE HACKERS/CHEATERS) before their game dies and i hope the players which left that make our community see the reasons to come back. I feel bad that we lost them and any sane player should."
Goyu,Popular opinion: no one cares that you don't care.
nlewis4,Willing to bet that 99% of people saying they are quitting do not quit.
carjiga,"Welcome to reddit where people go to try to grab some form of validation for any and every action they make.

and all of us who like to watch and comment ""we dont care"""
KnickCage,ok but it's important for the devs to see that people are leaving and why they are
TheOrigamiGuru,Well said!! Now excuse me while I overanalyze what you've said so I can complain about it...
Hizliz,Unpopular Opinion: No one cares that no one cares.
Gorgonite-Scum,"I understand frustration with the game and stuff. A lot of it is valid criticism. But what I don't understand is the constant need to post how upset you are with the game. Like, if  you don't want to play it, don't. That's really all there is to it."
Picinorg,I think your being an ass about it as people agree and we know it. shit has gotten to slide for too long and now people are finally just quitting But they dont want to as this game was rewarding.
dagobert-dogburglar,Unpopular opinion: nobody cares that you don't care that they're quitting tarkov. What are you really trying to convey here besides complaining? genuinely.
lessthandandy,"Opinion of unknown regard: if they played the game, and are making their opinion known because they believe that the game could have been for them, then we should at least entertain the possibility that it is valid, or even possibly constructive.

The only time I'd say someone's opinion doesn't or couldn't matter is if the game was a complete write off for them from the word go, and if someone is quitting and feels strongly enough to vocalize why, this is *probably* not the case. Where you sit in regards to their opinion beyond this is entirely pointless, the fact they are going to stop playing doesn't make your opinion more valid, much less your opinion of theirs."
,"""No one cares"" *procedes to list everyone who cares*
L post"
gen_adams,"now you see this is it: **they should.**

&#x200B;

I am sick and fucking tired of new players defending this game with literally 20 hours on it, living in a thick cloud of pink mist thinking the game is excellent. Of fucking course it seems great and free of flaws, you have yet to have been killed a thousand fucking times by the same bullshit broken netcode problem/game bug or a cheater, so you love it *for now*."
Nyarus15,This post made me realize just how cold the redditors are towards the community. I am now quitting eft forever until you rehab.
Epinephrine186,"I don't care that you don't care. You're literally just as bad as them. Man's actually said unpopular opinion.... I got a popular opinion for ya, nobody likes you."
,Very Popular Fact: You cared enough to make this post you cuck
Ovnii3,I care
Sm0kebringer,The worst part are the ppl who left nor doesnt play and still spitting on the game like their lives depend on it.
MenaBeast,Haha most popular opinion no doubt.
Dyils,"This again?

Unpopular opinion: Every single time someone makes a post like this or about how every  post is complaints, they are doing something counter-productive for us. Ironically, it's those that complain that are actually doing something productive.

Do you seriously not understand how if we were silent about the issues of the game, even less would get fixed and done? This is the only way we, as players, have to influence things. We've literally gotten players unbanned and some changes reverted by crying out loud about them long enough.

People aren't doing it for you. It's kind of ironic actually but... Nobody cares that you don't care.

These posts are a **good** thing. The more people post them and especially, the more people actually go through with it, the better. Even if BSG has already taken their money, they still care about their game. I firmly believe that their faults are not due to malice, but rather due to pure incompetence. So it's not like they don't want to fix the issues, they are just not good at 1) prioritizing correctly and 2) actually making good decisions.

So taking that into consideration, I **do** care that the community is vocal about their displeasure. It might just seem like a negative environment to you, but to me, it's an environment that's pushing for positive changes. Now, of course, many posts don't actually provide good structured feedback, but are just rants. But even those further enforce the need for various improvements and give more visibility to serious issues.

There's a reason BSG actually communicated their priorities on Twitter recently, which is very unlike them... people have been complaining about lack of communication for a long time. They did it to appease us, so clearly complaining works."
KerbalFrog,"I used to see posts like this, with no one cares you are elaving and bla bla bla, and now all thoes games are dead, because the comunity fails to stand up to bad development, and white knights only think about there experience. I could be here saying my nasa computer runs streets just fine, but i still find it unaceptable the state it was realeased in for 90% of the community.

I do care if you are quiting."
Kerstekind,"I care about people quitting. The more people quit, the bigger the chance that things will finally be fixed. Either that or daddy Nikita has too big of an ego and just watched the sinking ship, well, sink completely. I'm betting it's the last one seeing how his current priorities are being the 'baddie' in irrelevant EFT skits on YouTube.

What I couldn't care less about are the karma-seeking attention whores who think they're hot shit by posting ""unpopular opinion: nobobdy cares you quit - well, not really unpopular since I'm so full of myself that I think that everyone has the same opinion as I do - also lmao of course I care, I create a whole ass post about people quitting so there's that"".

You are an immature child and also one of the main problems why this game has gone down the shitter in the last couple of years. Probably also the first to downplay the current hacking going on, and other ACTUAL unpopular opinions. Of course you know exactly what you're doing, and only say the dumb shit that you're saying because you like the attention you'll get from it, even though you don't believe a word of what you're typing on this garbage sub.

I really hope you find some joy in your miserable life, but I've seen plenty of manbabies like you so I know it'll never come. Have fun on your trashy game and doing the same thing over and over and over again every 6 months, just under worse conditions every time (your own fault for d-sucking BSG/Nikita). Peace out! And for the love of God, don't reply to me. This isn't an open invitation to have yet another long, useless discussion with another Reddit neckbeard."
TwistedTreelineScrub,"No one gives a shit that a rando is quitting. The point of those posts is to explain WHY they are quitting, which could very well be something a lot of people care about.

The post can serve as a point of discussions on issues with the game and possible improments. Whereas this post is just complaining. There isn't anything to discuss. You don't have any points. It's just you dropping your feelings like a hairball in the middle of the room.

Personally I think this post should be removed because it violates Community Rule #2: No Rants or Complaints Posts without substance. I could be wrong, but in any case I feel like posts like this only contribute negatively.

P.S. Don't try to pass this off as just an apppreciation post either. That would have been fine. But this is clearly just complaining about other people on this subreddit. It's toxic and should be removed."
Dear_Living_8141,This is actually a popular opinion
egof1st,okey
UnlikelyCalendar6227,I care. The more players quit the better the servers get
gnurensohn,So true. I don’t get why people post „I quit“ here like why should we care lol
Fazgo,It's supposed to show the **devs** that sentiment is reaching a point where people are so enraged with the game they used to like that they quit it. Nobody cares about your opinion on this lol
TacticalBill,"Really popular opinion: all of these posts about quitting and complaining about people quitting are fucking stupid and pointless for the sub.

This sub strays further from the light every day lmao"
ATrueHunter,Based.
Dackyboi,Amen.
bufandatl,"I quitted the game last night. I clicked on exit. Then yes. Then I went to the lower left corner where the windows flag is. Clicked there. Selected this power button icon and clicked shutdown. 

Was such a relieve. Finally to go to bed. 

Hope you didn’t enjoy a single second of me quitting. See ya‘ in raid tonight."
Chiddles182,OP is right
Kuhaku-boss,Is more about me dont liking that 90% of gaming companies nowadays try to push shit through my throat because others like it and pretend im the bad guy for no wanting it and asking for better.
ranthasrabies,"Couldn't agree more. I also dont understand why half the comments are sour you are pointing out how tedious it is to scroll past all these posts and imply you care enough to make a post. It's all so annoying.

To everyone who is quitting, take as much of your stash as you can into your next few games to give it all away. I know you won't."
kaibtw,No one cares that you don't care you're equally as unimportant as the rest of us
Odd-Accountant3672,Get this man a truck stop hooker he gets it
thestructuresguy,"This exactly.  The worst thing that ever happened to me with regard to Tarkov isnt the desync, or the audio, or the hackers.  It was finding this fucking reddit.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy as this place."
ItsWugz,"I've encountered 1 potential cheater, and after review I really don't think they were cheating. Outrage marketing and whiney people are so loud its wild. The game isn't bad, it's being developed, if you don't like it play something else or go and create the perfect game that everyone who complains seems to know how to do. 

&#x200B;

To everyone quitting because of the ""state of tarkov"", ty, more loot 4 me :)

p.s if you aren't having fun I understand quitting, hope you find a gaming experience you enjoy <3"

Pills_in_tongues,"Well, perhaps you don't, but developers should. I quit because this situation is becoming unbearable, and the fact that BSG makes EFT Arena instead of fixing the core problems of their game that its still in Early Access is...not okay. Worst of all? At this point they are going to release Tarkov 2 and still be in Early access. Enjoy your game, I would like to, but I can't."
Beffanator,"You are right, BSG doesn’t care"
TheRealMicrowaveSafe,"Oh man, the timing of this being the second thread underneath the ""in memoriam"" thread above it. I know you never meant to include people who quit cause they died but damn that's some morbidly funny juxtaposition."
YoungBeamer,I normally play two wipes then quit then back for two wipes so naturally it just fell on this wipe I played til lvl 25 then quit just got bored
Phinvincible,When you tell people to leave if they don't like it: don't be surprised when they do.

IrregularrAF,I think EFT may be bigger than ever at this exact moment. I spent the first 3 weeks running into a scav every other game. Now the fucking scav army is damn near in every game.
Ther0,"I mean, sure, however : do you think that someone cares more about the fact that you don't  care ? Like... eh.

With that said quite often due to whatever reason we tend to ""dismiss the bad"" of whatever because we think ""it is what it is"", seeing a lot of people leaving might put a lot of stuff into perspective.

Also it is a good thing for the devs if they see that people quits this game because of certain issues.. at least the ones that they can fix in a rather timely fashion , like the pointless grind, the audio  (assuming it could be done to revert back to the previous audio), recoil or whatever."
ImBenCole,"Unpopular opinion but I don't want people to quit the game, I want a healthy population of players & new players to keep coming. I'm also interested in people's reasons behind quitting. You get some whiny idiots but some people have very valid points."

DisGruntledDraftsman,"Title is click bait, a lie, or just a moron that doesn't get it. 

There are many of us that care. It's comforting to know there are normal people that are fed up with the BS and are leaving. I keep asking myself, why do I play this game. I for one am almost done at this point. I don't plan on posting when I do quit but that's just me. Your opinion has no bearing if someone shouts it from the mountain or quits quietly. You are less relevant than those that have posted they are quitting."
Notjustanyman,"I do, don't list to OP."
PugstaBoi,I care if people leave because then the only people that are left are sweaters and hackers. And then the hackers push the sweaters away.

Dhczack,"False. More people playing ---> more Tarkov. Maybe you want to be a machismo asshole about it, but some of us actually care about people having a good time and seeing the game improve."
_THORONGIL_,"You shouldn't care about the specific person, but you should care in general when players leave a game you like. It's not doing the game any favors.

Fun fact: Nobody cares that you don't care, yet you felt the need to post your opinion on the matter. Thus... you do actually care."
xObiJuanKenobix,"You should care, you should be listening to why people are quitting and understanding why and being concerned. Remember, this is a multiplayer only game unless you play ""the mod"", so every person who leaves makes the game less popular and less able to be played. And when an absurd amount of issues are present that affect a huge variety of gamers, those people leaving start to add up.

\- People leaving because of cheaters

\- People leaving because the game is too grindy and unfun

\- People leaving because they don't have the time to play the game anymore, it's too much of an investment

\- People leaving because the gameplay itself is bad, like recoil and audio and desync

\- People leaving because their computers can't run the new maps and just the game overall because optimization is in the trash

\- People leaving because their favorite maps, like interchange and reserve, are hollow shells of their former selves.

\- People leaving because the developers are some of the worst communicators in history

\- People leaving because of the AI, getting 1 tapped by a toz scav from 200m away through 2 bushes

All these things add up over time, and if they aren't solved, the game just dies. Queue times increase, people don't want to invest so much time into it, and one by one more and more people leave. Especially when Streets, the map we've all been waiting for for over TWO ENTIRE YEARS is unplayable. Like they can't even bring people back in with the new content. Alongside that too, most people play with friends because it's more fun. If their friends leave, then they'll probably leave too."
DaPandaMau5,"I get that. I quit without really even telling anyone. I have people I played with asking me to hop on and I just make up excuses. Honestly just been casually playing pokemon and it's nice to go back to casual gaming. No worry about desync, hackers, grinding stupid quest keys to get 0.02 rep lol. I honestly forgot what it's like to just have fun in a game. And it's easy to type this all out but explaining it to people who are still in the hype of tarkov, I get that too. It's a great game. It used to be really fun for me and I won't talk them out of that. I want everyone to have that experience I remember. And I'm hoping that taking this huge break will allow me to come back and have that feeling again. But I've heard from a lot of people who have done that that it just makes them full commit to quitting. I hope that's not the case to me"
Mountain_Salt3613,"Let me bring to your attention h1z1, a great example of a game’s decline caused by developers refusing to consider that they could be doing something wrong: https://imgur.com/a/FzGXSYG

I don’t think the exact same thing will happen to EFT. They could still remain a great shooter simulator for gun enthusiasts with a smaller community. But that lack of communication and discussion between the devs and the community has already caused wonderful games to die drastically."
heyitzeaston,Noone cares if you care OP
ZOEGA-,Even more unpopular opinion: I enjoy the game despite its flaws and I support everyone's right to express what they want. If you don't like it then don't read it or downvote it
iKeeganHD,"Totally agree my man, but you have to remember that this subreddit is such a small part of the community that it makes up a tiny percentage of the player base, and even less so for the complaining posts. 

Best to just ignore them and remember how many people still play the game that aren’t on the Reddit, the player base isn’t going to be affected in any major way lol, it’s just people clutching their pearls thinking that them and a few friends quitting is going to have any impact. All a drop in the ocean my friend."
NUTTA_BUSTAH,But you still made a post about it. Begs to differ. The company producing the game cares about it too.
justwolt,I care
KappuccinoBoi,Best post here in a while. People get so self absorbed and feel the need to clog up new with shit no one else cares about. The thought that people think random strangers on the internet should give a single fuck about them and their gaming habits is mind-boggling.
Misterveri,Not caring enough to post about it nice.
brochochocho,"I don’t care if people are quitting but most of the quitting posts do actually disclose some legitimate gripe with the current state of the game. Most of these problems are not something you see in other games or even something that makes sense to have. 

I’m still baffled how we put up with issues that no other game would ever get away with. In no other game with this level of popularity have I seen desync so bad that players can be invisible to others, where people can run in place for everyone else while thinking they’re moving around the map, where you can have servers that disconnect the entire lobby, where the game launcher can just delete your hard drive contents out of the blue, where the game audio is so broken and misleading that you question your entire existence, where streamers can basically fast track player bans just because they want to. The list goes on and on and it’s an insane fact of this game. We’re all in this torture simulator putting up with hundreds of wasted time simply because the dopamine and adrenaline rush we get from playing. 

When someone says they’re done because they got extract camped or something that’s just the result of a dogshit segment of the playerbase, it’s whatever, but when it’s legitimate issues I think it’s fine to talk about it."
umopUpside,Unpopular Opinion: No one cares that you don’t care that other people are posting about quitting EFT.
CanadaSoonFree,"When you tell these same people that this sub, at best, makes up about 5% of the playerbase they can’t handle that information. 

There’s so many people playing and enjoying the game without even stopping by here or Twitter. Literally no one cares and you don’t have the impact you think you do."
MrMamba9000,Oh that’s it I’m quitting now
,[deleted]
bngson3,Im with you op 🥹
pti4ka1488,Better you don’t say that or else I will write you a spicy email regarding my concern. >:(
MrRainbowCow,I managed to quit last wipe but I was itching to go on this one
Syanth,I care
-ansr,No one cares if streamers quit either. I kinda wish they all quit actually
aztarky,"Attention seeking dbags. No one cares. More head, eyes for the rest of us."
pthumerianhollownull,I'm happy with the game.
CoatAlternative1771,"I just want to get to level 15.

Only 40k experience away…"
Thesaladman98,I don't care
FACEIT-InfinityG,Level of copium in this thread is strong.
TroleyWoW,Wait what are You saying! Im not a main character?
Firebase1,"Well it depends. If a very small percentage of players are leaving because of bogus issues like they can't get a kill or extract and are complaining about how hard the game is, that's one thing. But having a large number of the player base simply state the facts about how the game they paid for is plagued with issues and that their gameplay is more affected by said issues than their actual gameplay then that is something people, especially the devs, should care about. I have played since 2016, obviously had my fair share of bugs, but the last two wipes I haven't touched EFT. Development is supposed to move forward. Whatever your stance on the game it's hard to not say that their development process is two steps forward two or three steps back. This game has become little more than a bankroll for their next game (I forget what they call it) and at this stage EFT will never be released. I definitely will not be ordering the next BSG game purely based on their performance (or lack thereof) with Tarkov."
arct1ccz,I know one person who don't care because you have already paid. Our homeboy Nikita!
ShaddyDaShadow,"For someone pretending not to care, you seem to care a lot."
Yungterpintine,"I just quit bc I played my first raid and got head,eyesed! This game sucks! Back to Call of Booty for me. That game is so good. /s"
sleepy_the_fish,I do care about the games player count health hough. Levels 0 to 20 are way more brutal than it's ever been and it worries me that new players won't join even like a couple weeks after wipe Because it's too brutal
PlasticHistorical,"This sub is a cesspool. I'm only here for the rare posts with useful information about the game.

Things like best settings, tricks, youtube links that are relevant.

Mostly settings tweaks. 

Recoil? cheaters? desync? rubberbanding? I could give less than a fuck."
TheSwiggityBoot,"Damn games dying a ppl on reddit quitting left and right up and down 180 and 360, but if you look at this handy dandy website [https://mmostats.com/game/escape-from-tarkov](https://mmostats.com/game/escape-from-tarkov) it will show you yall weren't playing tarkov in the first place, just playing reddit bitch posting. Because for all these ppl that quit we still at 400k+ lol kinda shows me they weren't really even playing in the first place, just want to participate in reddit."
MyHouz,"Most folks who make those posts, myself included, know it makes no real difference.

Chances are most of us are looking to feel better about what we see as the slow death of one of our favorite games. 

I fucking hate the fact that I had to quit because of all the issues, especially sound, and sometimes it feels better to talk to other folks who feel the same."
crustysockmonster,Imagine caring about something lol *quietly sobs in the corner*
not_atwork,"I haven't quit but I'm definitely playing less. 

Also sounds like you definitely do care"
Bobby_Haman,"Doesn't care but felt compelled to come here and let everybody know.  Seems like it bothers you a little bit, which means you do care.  This post is a lie."
smittyK,I would argue that its a real popular opinion. No one cares
Harrysaches69,As a 15 year player of World of Warcraft. All I have to say is: first time?
happyimmigrant,"I used to play this game a fair bit. A pestily vid came up in my YouTube feed so I checked it out.

HOW ARE YOU GUYS PLAYING WITH THE SOUNDS LIKE THAT?"
wfd363,"“This isn’t an airport, no need to announce your departures”"
Chicano_TTV,FUCKING SPEAK TO THEM 🗣️
MrPatri0t,Nobody truly leaves. They all come back eventually.
amac109,"when using the idiom the correct term is ""tons"". ""tonnes"" refers to the metric unit of weight lol."
SovietVillageBoy,"100% with you. If you gonna quit, quit. We don't care for your reasons of why you hate the game. There are shit ton of people who enjoy the pain this game can cause. I love pain"
_Chizz_,Based
labelkills6287,Yup yup. Go play DMZ ya whiners
Lyesainer,"Then again, no one cares if you care about us quitting or not... 

So everything is fine, no need to talk more about it."
Wolf10k,They’re quitting and making an exit because they care about the game. They want to exit to be known so it’s added to the pile of people who quit. If that pile gets big enough you could reasonably say it’s a problem. Even if you are correct that it would have almost no effect for you.
sirchbuck,"Regardless the sentiments of the aforementioned people, EFT is going the way of PoE.  
 The results will speak for themselves"
Commando187,Unpopular opinion. No one cares if you dont care that people are quitting EFT.
NoTransportation7530, Hahahaha I’m dying just the notification of this on my phone has me dead
Iteroparous,Not unpopular at all
Hoofdkaal,"Guys this is an unpopular opinion: Everyone thinks this thing!!
Also also!!! This might not be an unpopular opinion..."
xCassiny,"Unpopular Opinion : No one cares that you don't care about people leaving the game while breathing copium and dampening huge flaws that should have been fixed by now.

I don't know if I should be more worried about the fact that you got 1.1k with such a twitterish title on a gaming subreddit or that some people agree with the actual sentence. Avid players are leaving because they don't see improvements in critical problems with the game and you're fully dicrediting them with such a post. But why score against your own goal like this?"
MidgardSG,I think that no one cares about that is a part of the problem with this game.
Positive_Insurance_5,"Ah yes, you enjoy that rng recoil, you enjoy walking with 30lbs of gear, you enjoy not being able to jump over a half a foot incline or a fence that should be able to be cleared by even a 10 year old. Enjoy bsg not respecting your time in and out of raid. Realism baby"
Vilesence,"I care and you do as well. We all care because the lobbies are gonna be empty. My guess is you never stuck through a whole wipe to see how sad it ends up. Empty lobbies, no players to fight, nothing to compete for."
b_fnk,I care for everyone that's quitting. Your opinion is truly unpopular by my standards.
elbingobonito,I care.
Mightypeon-1Tapss,Well you shouldn’t care about that specific person but you should care if the game is going in the wrong direction that makes people quit only if you care about the game’s future
MagicSceptre,"Nobody quits eft, everybody just says they are gonna quit eft for attention."
Redditisannoying69,First wipe I see lol
TimmeTehWise,"For me it's about making a statement, I don't really care what you think about me quitting either. All I hope to achieve with these statements is that if EFT's player count drops, they can see why people are quitting. It isn't for you, it's so that if by some miracle BSG checks their player's feedback they can see that there are issues. But that's just my take on these sorts of statements.

 Personally I'm leaving until they can improve servers or cheater detection, so that I don't need to worry about losing my EOD account based off some inconclusive streamer clip, that looks bad due to terrible dsync."
Weird-Phone3160,"And what happens if less people play the game? That's how a multiplayer game dies, you weed."
BernieSandals_m,I always think:  Good.  Maybe now I can scav into reserve in less than 10 minutes.
Ep1csh0tz,You making a post means you care. Negative feedback is what good games look at for changes. You obviously aren't a player that brings change.
FuzzySmile,"I definitely take long breaks from Tarkov, but I still continue to play it every wipe. I’m worried how Tarkov will turn out in the coming years, but even with all the flaws I’ll continue to play. Having to redo the tasks every wipe frustrates me the most though."
RonGirthquake,"""I don't care that you ~~broke your elbow~~ quit Tarkov."""
LogicalNorth,i don't care
TransportationNo1,"I hate single fire recoil.  
I hate the broken sound.  
I hate the non working sneaking.  
I FUCKING HATE the heavily increased cheating.

But you know what? I find my ways to have fun in this shitshow of a game, cause no game gives me the adrenalinspikes and the heartbeat like tarkov. <3"
pepthebaldfraud,"Yes it does, nobody likes dead raids and it happens earlier and earlier every wipe lol"
Shadowkrieger7,I care. Cause it might actually get attention and fix the fucking hackers/bugs.
DelugeFPS,"I think the recoil is absolutely in a bit of a funky position, our PMC's are a bit too pisswheat in the cardio department and the sound is in an absolutely fucked place right now.

BUT, this is still my favorite game, I love it and I'm not going to stop playing it because despite its flaws it just scratches an itch that no other game quite manages to do in the same way and that's with thousands of hours logged on various TacFPS and MILSIM titles running the gamut from Squad / Post Scriptum / Beyond the Wire / Project Reality / Hell Let Loose style games to the Rising Storm games (RS / RO is still my favorite strictly PvP focused TacFPS series, though) to police shooters like SWAT 3 & 4 and Ready or Not to games with phenomenal gunplay that blow Tarkov's out of the water like Ground Branch. Then we have obvious stuff like Arma, god, so many games in my library that fit under the tactical shooter / MILSIM genres.. plus a ton of actual simulators like DCS, Steel Beasts, IL2, etc. Not to mention the other actual extract shooters like Marauders.

And even out of all those games, none feel as satisfying and deep as Tarkov. For the aspects of Tarkov that are game-y, silly and unrealistic.. the overall package still gets closer to the real thing more than any other. This game has a way of getting my heart racing that no other game gets close to touching, and the paranoia / worry of there being eyes watching you no matter where you go is reminiscent of the time I spent deployed to Marjah (Afghanistan) in 2012 when I was an 0311 with 3/9. There's something Tarkov gets JUST right that really unlocks that sense of feeling like you're in a place where death could come from any direction and at any moment, and that every move you make needs to be practical and smart otherwise you put yourself in a situation you can't get out of.

There's a lot of other things on top of the immersive vibe Tarkov radiates (I should also mention I'm Ukrainian-American, I moved to the states at age 6) and the personal reminders of the post-Soviet haze of my home country that I enjoy too. There's a lot of games that compete for my attention in my various game libraries, and Tarkov is the one I come back to the most. All its problems aside, it's a great fucking game and for me, nothing else can touch it.. and believe me, I've tried just about EVERYTHING else there is. I have over 100 tactical shooter / MILSIM / etc games in my Steam library alone. There's nothing out there in the genre, even amongst the more indie titles (Easy Red 2, Black One Blood Brothers, WW1 Game Series, etc), that I haven't tried. Tarkov is still king above all of them."
AWOOGABARKMEOW,no one cares that u dont care😁😁
Liisn,"Doubt anyone cares about anything, unless it personally affects them or relates to them one way or another.

That being said, the motives lay towards the hopes and dreams that by mentioning they're quitting, there's a slither of chance that BSG will finally say ""blyat you know what, we're losing gamers left right and center. Perhaps it's time we actually fixed some of these issues""

Forget about it, gamers. If it's one thing I've learned from the gaming industry, it doesn't work that way. The game will be discarded or scrapped and made a-new before they fix the major issues of the game.

FYI, you guys knew nikita actually worked on 2-3 games before tarkov? Very similar, but more generic games such as cod? With weapon skins and fast-paced dying/reviving, etc.


Can't remember the names, but I'm sure you all have the ability to search and learn."
BroadStPhlyer,"I've been playing since 2018, I'm having more fun this wipe than any other wipe despite its many flaws. My only real gripe is audio, which is a given. I just kinda ""embrace the suck"" with everything else."
tiptotip,"On the contrary, I think this is a popular opinion."
Mockets,Probably should
AltruisticWelder4664,no one gives a shit about your opinion.
OCWBmusic,"Nobody besides BSG, of course."
S-96,This wipe I've been enjoying the game the most honestly
moose_338,You cared enough to make a post about it.
Magnar_The_Great,Trigger a large group of losers addicted to a video game any % speedrun.
a1mm_,"Hey guys I'm quitting the game, not that anyone needed to know but then again i expect you to agree with me and quit with me because my opinion and actions for the game should 100% be taken into consideration and you guys should quit with me!!!!11111111!!1!1!!!"
Mission-Savings7095,I swear all of you saying there is nothing wrong got no pattern recognition skill whatsoever. You just walk through your lives cluelessly like a neutered lapdog
Effective-Category86,10% might enjoy this game in its current state. And another 30% are cheaters that enjoy it as well. But 60% are pissed they've been lied to and ripped off by a bunch of fat Russian slobs that can't tie their own shoes let alone make a decent game. 6 yrs and have worse audio then in the beginning. Not to mention 27000 new and old bugs that have never been fixed.

Read this and it will tell you why tarkov will only go downhill as it has every wipe. BSG and Nikita are completely incompetent. And this wipe shows just how bad it is."
Nikovash,I care
D3_BellDropper69,Popular opinion
EliteEmber,Ngl this resonates a lot after reading that funeral post
YourAverageGiant6-6,"I dont think it's right to discredit someone in this way. 

In most cases, these people are veterans, with 100s of hours. Being driven out by BSG, and their incompetent game design. 

If anything, I feel like these posts are more than valid, but necessary for the game to improve. If BSG actually gives a damn about improving the game."
D0omzone67,This opinion is popular with me
somenoefromcanada38,I DONT CARE SO MUCH THAT I MADE A REDDIT POST SPECIFICALLY ABOUT IT!
Vexsanity,"You cared enough to make a post about it, ironic huh."
Leytarkhan,"The ammount of people that cant handle the valid criticisms people make about a game they paid money for is really bothering me and not just for this game.

  
People like you and many others on reddit always saying ""quit"" crying etc. are just not caring enough to actually want change to the state of the game and make the game better...

  
Also to add to this you can enjoy the game and still hate the absolut shit state it is in.

Can we please stop normalizing not ""crying"" about real problems games have and letting devs/studios get away with their poor work ethics and lack of care to the actual miserable state of their game ?"
Scribs645,This post makes me want to make a post about why I quit tarkov.  Tarkov is an awful game and an ok simulation of hell.
LOOP16,"Dude no one cares…


*writes Reddit post*


(Fr tho I have no opinion I wanna get into tarkov but it seems unplayable rn)"
SteadyDJ516,But see the devs do and they Care about your input and what you think they could do better and if there's minor adjustment or tweaks then can do to make the game better as a whole
Alex13445678,Fr
