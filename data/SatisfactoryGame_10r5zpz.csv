Awes0meEman,Pretty sure it's bright white to prevent employees wasting time shopping when they should be working.
Valdrax,"Eye-searing bright white backgrounds perfectly fit the soulless corporate store feel, though.

What are you, a night person?  Get to work."
OmegaSevenX,QA site would be a better place for suggestions. Devs aren't looking here for them.
LifeupOmega,"*flashbang* 
Welcome back, FICSIT Employee."
CursedFrostbite,Can we please add 500% brightness to the AWESOME shop!
darkthought,"No, no no... can we BUY dark mode for the awesome shop"
Matix777,Make it unlockable for like a 100 tickets :D
CockroachGullible652,Ficsit funded studies have shown that bright lights increase productivity.
ANGR1ST,How often are you looking at the shop that this is a problem?
AlexStarkiller20,Itâ€™s to keep you awake to prevent accidents and improve work time! Now hop to it
Haki23,For 10 tickets you can have 1 month of night mode. Get crackin!
Ender_teenet,"Ok, I read a section and I will try making mod to BUY dark theme for unfixed price"
GenexenAlt,"FICSIT: Absolutely! 

&#x200B;

That'll be 150 AWESOME tickets please"
RMSHN,"It's a good idea but I'm shocked that noone said that you have a graphic bug on the screenshot - your shadows are black as hell. It's a well-known bug that can be fixed by reloading the game. Usually reloading helps to me if I play \~10 mins (or till daylight in the game) and reload then. I will post my screenshots before and after right now (just finally made it few days ago), so, check out the feed.

UPD: done: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/10rmwll/before\_and\_after\_reloading\_the\_game\_to\_fix\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/10rmwll/before_and_after_reloading_the_game_to_fix_that/) \- check both screenshots to feel the difference.

So in this case it looks not so contrast and the dark skin is not so necessary."
ByoByoxInCrox,Ficsit is not responsible for any damage done to the cornea caused by irresponsible use of their website.
A_Rave-ing_Zektrus,No! Awesome shop is AWESOME! And it isn't going to simmer down for anyone.
jorn86,Can we please do things that'll actually matter to the game's quality instead
CadencyAMG,mobile optimization as well
domtt,REALLLL
Jonah-1903,That will be 10 tickets sir
Jonah-1903,That will be 10 tickets sir
involviert,I wish it remembered where I scrolled. Really clumsy when you select something and then go back to that page for something else.
I-dont-help,I want a solarized dark theme like texteditors have.
ThomasDePraetere,Perhaps you could buy it
Virgurilla,But make it purchaseable
KretzKid,This would be a great post for their forum
Saaihead,"First, I can't see how this is a priority above fixing actual bugs and finishing the game. Second, how much time do you spend in the shop for this to be a problem? After unlocking everything there is nothing to do here, besides wasting tickets on stuff you could produce yourself."
