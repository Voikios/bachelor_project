Citizen-Kang,"If I could make THAT kind of money for a dance that lasts a few minutes...I'd consider it...  No shame in your game, Mario.  Work what you got; all honest work is honorable work."
HolycommentMattman,"This post makes no sense. Fewer and fewer people are going to trade schools; we're basically going to run out of plumbers. And on top of that, the Mushroom Kingdom has more plumbing than NYC. Mario's gonna be in work for decades, and can probably name his price. 

So he had to resort to stripping? Don't be ridiculous. He's clearly stripping because he truly enjoys it."
