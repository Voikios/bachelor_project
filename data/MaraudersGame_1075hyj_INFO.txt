{"Title": "Suggestions to the Devs.", "Post Text": "I came up with some suggestions to share with the Devs. Hopefully some of these are worthwhile additions.\n\n1. The MG-42 should have a suppression mechanic, wherein the player getting shot drops all their loot and surrenders immediately. It's tedious to use up its ammo just to get a kill.\n2. The PPSH should have a fear mechanic when fighting Commandos and players using the Central Empire voice-lines, because they remember Stalingrad.\n3. All Beret-clad SAS operatives should have their weapons replaced with bagpipes that give an accuracy bonus to the Bren and Tommy gun soldiers.\n4. Prisoners should have a chance to drop pruno. Prison Pizza and Correctional Cake are acceptable alternatives.\n5. Players using the M-16 should have a 5% chance to hear Vietnamese in the rafters and spontaneously empty their magazine. \n6. As per its real life counterpart, the Cobray Terminator should never fire and should be worth negative space bucks upon being sold.\n7. The model of the Krasa's magazine does not function as intended upon being reloaded. It should, ideally, be touching the ground.\n8. Use of the Trench Gun should result in sanctions by the Central Empire as using this type of weapon constitutes a war crime.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not need to be credited if any or all of these changes are implemented. I do it for the love of the game.", "ID": "1075hyj", "Score": 43, "Total Comments": 9, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/1075hyj/suggestions_to_the_devs/"}
