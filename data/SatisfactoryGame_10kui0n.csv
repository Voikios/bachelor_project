No_Description3394,It takes me 15 minutes to just remember what I was working on last.
Alfonson,"when you log in after a long day at work and realize what your current project is and you know you won't have the energy to get any of it done today.

Or if you just want to slide through your factory for a bit to enjoy your creatings"
houghi,"15 minutes is starting the game, doing a save and closing it again, so yes, in theory you could do it. The real question is ""Are you personally able to do it?"" That I can only answer when I stop playing my first session and start a second one and then close that."
Pakspul,From Saturday 10:00 till Sunday 10:15 counts as 15minutes?
Potential_Copy27,"*Do I?*  
Not often - mostly I sit building/extending on my main playthrough for a few hours.

*Can I?*  
It happens that I think up some simple build tricks, configurations or improvements and try it out just for fun, or if I just want to marvel at it for a few minutes.

Rarely it happens a friend asks me how I did XYZ and I just hop in to show them.

Though since update 7 came out, i've considered starting again from scratch with the stuff i've learned lurking on this sub, while keeping it all a bit more aesthetic ;-)"
skunk_jumper,The 15 minute or less sessions are when the game crashes due to mods.
Zen_360,"I feel like you need at least 2.5 to 3 hrs of time, to make it a satisfying session. The hours just fly by..."
GrumpyDim,"Launch the game, load save, look at spaghettis, alt + f4"
fuesselpueh,"Log in --> \*sees all the mess I've done\* --> not today --> log out. 

Quiet easy"
Mr0bviouslyInsane,"More like 4-6+hours a sitting, depending on what it is I'm doing at the time."
Grojen,I just started playing last night. I blinked and 45 minutes had passed. Dunno how you can do only 15 mins.
The_Pastmaster,Well. The question is CAN you play it for 15 minutes.  I would say yes but my own sessions are much longer.
RMSHN,"Those people who can use the ""save"" function any time 😉"
PyroYeet0808,Less than 15 hours yes
KillAllTheThings,25% is the number of people who can't answer poll questions correctly. This applies to all polls.
Cobradaddy,"Log in to collect Xmas gifts, cover eyes, log out. 

Log in, check power usage, fuse blown, log out. Lol"
vadium,"OP, it’s really easy, I was bonked from a cliff by a hog on my second start of this game. I was so frustrated, I immediately alt-f4"
Raged_Coconut,I have a factory cart skatepark so I can understand where that came from
Zelmi,"As a newbie in the game, I can honestly play 15 minutes, achieve a small objective and logoff. By small objective I mean create a few buildings to craft new parts, go to a closeby site I want to mine and be sure I have everything I need to start."
pootis_panser_here,That be me. I get on thinking I can restart the game after an update. Then getting discouraged.
Commissarfluffybutt,Check on production for 15 minutes then go afk for the night and let the machines work.
Weak-Fortune4255,i only play for 15 mins the reason? **TOO FU- LOUD PC AND SUPERHEATED PLASMA PC**
Mday89,"I just became a dad, and this is the reason I'm not touching this game until my little one is at least 6 months..."
Slow-Protection9490,It take me 15 Min to work out what I'm going to do
Sylar299,I mean I just got back from work and it feels like it's been fifteen minutes. Why is the sun rising tho ?
The_Alphacheese,It takes me 15 mins to prioritise what project I need to do lol
US_Dept_of_Defence,"When you haven't logged in a hot minute and realize you were in the middle of fixing your spaghetti. Overwhelmed, you decide to log off and leave that for the next time."
GallantGentleman,"At times. Especially when I'm tired I will sometimes log on, do a bit of work, bit of decorating, bit of shifting materials around and then realize I'm in no position to start working on those 3 oil wells, save and exit..."
Plenty_Palpitation56,"Log in, take 15 minutes to look round, close satisfactory, open Excel, design factory"
factoid_,"Well you certainly CAN play for 15 minutes.

Some games have arbitrary play length restrictions where you can't really advance the game in under a certain amount of time.   Satisfactory has no such mechanism. So if you need to out the game down after 15 minutes you can save, exit and lose nothing.

However I'd definitely accept the argument that you can't get a lot of meaningful work done in this game in just 15 minutes.

Maybe this is less true after blueprints were added, but I feel like unless you're doing something very small, 15 minutes isn't enough time."
occupyOneillrings,"I mean you can, not that most people do. Compared to many other multiplayer games where one session can take from 20-60min. You could leave in the middle of the game, but you would then forfeit the game and possibly fuck over your teammates.

The question is a bit badly phrased though if most people misunderstood it, the correct answer should objectively be  ""yes"", you can play for 15min, save and then continue without problem. Can't do that for a large number of games."
JustSomeDudeItWas,"Ever log in, look at your spaghetti, realize there's no fixing this mess, and call it a day?"
ToughCurrent8487,"I love Satisfactory but this is the main reason I don’t play it often, I need to know I have the next 6 hours free before I start playing because it sucks me in that hard"
bouchard,"Maybe they misread it as ""15 hours""?"
hetrax,"100% me, depression has me hard lately and I hop into the game, see my current task and go”ah… right okay so… later…” after trying to continue on. 100% believe those are the 15 minute people!"
rexxar155,I log in and my computer starts heating up while loading my factory and I start accepting the fact that I'll crash soon...
Molwar,"While I wouldn't mark yes, I've played 15min and just walked away leaving the game on while I check on my toddler, come back another 15min, go back do something else lol."
jgDarkness,They should have asked about days instead of minutes.
Staterae,"Some of the survey questions that Epic asks about games are wildly inapplicable so I figure people click randomly.

See also classic [West Wing](https://youtu.be/YYBWX6Cdv5I) on survey respondents."
Katana_sized_banana,"It's because of the long auto save after every 15 minutes. Some can go get a coffee while waiting, so technically they play only ever 15 minutes at a time."
Party_Magician,"Me, when get on, spend 10 minutes in the codex looking through things I need for phase 4, and then close the game to go watch youtube"
EngineerInTheMachine,"Probably during a boring Teams meeting. No, I've never done this. Honest!"
th3ramr0d,That’s about how long it takes me to realize I’m out of my league
Terrorscream,who people who have poor computers that give them an overheat time limit :P
DemogorgonWhite,"I mean... it is doable. There are times when I load my save to just set up quick thing or open the Hard Drive before going to work.   


But I can't say it is the way to play that game."
EchoMB,"Getting down basic iron production, sure. Anything past that? 5+ hours MINIMUM"
agent_double_oh_pi,Rage quits
Oldenodd,"I *can*, but don't. And don't want to."
Fkeolciuxr,Start the game > remember that you need to make the battery factory > check schematics > get overhelmed > leave > repeat few hours later/next day
DdfdKing,I mean my computer dies after just turning on the game
NiSiSuinegEht,"Zero minutes is less than fifteen, and I am fully capable of getting in a zero minute play session every morning before work..."
wtfawk55,Married male players....
alphawarframe,"Me. It's for a couple reasons - 1) it's in early access and I personally don't like to dedicate TOO much time until final release and 2) I love that I can get a dopamine hit in this game by simple progressing and feeling good about one thing, like, I am new and I can't tell you how good it felt to build a miner, smelter and prodcution machine with power and belts into a container and have it *work*"
Roseknight888,"I'd say an hour a day would be a perfectly reasonable game play loop though, spend an hour setting up or polishing a production line, or spend an hour exploring to find some resources"
YouChooseWisely,The question is CAN not will. I can start it up and 10 minutes later get a call that needs me to leave and attend a urgent matter so it can be a less than 15 minute session.
LegendaryJimBob,"The people that go play for 15mins and realice that was 12 hours ago but dont want to risk anyone finding out, or maybe its just me"
FreshPitch6026,It only means people think you CAN plsy it 15 mins at a time. Because you can always save.
cchooper1,My 6 yo daughter that runs around and collects slugs.
TheRealMicrowaveSafe,"Depressed people. Think about playing all day/week, finally hop on, accomplish nothing for 15 mins, then shut down your whole PC and only semi consciously browse reddit until it's time to rinse and repeat. 

I mean, uhhhh, so I've heard from, uhhhhhh, friends."
kaminsod1,"I often barely make it to 15 minutes.
I love the game but a few patches ago they changed something and since then i get terrible motion sickness."
wigglex5plusyeah,Larger tasks are just a series of smaller tasks. There is much that can be done in 15 minutes.
Pyra_Firestone,When it takes me 15 minutes to figure out how many hours it's gonna take me to get anything done then logging off.
Nine-LifedEnchanter,"14 minutes to startup, one minute of freezing before crashing."
TheSwankyDollar,Maybe Modders that are checking if their stuff works????
DiabolicallyRandom,"I run a dedicated server, so sometimes 15 minutes is logging in to check on things, make sure its all good, grabbing my tickets and if I have enough, purchasing a statue lol."
ianacook,"Nobody said they DO, just that you COULD. There's no timed mechanic or imposed goal that requires longer at one time. So maybe the responders were just being literal."
Riunix,What Can happen and what Does happen are not necessarily the same thing.
ShadowRam,Parents
Sudhanva_Kote,15 mins is how much time i need to remember what are the things I need to do. Then I'll decide that it will take like 5 hrs to do that (probably 15 to be honest) and I don't have that kind of time. So I log off and do something else. Usually I play for like 30 mins and log off. But sometimes I'm tired to do that as well. So I watch some YT or something and go to sleep
Relevant-Bed4875,I literally did that an hour ago. Played for about 15 minutes before I had to leave to catch a bus. Wanted to play a bit because won’t be able to for a while. Thought I could do something productive. Ended up just flying and sliding around my base…
Flirie,Seems like only 4 people voted
Deaboy,"I’m actually one of the people who would vote “Yes” here. The trick was only playing for 10-20 minutes in the morning before work, and having a comprehensive step-by-step todo list (external to the game) with tasks broken down into small steps. Then, when logging in each morning with my coffee, I just reference the list and do as it says. Sometimes I spend a few minutes adding more tasks to the list for future days.

For example, instead of overbroad tasks like “build more furnaces”, I would break it down into 5 minute steps: “calculate number of machines for X output” > “choose suitable location for X factory” > “gather building supplies for X factory”, etc."
Stickel,"impossible for me, I quit playing right b4 Update 3, so I can't wait until full release to play again, but yeah, even then, 15 minutes? Like that's not even one job needing to be done lol... 

I didn't use trains what soever so I just had tracks everywhere... No way I did any one step in 15 minutes or less, lol"
Commander_IF,"Who's not playing more than an hour, during school break i clocked 5–7 hours."
playr_4,"It's the people who load in, realize they were working on an hmf factory, wander around it for a bit, sigh and leave."
bzjeep,"I typically have found that anything less than an hour is difficult to accomplish anything once you're a ways into the game; however, I started a new factory last night and ended after hooking up the first section of iron and copper smelters/constructors only to realize that I had forgotten that I can do 2:1 for rods and wire, so this morning while I was waiting to take my kids to school, I hopped on for about 20 or so minutes to build out the rest of the constructors."
TheXtrafresh,"Sorry, I read wrong, I thought it was 15 hours.

...

Still voted No.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)"
Neo14515,"Hi, it seems I am one of the 25%"
Sloopy_DE,"you CAN play it in 15 min sessions, right. If it makes any sense is a completely different question."
Triggerunhappy,"I get a glass of water
I sit
Game loads
I play 10 min
Kids start fighting crying or other
I get up and deal"
W34kness,"Ya that’s gonna be a no for me, it’s going to take 15 just to recap the last session and maybe even another 15 to start plans on what today’s will be about"
glorwen,They are definitely serial killers
ObamasBoss,Some times I just want to bash one of those turtle giraffes and leave.
moebelhausmann,"Liars. And lizzard doggos. The log on, collect 1 nuclear waste and leave again"
MonsieurKas,Mostly killers and rapists.
Some_Neck_9205,Me. The game crashes
Broote,"Load up the game, look around at all the work you have to do to fix your garbage factory, log out.   15 minutes."
krazyjakee,In satisfactory time that's like 4 seconds wtf?
dandab,It took me a good 15 minutes to figure out how the pipe flow mechanics worked.
LionMcTastic,Adults with responsibilities
Smarteyes007,It takes me fifteen minutes to put things into my inventory that I need to take to my other factory to build a train that takes those things to that factory automatically.
SkylarFlare,There are DOZENS of us
KittenMittons2190,The only way I can play this game for 15 minutes is if I’m forced to by my little 1 year old monster refusing to take a nap.
Skullz64,Modders who use creative mode mods
ultimatefish67,"It’s those of us who have newborn children… I would guess those of us with more than one kid and a newborn. This season of life can be rather…. Difficult to get time to yourself or plan, just about anything with consistency."
phlevel15,You turn it on and walk away for a day to let everything back up and/or sink
Decent-Strain-1645,Idk. I have to go at least an hour each session minimum. Otherwise I think about what I should have optimized or what biome I should have explored the rest of the day.
Zernder,"Me opening the game, getting all excited and starting a new factory. Getting to tier one and realizing how horrible the biomass burners are AGAIN. Quiting and going back to factorio."
Ultimate_905,How on earth can anyone only play for 15 minutes?
Human-lTy,"After I boot up the game I have to boot up my brain.
I go hardcore AFK. Probably 60% of my total game play is AFK. Then I dip in at intervals which probably could be 15, 20,...45 minutes"
Foxhighlord,"I once spent 3 hours calculating and planning a factory. Nothing was built, only thought about."
razz13,"I fire up the game, realise what an absolutely massive journey is ahead, get overwhelmed and switch it off"
giantvar,I play 10 mins at a time its too boring for me
kirigerKairen,"I mean, I guess it is *possible*…"
ondrejeder,"Sure, I'll take 10 of those 15mins sessions at a time"
Fetty24,Kids. Those people have kids.
Trigga1976,"15 minutes! I sit down to play on a Friday night, next thing the family are getting up on Saturday morning."
wallofchaos,Used to take 5 of those minutes to load the game. Then I moved it to my SSD. Wow. I played this since day one till this week on a HDD.  How? It's soooo slow.
MightyDumbleDork,I guess 25% of players returned the game.
MobiusDT,"Could you? Technically.  


Will you ever? No."
Kultrip,"it doesn’t ask “do you” it asks “can you” which you very much can, you just won’t actually do anything besides like, run around a bit confused"
Magnesiumbox,"Can you accomplish anything in 15 minutes? No.  
Could you theoretically log in and ""play"" for 15 minutes and then log out? Absolutely"
alexennerfelt,I have never done less than 3 hours
Kevin-Son-of-Dad,It always starts with the intention of 10 or 15 minutes and ends with me being asleep at my desk 3 days later...
SetriKid,"15 minutes is me setting up a building site, going back to my base to get resources, back to the build site, realize I forgot half of what I need, back to my base, and rinse and repeat for about 15 minutes."
illumas,"ADHD. I do 15 minutes of project A, get distracted, find funny reddit post....fall down rabbit hole, remember I was doing something, start new project ... Repeat until nuclear power"
ath0rus,i load it up and say lets have  quick game (less then 15 mins) i look at the clock and it has been at least 30 mins
TemplaerDude,"Me, sadly. I have a young infant and you gotta get what time you can. Changes the way I've played the game, I go in knowing exactly what I want to accomplish in my limited time."
BrofessorFarnsworth,Dads
killer_queen_87,like you can play for 15 minuets but you wont get anything done
S4zuck,"Hey, I said you could, not that that's what i do."
Gearfree,"It's not that folks play in 15 minute segments, but that some find that they can be play in smaller chunks.
I do that some times when there's a small bit of extra time before heading off to work for the day.

Like loading it up to finish up a small detail or getting something rolling and leaving your pov aimed at what you want to continue with on reload.

How many open world games save what your viewing angle was?"
Pen4711,That's about how long I play and realize I just don't have the amount of time this game requires. haha
Acrobatic-Truth,Those who click play but never launch the game due to shit PC
Top_Time_Square,I usually play for about 20 minutes then idle while i try to figure something out or remember what i was doing then repeat
Alpheus2,"Log in, slide and zoop around my factory.

Find a factory problem I was workin-

oh baby is crying."
Gorione,"Shoot, it took 15 minutes to figure controls, get the layout of the game, etc.

I'm calling shenanigans on those 25%."
Coolbule64,The ones that crash and give up right now :(
UristImiknorris,"I can, but I don't. I think the only time I played this game for 15 minutes or less was right before work one day, when I started the game, loaded up my inventory, drove to the site I wanted to build a new facility at, and dropped a sign down in front of me to remind me what I was going to do there (it was a diluted fuel power plant in the desert canyons)."
Konowl,I legit fire it up 15 mins sometimes for boring meetings and will work on cosmetic fidly things.
iwftc,"I can honestly say that lately, I'm in the 15 minute category. Now let me explain. 

I haven't played since update four. When I last played, I had permaday (and some other mod on). I didn't make a ""pre-mod"" save, so all my auto saves have the mods in them. I really want to get back into the game, but starting over is so daunting.

I browse this subreddit and think how awesome it would be to have the materials to build the awesome structures you have (but ultimately implementation never looks like what it did in my head). So I log in for 15 minutes, realize I have nowhere near what I did with mods. I have mk 1 miners with a single belt and no storage and then I log off thinking of what could have been had I never enabled mods... Or had that pre-mod save. 

So intimidating playing now, especially starting over!"
DiamondExcavater,15 min to turn on the game and collect tickets and then leave the computer afk to get more tickets later?
1Th3Gentl3man,"I sometimes just open my excel sheet and satisfactory calculator and imagine the future plans. This game is on my mind in the bus, during meals etc. i play this game more during off screen time than when i actually play it lol"
