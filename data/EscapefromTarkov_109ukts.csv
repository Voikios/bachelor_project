Joie116,Repairing these things is giving mad intellect and maintenance skill
DJDemyan,"Dude I love new hodge podge guns they have. PP19 with an AK grip, busted ak74 with a red dot, it actually feels like they're going around cobbling guns together as one would in this kinda situation"
zollie20, because its a great fuckin change and we come here to complain
sushirolldeleter,Getting loot from raids **should** be one of if not the main source of getting items needed.  Moving gear from traders to raids will put more people on maps and create more action.
ThePatchelist,"The weapon durability change is REALLY fucking good. So good, they'll probably change that, or rather nerf it.

It's literally free weapons that are actually usable for a while.

The loot I have not noticed yet, but if it's the case it makes sense and is a neat addition."
KevitoMG,I was planning to do a VSS run soon. Haven‘t even finished the thought before I killed a scav running a VSS. Repaired it and here we go.
Killermen962,The gun mods I've seen on scav guns so far are the most diverse I've ever seen since alpha. I've come across a variety of AKs and their modding can be pretty extensive from their base. I found a ak-74n that looked like the 366 Molot vpo rifle you'd find off a Reshala guard for example. The loot these scavs have top down is the best I've seen thus far and feels like each gun they drop is much more.... personal to them with things they found.
DraveMelon,"yeah Ive bought only a few guns since the change. I just take the scav weapons, repair then use them, Havent run into a single malfunction with those but the old 50 durability max weapons used to break all the time."
TheLoneAce,"It's because no one wants to praise something that is good, only want to complain about the game and that's it. 

You shouldn't have told anyone cause that's how I was getting my guns!!!"
OlDirty420,"I noticed this too and thought I was going crazy lol. I'm seeing more random loot on scavs including the occasional nice weapon (found a decked out m870 on one that wasn't from a player, still FIR) and the shitty weapons are broken but can be repaired. Weapons seem to lose durability quicker too, managed to whittle down an mp443 to 15% after just a few raids"
Jamieargh,"Yeah, its wild. I got a Gingy Keychain from a Scav on LH"
DeckerR,"Its probably a bug, honestly"
Conserliberaltarian,"Looted an ai scavs on factory that had a FULL MBSS of loot! Every single slot was filled, and he had a flash drive!"
Dildosauruss,Their pockets and backpacks had chance to have stuff for as long as i remember?
Ravoracious,Only took BSG 7 years to pump this one out boys. Maybe in 5 more they'll managed to fix the audio issues.
Arc80,I don't get why no one's talking about the lack of post raid stats on scav raids. My last 6 or so have not had any stats screen for whatever reason.
SnakeSkinBots,Yo I heard they added loot back to the game.  Is it true?
Achillies2heel,The 20 minute SCAV Queue times are a deal breaker
anacleto_etd,"The scav changes and the player scav changes are golden, my friend got a FLIR from a scav, and I spawned as a player scav with a fucking leddy, its insane"
Destgamez,"It’s amazing, my friend got a short shotgun with a short grip that had 2 optics on it. It was so funny seeing that. I also got a pretty kitted ak74u one time. Love this scav change can’t wait to see what I get next."
SadError01,"When I killed a scav I thought it was a real player because it was kitted pretty heavily, got Lotta cool shit off it then died by players lmao"
Hairy_Flatworm_427,"Unfortunately, this change was applied to rogues as well. I can't sell a lot of their weapons now because they're around 50 durability, but their max durability is close to 90 as you say.

This could incentivize people to search for weapon repair kits in-game."
bufandatl,Then leave this sub. It only exists to complain about the game and troll the complaining posters.
guarlo,Still waiting for RPK or RPK-74 though!
happycoiner2000,A full backpack sounds like a player scav to me
plznorepotr,"Not to burst your bubble, but the kitted RPK might be due to the scav killing/looting a PMC with said gun and then you killed the scav somewhere else."
SolitaryVictor,Because it literally like JUST happened?
djolk,They are potatoes again though.
iAmRadic,"A kitted RPK? That must have been a raider, no?
I doubt scavs spawn with guns like that"
Esatron,"But what about this thing I use to cheese new players that got nerfed/changed?? You're so stupid for not agreeing with me, you're probably paid by Nikita, you might as well be Nikita."
Cattaphract,This was something that was fun in Dark and Darker. Killing mobs aka scavs was exciting for loot. It added another layer of fun instead of just being a head eyes annoyance
Litelinkolas,Because people are stupid and will complain about anything before daring to praise anything
HelloHiHeyAnyway,">the kitted RPK I found was off an AI scav

Sounds like a player scav...

Player scavs are normally juiced. Lighthouse is a great place to hunt player scavs too."
bigred1978,"That's nice, now where do I put that loot?

I only got the base version of the game so my stache is VERY limited in my opinion.  Upgrading the stache is a painful game of rolling the dice and almost never finding the parts necessary."
Turbulent-Wolf8306,"Well. 

Scav guns still have a chance to jam when repaired. And im not risking 20min of loading time and another 40min in game on a gun that can jam"
nsbrough,Gives weapon repair kit a purpose
Noperope42069,People are talking about it wdym.
Orbitazi,"Been noticing that lately, yesterday I killed a scav that had a GPU and a OFZ Shell on his rig... Never seen that happen in 1.000h of playtime... Also, it was a AI Scav, not a player scav"
No_Issue214,i got usb flash+moonshine from the backpack's scav i killed
gkonn,"I found an ai scav with a ak-74u modded with a 60 rounded of bt, then i realised it wasn't found in raid and tracked the player the scav killed a looted it from lmao"
Sergej-Galejev,"And i get LMG gunned by Scavs on Customs while hidding behind sandbags and crying for my life. My friends dead corpse lies across the street.

Supressive fire is yeeting accross the bridge.

Peeked with 4x Scope mosin for one second and was death immediatly...

&#x200B;

Welcome to Tarkov"
PanProjektor,"This sub is for complaining sir,"
InhaledTerror79,About every 5th raid now I get map snipped by a scav with a Saiga9
GeneralGeilheit,This wipe I've already found 2 GZHEL Armors on AI Scavs - simply amazing
96geckos,AI Scavs also pick up loot from dead bodies so they might snag an extra gun off a dead pmc or equip their backpacks.
Underdogger,"I wasn't aware they actually changed something, but it makes sense now that you mention it. I killed an AI scavs in the parking lot of Old Gas and it had a KS23-M with Shrap-10. Thought it was super weird but maybe that it was such a lucrative spawn."
g3org3_all3n,Yeah loving the scav changes
killjoySG,"I found 2 streamer keychains on scavs in a row, life is good."
whomstboi,You sure the scav didn’t pick up the rpk from a pmc?
DabbleDAM,I’ve actually bought a few guns from fence because they were marginally cheaper to buy and repair to 90%+ than to buy brand new from traders.
mattyp2109,"It’s really solid and gives purpose to buying guns on fence now, especially pre-flea. Buying a bunch of AK-74’s at level 11 from fence that aren’t pieces of shit. Saw 2 VSS’s on there the other day too, in fine condition."
Jase_the_Muss,Domed a scav on scav island that had a ledex... That raid went from questing to getting the fuck out.
rangermcclure,I love the new scavs
MTBfox_420,Kudos for the positive post. God bless you man. This reddit needs positivity all around like ASAP
Tlomz27,"Love this change, now cool scav guns aren't worthless."
ClockworkArcBDO,I was wondering what was going on. I just did a shoreline raid and the first scav I killed had a grizzly in his backpack and a half decent AK.
hughie1987,Found 5 100/100 guns last night as a scav in boxes including an rsass so that's being saved for gunsmith when I get to it haha
General-Mils,Our first buff?!?!
rykef,Are you sure you aren't just killing me over and over on my scav?
GoTTi4200,It's because most people only bitch on here but THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME
Nibbaslaya,It’s a great change. Although it used to be fine until they fucked it.
LordSaladz,"It only makes sense for a ""scav""enger to have some loot on them! Honestly they used to seem more like patrollers more than scavengers. They would just stand around looking for someone to shoot. It makes more sense now that they also have been looting around looking for stuff to survive."
Donsen420,Yep you are absolutely right and that was an excellent refreshing change.
murrkpls,I'm 90% sure that BSG didn't even mean to do this at all and some dude there just pressed a wrong button while removing ammo from traders. Watch out for the ''this bug has been fixed post'' coming to Twitter soon kek.
Thepotionguy,Found a KS-23 on a scav in customs by big red. Pretty cool stuff imo
TheQueenOfAntarctica,"tru 
I lovee this change"
Helian7,Hmm I like the change. More combat
Loppicapp,Dude when I do scav runs I spawn with crazy shit.
EpicRaginAsian,"Great change, do scavs have loot in their rig though? I don't bother checking usually since they usually only carry ammo or mags there"
danielguy,"I found a nice TAPCO SKS on a scav yesterday that I was able to repair to 96%, indeed a nice change"
Johnny_B_Naughty,Plus they turned on scav spawns that were previously off. Makes the world feel alive and more dangerous
Sanctif13d,"In two raids back to back my two pals found willerz wallets AND gingy keychains, as a pair on scavs they killed.  1 dead scav = 1 gingy and 1 willerz wallet in the same backpack, two raids in a row.  Wild."
swingingsaw,they are
Btaelman,Can AI scavs loot containers now? I was on customs and there was what looked like an AI scav opening up a weapons box.
Firecracker048,"They did I think because of the weapon repair change, so it actually allows you develop that skill to get special functions on weapons."
TheSmokeJumper_,The scav changes are awesome. Lots of streamer/kappa items on them and the guns are awesome. If you are ever down bad the scavs will give you free gun for the rest of wipe
ToiletGrenade,"I got a super kitted out SKS on my scav yesterday and after ratting and taking the scraps of a super high casualty PMC fight, I got out with some major spoils with no hiccups. Playing as a scav this wipe nets more profit than playing as a PMC from my experience."
KRYPT1X_1963,I always figured if I kill a scav with a bunch of items in their bag that they were a player scav lol. welcome change!
Lego812,Found a scav wielding an m4 today. Pretty fucking cool change honestly.
hellaflush727,i love this change but the sound is broken so...........................
helmer012,"Yes. I killed a scav, went to loot a box then came back to take the scavs gun like 20 seconds later and the gun was gone. Turns out another scav looted it. Thats imo a great and fun change, gave me a little scooby doo type mystery."
UnYeeted4684,Yeah after 4 wipes I am finally making myself loot scavs. I have found most my kappa items that way
KaiDynasty,"Well at this point if scavs are becoming a profit loot source, they can justify their fucking aimbot lol"
Cabo_Green,Shhhh Ive just been looting the dead scavs on interchange and streets to make some solid profit. Don’t tell anyone
Captain_Cheesepuffs,"Credit where credit is due, this is really cool. They should do the same for raiders as a way to get western attachments that aren’t on traders. Stuff like Vudus and Vortex scopes."
JewPhone_WhoDis,Changes?  I still get aimbot one tapped by scavs and players equally.
Susp,Does a damaged weapon affects only jamming chance or accuracy too?
viking1313,"Yes, this is a good change.

I had fun playing tarkov solo last night, I hope they don't reverse it."
Ineludible_Ruin,"I honestly wouldn't care too much if they buffed the scavs back up a bit as long as they're carrying loot like this, minus terminator scavs that dome you from a mile away or can see thru bushes and walls of course."
SexyStyrofoamPuns,"oh man the durability thing makes sense now. I saw a PMC using a like 30/95 durability gun and was like ""brooo how many raids has this gun made it through"" but it was probably just a scav gun lol"
Sestos,"Best loot I have found has been flare chests.. as a scav. No clue why no one has looted them but have got nice body armor and weapons out of cases that everyone else just ran past I guess thinking it was bait. I guess the person who called it in got killed before getting to the crate...

But so far I have just got junk off regular svac's I think the ones on streets had some AKMs and AK74M thru which is the best I have seen drop so far that was not a boss or guards."
Foxfury,"There are some negatives to this change, I’ve noticed guns that you find that used to have 7.62 BP in them now have PS instead. The durability change is great though."
user279156,"Just did a scav raid and spawned with 25ap6.3, a can of peas and not one but TWO SJ6s XD"
iFloody,For me is the custom VPOs-215 that comes with some of them. I love clapping people and scavs (while pmc'ing) with it.
Trick_College2491,"I killed a scav on customs that had a SVD-98 with a thermal scope. I couldn’t believe it, he was definitely AI too. Awesome loot"
SilentReavus,"I'm a fan. Definitely better than them being completely unusable.

I would probably take more malfunctions over the garbage accuracy and not being able to hit anything past 50 feet"
NachoBear9598,Oh yeah the scav changes are amazing. They were too deadly in the beginning of the wipe but I feel now they're in the perfect spot. That plus the scav guns being viable plus improved AI... very nice.
24Scoops,Ok I just noticed this last night. Scav I killed had a kitted AK. If they move the good ammo to later trader levels but make it much easier to find on scavs in raid. I fully support that decision and think it's a great way to balance the change they made to ammo.
Nukacola_Premium,Almost every scav I kill on streets has a rare stim. It's kinda bonkers.
roflwafflelawl,"I thought it was kinda like this since Scavs could start looting too. Forgot when exactly that patch was. 

I don't believe they looted loose items but I believe they would pick up and often use the weapon that was on a body for example."
Penis_Bees,"I think scavs loot dead ai/players backpacks now. I killed an AI scav, then a minute later another AI in the same spot that had clearly looted the gun off the first. The first one had missing slots at the top of it's backpack and the seconds backpack had 6 items in it, the bottom few would have fit in the in the missing spaces on the first scavs backpack."
Critical_Employee330,I’ve had so much dope shit on scav raids but the amount of times other player scavs have killed me is really starting to piss me off there needs to be a better punishment for scav on scav crime
Necessary_Fig_2265,"Once again surprised by positivity in this sub, good post"
Gr8er_than_u_m8,"Would be kinda cool if scavs start with dogshit inventories, but actually go loot the items on the map just like PMCs do."
DafaqYuDoin,"Yes!!! In previous wipes it was common knowledge not to search a scav vest because you already know there’s two mags associated with the gun they’re holding and nothing else. I killed a scav that had: 2 CMS kit, 1 morphine, 1 Chalok B, 1 IFAK, and an MRE. Like what"
WashingtonPunk,"Can confirm, I picked a Gingy, flash drive and moderately modded ADAR off an AI scav on reserve 2 days ago. Took the ADAR back in and got another scav with another Gingy and an SMT on them, and a fully built toz with utg optic."
Sway40,I got killed by an AI scav running level 5 armor and helmet. took a couple shots with shit ammo early wipe and he 180 headshot me. Wouldve been cool loot though
geno604,"Also scavs have suppressors now, thats a huge meta change for me.  Traditionally if i heard a suppressed shot i knew immediately, pmc."
FAfoxtrot115,Ran into a scav that had a bunch of pistols in his bookbag it was weird
buckets-_-,"no more BT/SNB on the single-shot rifle scavs anymore :(

used to get like 2+ stacks of it, but now all I'm seeing is LPS/tracers

which is prob a good change, but I miss my free ammo :(

edit: got some BS ammo on a mosin scav so evidently they can still spawn w/ goated bullets"
Sp3ctre777,Found a willerz wallet on a scav yesterday lol
TimmeTehWise,"I didn't know they did this, I had killed a scab and gotten an am with 50/98 durability and thought that it was odd that I could repair it to an actually good durability, but This wipe I can't really play any of the larger maps, because my game starts stuttering horrendously whenever I get into combat with a pmc, this lag is however greatly reduced on factory, so I've mainly been playing factory."
rxece,"Ye it's a good change, scav guns no longer feel worthless. I've been collecting AKs from them"
aoiao,You jynxed it now it is getting a nerf you fool.
Gr0gus,"Just got an Mk17 with 89 condition after repair out of a dead scav during a scav raid.

Nit only this justify the weapon repair kit and skill much more, but I’d spread some luck RNG over all players … very welcome change."
throwaway062006,My friend's scav had a KS-23 with shrap-10
ProfessionalThat1289,"Yeah rogues as well, found a rogue with an aesa and an electric motor in his back pack last night."
nachocheeze246,"My favorite AI scav I have seen so far is the one with the Toz that has a scope on it, hilarious!"
ThisIsReflex,we must be killing different scavs then
MengskDidNothinWrong,When did this happen?
Travilcopter,As amazing as this is my biggest frustration with SCAVING i being placed SMACK dab in the middle of PMC's who are fully geared only to be instantly robbed. You get spawned in with PMCS at the same time and youre not catching the back end anymore.
Glad_Fig1874,Because people on this subreddit ONLY focus on the negative and any time something fun is added they ignore it.
KillaOwnsMe,Dude found a willerz wallet and hungry chain on one 😂
crpiecho,weapon ammo found in weapons got hit hard. . Weapons found in crates will have bottom level ammo now
MySaltSucks,Found a pkpm key in a regular scavs pilgrim
Mr_Metalslug,Low key the best thing about this wipe besides the new content. I pray they keep this.
Freejack02,Because it's not an enormous change. You can pay to fix scav guns now and they'll jam a little less often? Hooray.
Faesarn,And now some of the daily quests are actually doable ! I got a quest to bring 2 FiR toe with 80+ durability.. which was impossible before because all toz found on scavd had like 65 max dura.
fluffhead42O,"I've looted so many lab keywords of scams, great other keys, got a tetris on a scav earlier today. Great guns, sights. Scav runs starting off with great gear/loot. I love it"
Punchy_Karma,"Yea I’ve been finding pretty cracked loot. So far I’ve found 2 GP coins, Merin key, labs card, and an sj6. Like they are actually worth checking now"
ThrottleFox1,"being a super new player, these scav guns are decent throw aways for me when i go into raids, no real need to buy a new kit"
Ripper7M,"My scav last night had a .366 AK with I think the Zhukov stock, a suppressor, and one of the red dot scopes. Of course I took it to Lighthouse to put it to good use to try for some pmcs or rogues. And I died doing exactly that with it lol but it was great to start with a decent/good gun."
DtForrest,"I first thought those are some players scavs that areto be ai, especially some their aim sucked, but that’s just the new scav for ya."
ZealousidealStage723,"I swear they only thorax or head, eyes you this wipe"
Thejunky1,"I've had 3 scav spawns in a row with flares. I've pulled 2svds and almost full kit of mods for both, an m4, the holy sausage, 4 grizzly, 3 moon shine and allllllll the craftables short the 1 friggin bloodset I've been looking for for the last week."
chrisashley91,I’ve found so many gingy chains and willer wallets it’s been insane. Along with twitch rivals stuff.
BernieSandals_m,In my last raid I on shoreline the scav that spawns on the extract Road to Customs had a Led-X.  Wtf.
LocksmithCharming790,Every third scav got a labs card.
proscreations1993,"Ya I was running garage on interchange with a pistol for quests and scav kills and a bunch of the scavs had almost full backpacks full of loot.  Good stuff too! I made 900k that raid and I didn’t loot anything but the scavs I killed lol 

They also had an akm with a nice hand guard  foregrip stock and bastion with the weird yellow holo sun red dot that’s on the s&b scope on the kitted g28 
And then An ak74 with some decent parts.  Nothing I’d actually run but actually worth some money

The biggest thing is the durability to
I farm raiders all the time. How I stockpile my 995, m63, bp etc and get free helmets and tier5 armors and meds and nades.  Before their guns were worthless to run. You stripped the good parts and sold the rest.  My last raiders I saw the red bar in my stash super low and checked and the mdr was 42 dura and I was like wow garbage yay.  But then realized it was out of 100 instead of 42/54 etc.  it repaired to 97.5 or something.  So raider and boss guns are actually useable now.   Fuck yeah. Or even scav guns like akms or vss can be brought out. Repaired and then kitted out and used.  About time"
AdministrativeNet126,I found a Gingy Keychain in a dead Scav on Woods yesterday.
bwheatley,"The better your scav rep the better the gear they have. :) Glad to see you finally got your karma up, they have had good loot, and been looting the battlefield for a few years now.

&#x200B;

edit: typo"
constantdegeneracy,Because they made the change 2 weeks into the wipe when a large amount of players are level 15+ and no longer need scav guns?
der_m4ddin,"Wowowowowowow 
I just needed 24 Bullets to Drop the scav with my shot Ammo :D"
Masteroxid,"Because all of these changes are shadowed by the bullshit AI and the fact that they increased the number of spawns as well.

What else do you want people do? We already had a thread about it. Do you want them to suck off BSG daily for it or something?"
No-Permit-1187,Loot on Scavs changed like a year ago.
Secret-Aerie7275,It’s for the noobs out there that’s about it
Wormholer_No9416,But muh Gzhel n muh Raptor reeeeeeeee
flaschemate,"Also they whole AI (not just aim) got so much better. 
Pathfinding is insane. And they also react to voicelines from PMCs. 
Yesterday a scav just ran around the spine on shoreline and suddenly stood on top of it."
Insanity8016,"I think that it’s a nice change to have max durability at around 90% but I think the max durability range should be larger. For example, have it from like 50%-90% not just always be around 90% or always be around 50%. Gives more variety."
raztjah,Nice try Nikita...
Sauceror,"This is probably a blessing and a curse as it might slowly increase scav on scav violence. If you scav in on a map you might find everything already picked clean and then I bet people will just take try luck to get away with killing a few scavs to get loot. 

I was enjoying my chill scav runs running into other (mostly) friendly scavs. Will be sad if those days are over."
keithstonee,Hopefully this means a PvE game mode is coming.
threwasausernamehere,I mean last while Flechette and 55a1 I all got from scavs. And NPC scavs will pretty regularly have labs Access cards on em if luck is on your side. Also people said they seem harder this whipe but they feel the exact same to me.
BukLauFinancial,"lol, this change got implemented over a year ago"
