seratoninsgone,Is he reading the wrong script
Remonamty,"You mean that his guy

his actual guy

the guy who wanted US to pull out of NATO

the guy who actually blackmailed Zelensky

might not have the best interests of US allies like Poland and their closest neighbor Ukraine at heart?"
FortySixAndYou,"Well, Senator Graham, you had two chances to try to get the country out of this shit show, and you failed."
cbcking,Would he be saying this if Trump was the president?
feastoffun,"Isn’t this the same guy who surrounds himself with “I’d rather be a Russian then a Democrat?” idiots?

A big reason why Russia invaded Ukraine is because Republicans like him gave the go ahead to Putin."
Frankie6Strings,Shit Show Veteran Decries Shit Show
Beermedear,"Vladdy’s checks aren’t clearing the bank, it would seem."
Vegan_Harvest,Somebody stopped paying him I guess.
ooouroboros,"So Lindsey is turning on Trump now, is he?"
darwinwoodka,Well he helped create the shit show
DeadBloatedGoat,"He basically said the same about Trump after the attack on the Capitol, then reversed course soon after - not because he was presented with compelling evidence justifying the attack or confirming election fraud, but rather the realisation he would lose his Senate seat if he continued down that anti-Trump path. So why does anything this person says make news. He stands for nothing except himself."
NowIAmThatGuy,He probably has investments in the military industrial complex so he’s just looking to profit off the suffering of others. Nothing to see here.
hskfmn,Graham's never met a war he didn't like...
OtakuOran,"I'm going to say something I've never said before...

I agree with Lindsey Graham.

Brb, gonna go wash my mouth out with soap."
picado,When the guy you hate makes a good point.
FortCharles,"So he's finally not Putin's friend anymore?

What took so long, Linds?"
jackiea40,"I mean, can we just send him??"
Quiet_War3842,The check must have bounced.
Bridgestone14,"Ah man, I hate it when I agree with Lindsey.  Graham or Lohan."
Unhappy-Grapefruit88,Someone should let the Russians know their last check to Lindsey bounced.
MethBearBestBear,"This is Graham, i post count how many times he was ""tired of the shit show"" trump way making only to curl up in trumps lap like 2 days later

Man flips and flops more than an energetic fish just reeled into the boat"
anythingMuchShorter,"Huh, I guess even a clock full of shit is right twice a day."
OpticalReality,"I don’t think people have woken up to the fact that we are fighting a (proxy) war with Russia right now. 

I am not a fan of Graham and many of his colleagues, but there has never been a better opportunity to marginalize Russia’s position on the global stage. They literally handed it to us on a silver platter. 

It amazes me that the same people who condemn Russia for its belligerence and express support for the people of Ukraine will also slam the US for providing military aid. It’s the ultimate hypocrisy. If you support Ukraine then wouldn’t you want to do everything possible to prevent them from being crushed by Putin? If you don’t agree with the US supplying aid to Ukraine then you are essentially supporting the invasion of one of our allies by a corrupt, unpredictable, nuclear-equipped oligarchy."
Cdub7791,"We probably will at some point, but the whole ""just send tanks"" thing misses a few points. First, logistics aren't easy for modern tanks. Sending a bunch of different tanks from different countries means different supply chains, different munitions, different maintenance, different training, and a whole bunch of headaches for the Ukrainians that may or may not be offset by the tank capabilities. Second, speaking of capabilities, tanks (and most modern weapons actually) are best thought of as part of a system of systems rather than individual weapons. Unless we are going to provide most of the ""bells and whistles"" that make up that system, and the training to go along with it, even the best tank in the world will be of marginal utility."
exspasticcomics,"That's what he said today. Tomorrow, More money will arrive and he will say something else."
Meritedes,"Ofc he would say this, how could he repay the weapons companies that donated to him?"
GRANITO,War is bipartisan. Watch Kevin McCarthy keep passing bills to sell weapons to Ukraine. There's a reason weapons contractors have plants in every state (think of the jobs lost if we didn't sell these weapons!)
_DontBeAScaredyCunt,I’m tired of the shit show that is Lindsay graham
Jefe710,"What's the matter, did Putins check bounce?"
zzxxccbbvn,"You heard it here first folks. Lindsey Graham said send tanks to Ukraine for the sake of ""World Order"""
Malthusian1,"Oh interesting, I guess he’s found a way to profit off of sending tanks to Ukraine."
Freezepeachauditor,Broken clock
1984ToyotaCamry,"Dammit now I’m agreeing with Lindsey Graham, what kind of bizarro world did I just wake up in"
Im_scared_of_my_wife,The Russian checks are starting to not clear
I-melted,"The great thing about having a liberal mindset, is that I can agree with good ideas no matter where the idea came from. But I have to admit feeling strange agreeing with that nasty prick."
Kai_Times,"He hasn't been this correct since he pointed out what a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot Trump is...

Of course, he immediately flip-flopped on that, so should we trust what he says?"
Prometheus720,"Lindsay Graham is exactly who I think of every time someone says, ""Even a broken clock is right twice a day.""

He is a terrible person almost all the time and once in a while he very publicly goes against the GOP grain."
FatManInALittleSuite,"As a native South Carolinian, I really hate this man.  However, he ain’t wrong on this one."
lainwla16,I agree with Lindsey Graham and I feel super fucking weird about it
PUfelix85,Why do I feel weird agreeing with this man.
canadianleroy,"1:04am Sunday Jan 22, 2023.

I just agreed with Lindsay Fucking Graham."
zaydore,Here we go little lindy trying to be revalent ! Too late !¡!!
machuitzil,"Am I wrong or is it kind of hard to give a shit what this traitor has to say. Broken clock and all that, go fuck yourself, Lindsey. 

Obviously we support Ukraine, your support has been expected. The shit show is due to your colleagues. So go fuck yourself, Lindsey."
Draxus335,Weird times when this guy has a take I strongly agree with.
GiftedOaks,This is how insane the right has gotten. They've made me agree with Lindsey Fucking Graham
just4kicksxxx,"Hate to be that guy, but does anyone else think it's kind of rich now that it involves predominantly white countries it's super important even though this shit has been happening all over the world for a while?"
hi_im_haley,Said the shit show.
ferrets4ever,Now watch all the GQP Putin shills crawl out from under their rocks and whine.
thatonefortune,Lindsey Graham being a hawk is nothing new. It's the single consistent thing about the guy
2Mains,"Also Lindsey Graham: *Otherwise, I have a pretty high tolerance for shit-shows. You must have seen a few of mine.*"
skankunt,"My meemaw tells me that nothing is sacred, and that I should never trust a man named Lindsey."
,[removed]
PutinsAwussyboy,I’m agreeing with this invertebrate?
Ha_CharadeUAre,Here I am minding my own business and all of the sudden find myself agreeing with Lindsey Graham……gonna be a weird day
Oceans_Apart_,"Once in a while, Lindsey Graham inadvertently reminds everyone that he knows better and then quickly reinserts his head up his own ass before anyone figures out he's culpable of Congress being a shit show in the first place."
someoneexplainit01,"The US has only given Ukraine leftover shit that was mothballed and is 30+ years old and ammunition that would have cost millions to decommission.  America is literally saving money by giving the old useless shit to Ukraine.

We don't need or use HIMARS because we have the F117.  Yeah, that's some old shit too, it went into service in the late 70s and we didn't even find out about it till 1992.  We have so much leftover shit we don't need.  Lets send them all those littoral combat ships we built and we decided were too expensive to use so we already decommissioned them.  Lets send them every freaking leftover we got.

**This isn't about Ukraine.**  *The mass graves, the torture, the blatant war crimes, or the heroism of the Ukrainian people in the face of pure evil.*

This is about nuclear war and nothing else.

1936: Hitler invaded the demilitarized Rhineland.  The allies did nothing.

1938: Hitler invaded and annexed Austria.  The allies did nothing.

1939: Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia.  The allies did nothing.

1939: Hitler invades Poland.

1940: Hitler conquers Denmark, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, and France.

&#x200B;

1999: Putin invades Chechnya.  50,000+ civilians dead.

2008: Putin invades Georgia.  The West ignores it.

2014: Putin invades Ukraine, seizes Luhansk, Donetsk, and Crimea.  14,000+ civilians dead.  The west does nothing but tries to appease Putin.

2015: Putin invades Syria.  Mass murder, chemical weapons, and generous war crimes.

2019: Putin invades Kazakhstan.

2021: Putin invades Ukraine, this time to annex the entire country.

&#x200B;

**Hitler didn't stop, appeasement did nothing but embolden him.  What makes anyone believe that Putin will stop if we don't stop him?**

&#x200B;

If Putin prevails in Ukraine, then we have at most a couple years before he invades Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, or Poland.  Russia's conventional military will fall to NATO in 48 hours or less.  Then we are at inevitable Nuclear war.

The only way to prevent inevitable nuclear holocaust is to destroy Russia inside of Ukraine.  We have sent no American troops.  We just sent them some leftovers that we would literally have to pay billions of dollars to decommission safely.  Maybe send them some 20+ year old shit now, its not like they are asking for F35s and tomahawks.

Giving Ukraine more so we don't all die in a Nuclear holocaust is a very small price to pay."
MylastAccountBroke,Your party is the issue here Lindsey.
BrooklynBarcelona,You lost me at “Lindsey Graham said...”
intellifone,Lindsey is responsible for the shit show. Fuck him
Healthy_Jackfruit_88,"Ladies and gentlemen, the “War for profit” politician."
throw123454321purple,"Oh, Lindsay, now I see you back in the news I can confidently say that it has been not at all long enough."
apprehensivelights,which side are we on?
Icy-Morning-4896,Isn’t this the same seditious little rat that tried to keep Trump in the white house? Fuck all these traitors.
Asphodelmercenary,I hate agreeing with this guy. I hate it. But he’s right. Once. Ugh.
whereismysounder,Hate it when Linsey says something I agree with.  Dude has moments of clarity and then goes batshit crazy the rest of the time.
SaltyLittleLich,"Excuse me, what's he tired of?

His party is the one that said Putin is the victim in all this from day 1.

God, he's such a withered testicle."
knowssomestuff47,On the surface this seems like a good idea. But it must be a horrible idea for world order based on the person saying it.
_awacz_,Thing with large shaft. Lindsay like.
redvillafranco,"If Lindsey Graham is making sense, then I’m on the wrong side of this. No tanks!"
Ishidan01,"a Republican has said something.

ITT:  all the many, many ways he is completely wrong."
sombertimber,Ask him tomorrow…
errdayimshuffln,Did Russia's card decline or what?
Chaserivx,Lindsey graham doesn't care about anything but himself and idc wtf he has to say
OutlyingPlasma,"Ok, Lindsey Graham, you lead the charge."
1Ianjojo,Yes….we wouldn’t want a shit show.
,Lindsey has a lot of rubles riding on the outcome of this war.
greeneyedguru,He's one of the stars of the shit show
NorwayRat,Rare Lindsay Graham W
Coffee_green,I guess the Russian sanctions must be working
tiny_pickle9001,"Don't worry everyone, Miss Lindsey will suddenly change her mind again next week saying the demon Biden is defending the N azi Ukraine /s"
Wolfman01a,"Nuclear war is at stake.

If Russia wins against the Ukraine, they plan to roll into Poland.

NATO would then attack and the Russians would lose 1000 to 1 casualty wise.   Russia will launch nukes before Putin is done."
Auto18732,Looks like Putin was late on this guys bribe payments.
syadastfu,This is just Lindsay letting his handlers know that this months payment is late and its time for a raise.
ThoughtfulLlama,Someone outbid Moscow?
United-Cockroach-980,Maybe don’t be in a party of Russian financed grifters?
YuronimusPraetorius,"Today Ukraine, tomorrow the world"
Appropriate_Mess_350,"Every time a Republican says something rational and responsible my first thought is, “what are they up to?”."
boycowman,"Don't usually agree with Lindsey, but yeah."
Reiquaz,Watch Graham reverse these words in a day. Don't put it past em. Hypocrisy is the republican mantra
funinthecaprisun,"Even a broken clock is right, ect., ect.."
jish5,"You know shit's bad when even Republicans are finally saying the right thing. Like they're finally starting to get just how dire the Ukraine/Russia war is and how if it's not dealt with soon, we're gonna have a far worse situation beyond just that war. Republicans seemed to have forgotten that Putin is not a stable person and that, until Trump, he was considered a threat to all, to where until Trump, it would have been considered horrible for ANY politician to be buddies with a tyrant like him."
EpictetanusThrow,He knows what side his muffin is buttered.
prezidente_me,"Interesting but when global population shrinks and the average education level will be higher, such politicians will simply extinct"
stillestwaters,Lindsey Graham is so annoying because he just repeats one specific criticism with a curse word thrown in and is made to be this outlandish individualist because he dared to throw a fit. It’s been his gimmick for a while now. So lame.
foggy-sunrise,His Russia money must be drying up.
mk2vr6t,Why should anyone give a fuck about what comes out of his dick lips?
TheEightSea,The same Senator that voted to acquit the President that threatened the Ukrainian president because of internal US politics?
NonsenseKing,"Did I wake up in Bizarro World? I agree with something Lindsey Graham said. 
I kind of feel dirty..."
nycdiveshack,What would happen if this were posted to r/conservative
,Did he buy stock in whatever companies build tanks?
MaASInsomnia,Did his Russian checks start bouncing  or something?
hyperiongate, Put Lindsey in the lead tank.  Let's see how he feels about that.
iKangaeru,"Has he walked that statement back yet? By mid-week, he'll be saying we should get out of Ukraine and lift the sanctions on Russia."
insanityCzech,Lindsey Graham has made an entire career of saying dumb shit.
Snoo-72438,"You can always gauge how solid the GOPs footing is on an issue by observing whose dick Lindsey is sucking. If he sounds reasonable, the GOP is losing on an issue"
ranrunone,This guy has the credibility of a broken box of rocks.
PB_JNoCrust,"The Strykers and Bradleys that we are sending are both very capable pieces of equipment and will be a huge boost. The leopard tanks from Germany will be easier to maintain and should get there first. Abrams are a whole different beast and will need time for the Ukrainians to figure out and learn. However, I’m sure they will come later."
sad-dave,"Cool, Senator. You can go first."
mia_elora,"I have this urge to check my timeline.  This just honestly surprised me, for some reason."
Quinquilharia,"&#x200B;

I’ve heard it said that Lindsey Graham is like one of those pilot fish that swims behind sharks to feed on scrap."
Humbleronaldo,Worst person you know makes a sensible take 😳😳
throwawaypackers,I didn’t have agreeing with Lindsey Graham today on my bingo card.
lifeofideas,"The worst thing is when Ted Cruz says something I agree with. I have to re-examine everything. This is almost as bad. Why, Lindsey Graham, must you do something normal now and then?"
Icy-Morning-4896,"He'll be praising Putin if DeSantis wins in 2024. Graham is a reprehensible, spineless GOP shitbag."
Juxtacation,It would be great if he could just make up his mind… Q or not Q?
Seamus35,War brings out the real white supremacists
ApeOver,We have literally thousands of tanks collecting dust Goddang it
weelluuuu,He had me at shit show. I thought he would be announcing his retirement. Then he said send in tanks and I thought he was talking about Florida.
AgitatedBackground96,"Oh shit, did we finally use one of the lizard doubles that the MAGA crowd thinks we have to replace him?"
Voodoo_Masta,"“I’m tired of this shit show, so let’s just start WWIII and get it over with”

- Lindsey Hillbilly Hypocrite Graham"
rrrdesign,And maybe if he acts tough people will forgive/forget what a toadie he was with Trump and how he tried to steal an election
ilolz2,5 minutes later…. “I’m tired of this s*** show’ Ukraine needs to give us our aide back”
DemiMini,clearly he got a new batch of polls and decided to message the results.
SwayzeOfArabia,Lol massive asshole tires of shit show. The levels of irony are approaching Morissette-ian levels.
Charming-Chard7558,Someone just wants out from under all the Kompromat
Even_Author_3046,"Flip flop flip flop... all day long, flip flop"
kokes88,Breaking news a warmonger wants the US to get involved in another war
cranialduggery,Is he about to make money somehow from this?
Raptorex27,"I’m sorry, but when we see a post/article that begins with “Lindsey Graham said,” we should promptly and collectively ignore it."
quest-to-know,This might be the first and only good suggestion that Lindsey Graham has ever made.
top_value7293,Hmmm. Wtf. He’s actually right this time😳
SalsaBueno,*Now* he’s on board.
Machette_Machette,You know it is fucked up when a fucked up GOP member is rational.
davpad12,"I can't stand Lindsey Graham but I agree with him on this one, If we're going to help LET'S HELP, let's end this thing, pussy footing around with Russia can go on forever."
MegamemeSenpai,Rare Lindsey Graham W
aquafina6969,for once I agree with him
silliestboots,It's so confusing when Lindsey Graham says something I agree with but for completely different reasons than I agree with. O_o
Sorry-Business-1152,First time I’ve acually Agreed with this weasel
rmscomm,Hey Lindsey you are 4 years too late and you got the wrong country. You should have stood up and stopped our own internal strife before suggesting we look at others.
Hambone919,"Wow, something we can agree with!!"
Moleday1023,"Not often do I agree with Lindsey, but today, I do.  Must be snowing in hell, right now."
cashrchek,I'm sure he'll step back in line when the bourbon wears off.
speedneeds84,"Well, Lindsey Graham would be the one to know about shitshows, but that’s a different matter.

Exactly what tanks does he think the US should be sending to Ukraine? The Abrams is a turbine engine tank, and if we’d started training crews on operations, maintenance, and logistics as soon as the war started they’d MAYBE be ready to take delivery by now. The German Leopard is a turbo diesel, and while still a sophisticated tank, any shade tree mechanic would be able to keep it up and running with minimal training."
lostinspace801,First right thing he has ever said
KonaKathie,"Is the apocalypse upon us? It must be, as I am agreeing with Lindsay Graham"
CornmealGravy,"It’s crazy, but I actually agree with this"
FlyingSolo57,For a moment there I thought Lindsey was talking about the GOP. He's such an arse.
onepiecevincent,Not the heel turn I expected on the Lords day
MynameisJunie,"For once, he's said something right! Maybe he can be the GOP whisperer.....shouter, tamer?"
browndogmn,Send the fucking tanks already
thomaja1,OMG!  IS HE BROKEN?  I agree with this slight ass fucker for a change.
tunamelts2,I don’t believe he could possibly be *so right* on any issue. Has a body snatcher a hold of him?
Efficient_Light350,"For once I agree with Graham. If Ukraine fails in its attempt at winning the war against Russia, Russia itself admits that its imperial desires will not stop at Ukraine. Poland and the Baltics will be next and Russia still will not stop. Russia will continue to try to conquer as much as it can. It would be fine if these countries desired Russian rule but in the case of Ukraine 97% of its people do not. This is a war where the population of Ukraine is fighting using their own people and those who stand with them."
Tirianspark,"If the Abrams are not suitable, F-16s and Leopards then"
JasonJasonBoBason,I’m just glad to see a contingent of the GOP is pro-Ukraine because I have concerns how much we fund them once Republicans take control of things.
houstonyoureaproblem,"It’s not really a shit show.

It’s a proxy war, and our side is winning.

Acting tough doesn’t make you tough, Lindsey. We’re all very familiar with who you really are. You’re not fooling anyone."
cindylooboo,I feel kinda weird that I'm in agreement with Lindsay Graham. I need to go shower or something.
RedRyder760,Even a broken clock is right sometimes.
Temporary-Survey-273,For once I find myself in complete agreement with Lindsay Graham. I wouldn’t have thought that possible!
Ryan_in_the_hall,Never thought I’d agree so much with this guy
AFQpro,"The problem is Senator, you Yahoos in DC are too busy with both time and money either defending those from your political party or going after the other side to actually doing the job you were elected for. My comment goes for the Democrats too."
CombatConrad,I feel weird for agreeing with him.  Rare W.
ProgrammingAccount90,A lot of Russian shills in the comments
Awesomeo-5000,Never thought I’d agree with this loser but here we are
Illustrious-Night-99,"Well if anyone knows a shit show, he would. He's created enough of them."
MaxPaul1969,“Germany please send your tanks to get rekt by cheap drones so that our Abrams don’t get embarrassed”
Number-Thirteen,Did the Russian paycheques stop coming in Lindsey?
7HMOP,So weird to agree with Graham on anything
rockstar_not,Graham is the brown of the show for sticking up for Trump; that Putin loving sack of the show’s content.
Professional-Spot805,Is today Opposite Day? Never thought I’d be agreeing with this clown.
eveninglily33,"Wow, I can't believe I agree with L. Graham. I'm glad he's saying this."
TechSalesSoCal,Lindsey is the real shit show.
dhunter66,So Lindsey once again stuck his finger to the wind and assessed which way the winds were blowing.
Practical_Shine9583,I wholeheartedly agree. We need to help Ukraine as much as we can defeat the Russians and take back their territory.
mocats1985,"Can believe I’m saying this, but I agree with him 😗."
gamerdudeNYC,He didn’t mind the Trump Shit Show
alvarezg,"For once, Graham is saying the right thing. Let's have more enlightened statements."
urbanlife78,Guess someone's checks from Russia bounced.
stclvr53,Best thing he has said in a long time.
devries,"Two things can be true at the same time:

(1) Lindsey Graham is a dog shit piece of fucking human trash.

(2) On this matter, Lindsey Graham is right."
Terrible_Horror,Can we please put him on the first tank over.
SnooBooks1701,"Wait, I'm agreeing with Lindsey Graham, I don't like this feeling"
Mikesaidit36,"This is the first thing Lindsey Graham has ever said that I agree with, but it’s a good one. He might be human after all"
mottledshmeckle,Whatever allows the escalation so the war pigs can make more money. In the 240 years America has been a country we have be at war somewhere for 220 years. So using the poor as cannon fodder has proved to be lucrative.
yeahyeahyeah711481,"Sure, if he's the first one to get in the tank to go"
pru51,Aka the military complex needs a new war.
face_eater_5000,"I won't say a broken clock is right twice a day, because he's not right that much, but on this issue, he is right. The Abrams tanks were specifically designed to fight in the European theater against Russian forces. We have like 3,000 of these sitting in storage. We can train the Ukrainians and help them end this war, then fast track a new Marshall Plan and get them into NATO and the EU."
VolumeLopsided4157,So how much is he getting from the tank guys?
SubKreature,"It's Lindsey Graham, so I'm sure he'll walk this back shamelessly in a few months."
juana-golf, Russia’s checks bouncing?!?
ElonHuskOfAMan,Putin bounced a check
Perfect-Editor-5008,Looks like someone woke up from his nap cranky. It might be time for his baba. Whiney little snotty brat
treeloverbutenough,He's right. Credit when credit is due
thebochman,How long til he gets censured by his own party for this?
Riversmooth,But he was 100% behind four years of Trump’s SS
Samuraistronaut,"I'll be dead honest, just reading the headline, seeing that he's a Republican and how in bed with Trump he is, I had to pause and wonder if he meant sent tanks INTO (against) Ukraine.

Because there are for sure plenty of Republicans who would do that."
Crime_Buff,Did I just agree with something Graham said? It must be snowing in hell.
alroprezzy,"Wow, I agree with Lindsey Graham on something."
LovinLifeForever,Ladybug Graham gets more and more unhinged in his demeanor and stature.
