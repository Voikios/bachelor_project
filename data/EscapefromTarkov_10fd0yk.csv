pewwww_pewwww,Hollowpoint moment
doublewidesurprise7,"Straight mag dumped lmao that's awesome, I wonder what their PoV looked/sounded like"
Tom_Foolery2,Does that guy know what LMB is?
boofmydick,"Just an hour ago a traitor scav shot me in the head with 7.62x51 from a vepr-hunter. My Kolpak saved my life. Turned around and sprayed him with half a magazine from my klin. I was laughing a lot, couldn't believe it. Wife was pissed because I was playing without my headphones and the ringing effect bothered her."
powahauz,I am just the worst scav. I always die trying to figure out if that person is a scav or a pmc …
Revvay,HP be like
smegmathor,If this were me I'd be dead on the first shot from that sks.
Letpigeonsfly,"I just scaved on streets and killed a pmc that I’m almost positive didn’t register my player on his screen. He ran out right in front of me and started healing whilst I was shooting him still. He didn’t react at all, just healed and ate bullets. The desync has been insane lately."
Sinikal_,But.....did he stop rolling so you could loot?
KRYPT1X_1963,"for anyone curious, 7.62 HP vs the penis helmet had a 50% chance to pen at 6 durability. 0% at 30 durability so it makes sense, you really need to aim for limbs with HP rounds.

*source* Battle Buddy"
MadDog_8762,"This is one of my biggest issues with EFT, just how absolutely tanky players can be"
No-Phase2131,Looks bad. Like cod
shoxpox,Now that’s a bullet sponge
MOR187,u can left click really fast
fapmaster1901,Tarkov is so realistic /s
udum420,I promise nobody wants this kind of game play lol
Popstrekq,Bro literally gave that poor pmc a lobotomy in top class
ts_actual,Does OP know what oversaturation is? Some acid colors screaming going on.
ThexanR,"Casually taking forceful impacts where regardless if the bullet went through or not, their brain is now just mush and melt. Tarkov realism"
zino24k,such a realistic game
Blackfire12498,"Shit looks arcadey and stupid. No blame to you, tho of course."
Cardinal338,That guy's got some good armor....or this dude has some shitty ammo.
aborgcube,Aim punch I love it
Repulsive_Voice823,"I was like ""wtf is this"" but then I realised hp ammo exists"
Zer0Cyber_YT,HP ammo is shit
bringerofthelaw420,What are your settings if you don’t mind me asking
PanProjektor,Die die die die die
CocoMendes,"""dude.. please... dude, hey,... fuck... don't you see I'm in the middle... hey... stop"""
Juckeii,Dont worry he isnt rengawr... he wont hurt you...
Kaneypoo69,"This is why I've unistalled this wipe, what a broken horrible game"
Iteroparous,Pretty clear skill issue imo
CrazyStuntsMan,Did you use HP ammo? No wonder it took so many shots. Chance are the last bullet hit the head
HOU52k,Something about SKS hip fire kills are so satisfying to me
Emperor_Veniano,HP ammo
wantonbobo,"""You guys see me one tap that guy?"""
donthelpoldpeople,This video sums up tarkov ballistics pretty well
Duhmoan,"Lol I’m like 70% sure I’m the dead PMC to the left.

He didn’t “kill me” he shot me in the legs. Then I managed to yeet myself off the top ropes of spine rock and the fall killed me.

If the tag said Gl0ckComa yeah I’m the already dead guy lmao."
JiffTheJester,"Lol holy panic firing, did you catch the body or it rolled in the water?"
ManagerCritical,Ratatata Mo fu 😂😂
Dminz64,I respect that Willy helmet even more now after that video
Adaptr_guy,I thought this was RS2 for a sec. You know that map😌
HaidenFR,"SHOT MORE MORE MORE MORE .... And YOU're dead  


Escape from Tarkov..."
ForsakenTraveler,Wait. Was the PMC on the ground named xRaick by any chance? I remember dying there after dumping a full mag of BP into the guy and he survived
JollyReading8565,I had a naked run with pp (no pun intended) and mag dumped some dude with a sniper and we both ran out of ammo inside gas station. He went for the melee kill and I went for the reload >:)
Intelligent-Trash151,This dude taking 10 rounds to the head but I get one tapped with ulach from someone I never see or hear. Man fuck this game I’m done
Leytarkhan,"I had a similar expierience but with magnum bukshot the only sad part the guy didnt die and he killed me...

Straight magdumped everything into his pp helmet and he lived to see another day."
Bqxz,I think this was me! Can you dm me the in game name or something similar to confirm? I remember taking a scav bp and that helmet the other day and basically having that exact situation happen lmao
Nohoth,"Post raid screen be like  ""20 rounds fired , 1 hit."""
Kaneypoo69,"This is why I've unistalled this wipe, what a broken horrible game"
