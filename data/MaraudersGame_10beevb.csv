RowanKline,"I'm still a fan of the idea of being able to hire NPC security/crew who can man additional guns or hardpoints on your ship. Reckon it's a good money sink and encourages using the larger ships so you can fit additional crew. Could even have different value tiers for them and hiring a more expensive crew member would result in a better armed/more effective deterrent. And same way with ships, you keep them until they die, or maybe until their contract runs out (maybe like 10 raids or something).

I like the bulkhead/locked door idea as well though, maybe some combination would be worthwhile?"
iSellPopcorn,"Loving the ideas the community are suggesting such as these and the ship security, really eager to see what the future holds for this game"
himbobflash,"I actually really like the sound of this. Adding locked doors in general would be really cool, via captain card, lockpick, blowtorch, etc."
OverlordZombwich,"This doesn't really work because the vast majority of players use the Rustbucket. 

The idea is good, but it would need to apply to all ships. The biggest issue is poor new player experience and player retention. The issues causing this are tied to breaching and lack of balance along various aspects of the game. This is including but not limited to shotguns, pod usage, ship disabling and Headshot multiplier.

The easiest and safest fix would be ships within proximity to disabled ships can use pods. If this is implemented using locks then cool. If it's something else that's fine too but it needs to happen for the game to appeal to a broader audience.

The main thing is not giving long term players a big advantage over new players. Otherwise with how easy it is to get to ""endgame"" this game would need to wipe every 2-3 months."
Immortan-Moe-Bro,This is one of the better ideas I’ve seen

GhettoKroenen,"I like the thought, but unless if you are planning on extracting after destroying a couple of ships, the end result stays the same. If you disable a ship and get boarded by 4 people who can’t open the cockpit door, you have to leave at some point if you are ever going to enter a raid. Either way, it still ends in you being breached and a fight happening in someones ship, which was the main reason for suggesting the initial breach change.

Cool idea, but I don’t think it necessarily tackles the main issue people have with breaching. Being that it doesn’t reward the winner with anything because they’ll just get breached and have to fight inside anyways."
k33g0rz,"The biggest problem for me with good ships is getting breached yhen bombed by 3rd party.

This is easy to fix by adding inate blast armor to higher level ships"
NoBullfrog2,Just add breaching charges into the game already. Explosives need to make a bigger appearance in this game.
_pippp,u/metthedoc I'm sure you guys have seen plenty of suggestions on this but I've personally not seen this one before!

One-Philosopher8711,"I've stopped playing until they add hirable NPCs for your ships. That is 100% the coolest idea I've seen in the suggestions since I started playing, but I get the feeling it'll be too much of a technical sink for these devs to pull off, so more than likely I won't be returning."
