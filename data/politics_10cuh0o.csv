grixorbatz,Especially when his friends are enemies of the United States
,"If John Kelly had to repeatedly ""remind"" Trump, then Trump certainly did this repeatedly because Kelly wasn't with him 24/7 for four years. Besides, ""remind"" is the wrong word. Trump knew he shouldn't do what he was doing. He just didn't give a shit."
fowlraul,"‚Ä¶and he was ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with Kim Jong-un too, so that‚Äôs pretty terrific."
-ChiefLongBeef-,"Knowing trump, he went around showing everything with eyes those classified documents just because he thought he was special."
thistimelineisweird,I actually find it funny that people think Trump has friends.
JadedIT_Tech,"This is the difference between the two of them having classified documents.

Now shut up about it"
RobDickinson,His friend Vladimir ?
Boonzies,To Trump it's like sharing a menu at the local Chinese take out place.
AdvertisingBrave5457,Because of course he did
Bluerecyclecan,Which means he did because Kelly certainly wasn‚Äôt around him 100% of the time.
NotReallyFamous5,BuT HunDeR BidaNs LaBToB!!!
DeerDiarrhea,"‚ÄúHe said I can‚Äôt **share** classified information, but he didn‚Äôt say I can‚Äôt *sell* classified information.‚Äù - Donald J. Trump, almost certainly"
whatsgoodforme,Meaning he violates that oath repeatedly with no consequence? Kelly would have to repeatedly warn him if he wasn‚Äôt repeatedly doing illegal crap. Why are we still dancing around here. This guys gotta pay for his crimes.
Isocratia,And he had to dodge squirts of ketchup every time he said that.
eggs4breakfasy,Surely nobody is surprised.
1Sluggo,So is this Kelly trying to reclaim his reputation?
255001434,Classified documents looked like stacks of money to Trump.
sunnydaysahead2022,They all failed. They all knew it. They all let Trump fuck us all over.
hikeonpast,Trump has friends?
Rare-Lime2451,Another classic stable genius moment.
louiloui152,Great so now we know Trump shared plenty üòÖ because he full well didn‚Äôt listen to Kelly when he wasn‚Äôt in the room
,He didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶.he has no friends ‚Ä¶.even his kids are starting to keep their distance
anywho123,That‚Äôs the difference between him and Biden. Mishandling of classified documents is an atrocity that needs to be dealt with. Blatantly sharing classified secrets because you‚Äôre trying to impress your golf buddies is something else.
CaptainAxiomatic,Or enemies.
Kennydoe,So glad we know this 5 years too late.  Fucking cowards in that administration.
freddie_merkury,"Repeatedly....

It's insane that this man was President and how many people voted for him."
BoltgunOnHisHip,I'm just waiting for the day Trump finally goes on Truth and starts talking about how Oswald was our guy.
ToucanFarthing,"Reminded him after he had already shared it, of course. Thus, why he had to keep reminding him."
yabadabadoo80,Trump has friends?!
FunkmasterJoe,"I mean, yeah.


Like we all completely knew this was happening the entire time, right? Trump doesn't understand (or try to, he doesn't really listen to anyone unless they're kissing his ass IN THAT MOMENT) procedure around sensitive information, doesn't know which info he's received is or isn't sensitive, and honestly I think he probably doesn't understand WHY these procedures exist. 


He's really, really dumb and also has dementia. Watch him try to read something sometime, it's pretty wild."
AtuinTurtle,"‚ÄúBut chose to keep doing so.‚Äù Why do we allow Trump to get off as some hapless idiot? Once is a mistake, repeatedly is an intentional action."
someguy233,"Unfortunately the sitting president *can* share classified information with whomever they want. That‚Äôs the scary part about all of this. As a civilian he no longer has that authority, but you know he‚Äôs gonna keep on doing it‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs really frustrating that the hordes of GQP on twitter willingly conflate sharing something classified with declassifying. 

No matter how many times you tell them ‚Äúif those documents were truly declassified, then they‚Äôre by law publicly available. FOIA them and prove to everyone that he actually declassified them‚Äù, they just mindlessly say ‚Äúthe president can declassify anything they want‚Äù. As if he‚Äôs an eternal president or something. 

They usually have something about ‚Äúowning the libs‚Äù in their bios too."
highfriend90,"Arrest him already god, somehow Biden investigation is moving faster then trumps,"
sonny9636,What did he share with Putin? Good grief..
DeadPoster,"""But I'm the bestest friends with Putin. He said so himself!"""
r_kelly_bathbomb,"Do any of these friends include Saudis, Russians, or Chinese billionaires?"
LAESanford,"And trump‚Äôs instinctual reaction would have been, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt tell me what to do, *I* am the *President*! I do what I want‚Äù"
FitziTheArtist,All I heard all day on msnbc was about Biden documents. This story wasn‚Äôt mentioned once.
Awkward_Village_6871,I am shocked. Shocked I say.
Hot-Bint,What friends? You mean MAL hanger ons?
mharjo,This man is a walking stupid bomb.
Cheshire_Jester,"‚ÄúSo the thing is, I mentally declassify everything before I share it, then mentally reclassify it if I have to, it‚Äôs beautiful really.  So effective.‚Äù"
celerydonut,This dude really fucked the country in a big way. Kevin McCarthy praising him and thanking him the other day is some seriously scary shit.
lazrbeam,...which means he definitely told and sold some highly classified shit. Lol. Great.
foodude84,Just remember Kelly was Chief of Staff from August 2017-July 2019. It's safe to assume that Trump was showing classified documents to unauthorized people before Kelly and after Kelly left. This is why it's so incredibly important that the National Archives has the complete visitors log for the White House. Anyone who had an appointment to meet with Trump was possibly/probably shown secret/classified documents that they shouldn't have seen.
Shurae,"And if he does it, what are the consequences? Because to me it looks like there are almost no real consequences to anything he does besides some slaps on the wrist."
Shr3kk_Wpg,"I know conservatives will say ""But the President can declassify anything just by thinking about it"". But that isn't the point. Just because someone can do something, doesn't mean they should. Documents are classified for various reasons. Sharing classified information willy nilly is *irresponsible*. Declassifying documents and information on a whim is *irresponsible*. We should demand more from the President"
Very_ImportantPerson,I still can‚Äôt believe he was Americas President
Lovellry,Which means he probably did it anyway.
HiddenSquid7392,"Just think about all the times Kelly wasn‚Äôt there to ‚Äúremind‚Äù this asshole, scary thoughts"
justforthearticles20,Trump held highly sensitive meetings and phone calls in the middle of crowds at Mar-a-Lago. Kelly and Trump's Secret Service Goons facilitated their Messiah's sharing of classified information.
cmgchamp2,"Trump sharing classified docs with friends?

Oh you mean friends like Kim Jong-un or Vladimir Putin, huh.

Right Repubs?"
mces97,So Trump 100% shared classified information with friends. Got it.
ManMadeMyth,Trump** has friends?
devo_inc,"Any other job, normal people would have been fired on the spot."
Dogs-wearing_Hats,I‚Äôm sure he did anyways
kobeyoboy,Sometimes u can‚Äôt just keep it to yourself. /s
ShannonBaggMBR,Pro transparency üëçüèº
scribblingsim,"Considering he‚Äôs friends with every dictator on the planet, that‚Äôs pretty terrifying. Weren‚Äôt some of the documents he stole related to nuclear secrets?"
kwdreewes40,Anyone notice the House voted for a 35k raise and abolished the ethics committee?
a-really-cool-potato,Put this criminal in prison and isolate him as a national security threat
dayswonder,He was so unfit to be president it hurts to think about.
Baketovens_Fifth,Trump doesn‚Äôt have friends. He has co-conspirators.
aresef,"He loved sharing this stuff as a way to brag about all the neat things he knew. He blabbed off about Israeli intelligence to Sergey Lavrov, spilled the location of a nuclear sub to Rodrigo Duterte. He *cannot* be trusted with the nation's secrets."
girlnamedtom,"How could anyone be surprised by this? Honestly, he‚Äôs that fucking stupid."
tilehinge,"But yeah, we're supposed to give a shit that Biden had - and voluntarily returned - a couple papers."
kitchen_clinton,Trump is a traitor. Who knows what he gave the Russians for the few rubies he got.
-AngryPope,"This is sad, but not at all surprising."
Davis51,"John Kelly continues his rehab tour to make his over racism, lies, and opportunistic ladder climbing seem not so bad by reminding us that all this heinous shit happened in his vicinity and he did nothing to blow the whistle."
Bert_Macklin86,The most shocking thing from this report is he has friends
Blurry12yo,"Nonsense, of course he can. 

For it is written in the gospel of Boebert 1:15: Then trump made a hole-in-one from 1,229 yards, and he turned to Kim Jong-Un and said, ‚ÄúDo you want to know a secret?‚Äù and told him about nuclear codes, and because he spoke them became miraculously no longer secrets.

Amen."
idontagreewitu,"My parents liked Trump. Not to the level of his crazy followers, they didn't send him money or buy his merch, but they thought he was a good President. Until the reports about him proclaiming things declassified. My mom spent the late 80s and early 90s declassifying documents for DOD contracts her employer had, and she knew all about sanitizing information and the like. That's when she finally realized he was a bullshitter."
horrorsd,Define ‚Äúfriends‚Äù
Roasted_Butt,It‚Äôs okay. He declassified it in his mind.
RobinsDad,"Who cares? Nothing is ever going to happen to the man.  
It‚Äôs been 2+ years since the election.  It‚Äôs been 6 years since he took office, and multiple stories of poor judgement, questionable matters and yet here we are, still reading stories."
new-6reddit9,Treason!
bndboo,"Just think, we had this living, breathing, national security liability and we still don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs at Area 51."
aztronut,"Trump doesn't have friends, he has transactional associates."
ramdom-ink,"That may be so. But it is so depressing that the DOJ‚Äôs case became so much more difficult (maybe even a moot point) with the discovery that Biden had classified files in the closet and for bathroom reading or out in the garage or whatever, too. For fuck‚Äôs sake. That was the one criminal oversight and negligence that I thought would finally nail Trump‚Äôs ass to the wall. Now, it‚Äôs just so much less than what it could‚Äôve been. They might *(might)* get Trump on obstruction, but even that looks sketchier and more distant now. Biden blew it."
MAMAG23BEAUTIES,And Biden's is extremely confident ü§£
Clienterror,Why not? I mean I get why he shouldn't but why should he or anyone care? If anything good has come out of the Trump presidency it's that politicians can do anything they want with no consequences.
maluminse,"üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ

What timing. Let's bring back up Trumps classified documents to deflect/distract from Biden's classified documents mess."
TylerDexter,"Lol, didn't happen.  This is disinformation to try to distract from bidens carelessness with classified documents.  They are finding them all over. Biden is spiraling the bowl and of course the main stream media is "" but look at Trump!"""
QuintessentialNorton,"Lost credibility at ""NYT journalist says"""
vllVaLllv,Still on this guy years later huh?
King-Sassafrass,The president doesn‚Äôt have the power of free speech?
AwTekker,"What a weird coincidence this story comes out right now, when we've discovered that Biden had loads of classified documents just sitting around, too!"
northernedge24,"Enough with this double standard! It's Biden that has just been caught with classified documents. Classified documents he illegally took as VP (which is criminal, as he had no powers then to declassify them unlike the ones found on Trump who had the power to declassify them)"
FUMFVR,This isn't true though. Trump could share it with whoever he wanted. He was the classification authority. This is something people need to think about when voting for a meme to be President.
Glad_Air_558,Isn‚Äôt it suspiciously that we get inundated with trump posts whenever something dodgy comes up with Biden? (More classified docs)
Firecracker048,"Please, keep deflecting on the fact that our current president had Classified documents, even top secret ones, in his offices spread across the country for *6* years and not once did the national archives flag it."
sfmcinm0,"Except:  As president, he was the final authority on classified info (except for certain Atomic secrets). So legally, he could do that.  Definitely not ethically or morally."
corran450,‚ÄúYes I can! I‚Äôm President^^TM ! I can declassify just by thinking about it!‚Äù
Scopy,"As bad as this is it‚Äôs true, we literally all know it"
PlasticAlfalfa1,"I have a feeling that putin, kim jong space man, Pooh bear xi, and that Saudi dude aren‚Äôt real friends :)"
SirPwn4g3,"A cording to Fox News, the president can say anything he wants."
nochinzilch,"How patriotic of him to tell us years after we can do anything about it.  If he had an ounce of backbone, he would have said something at the time."
almanagil,We have to know the circumstances with Biden before we judge we already knows Trumps
Unclebuttstuff,Chump is weapons grade dog shit
N0T8g81n,"One has to wonder whether Priebus, Mulvaney or Meadows expressed similar concerns. Maybe Priebus, but I figure the others just *let Trump be Trump*."
OGRaysireks987,Which means he totally did
roboticfedora,And he was in a room with Putin.
matmanz,"Which means he definitely did, multiple times."
FarceMultiplier,"This fucker doesn't understand object permanence, don't trust him with secrets. Geez."
sfmcinm0,"True, just saying the rw defense - even though I'm a Democrat. I remember when Carter declassified a satellite picture of a Soviet ship and how up in arms they were about it then. How the turn tables."
Round_Rooms,When you vote idiots into office you get idiocy
door_to_nowhere_,And he did it anyways
dastufishsifutsad,"So surprising. 
Why do we have to continue to find out this dude had NO ability to protect our country? 
He should‚Äôve been cast out as soon as he went into hiding with the Russian officials in the Oval Office?"
Different_Cod_1394,No shit
metallipunk,"While you still have the rubes saying ""but Hunter Biden's laptop."" and saying Biden's found docs being the worst thing to ever happen in the history of man."
rustyseapants,Trump: but the ice cream!
HardcoreKaraoke,"Well the guy has shown for decades that he loves attention. He has a massive ego and will brag about his accomplishments even when he is lying through his teeth. 

So of course behind the scenes he is probably a million times worse. Instead of just telling a crowd of hicks that his businesses are successful he probably spent a lot of time at Mar-a-Lago bragging to his ""friends"" about his Presidential secrets. The guy can't keep his mouth shut in front of a crowd of unimpressive people, you just know he was trying to impress his rich ""friends"" with confidential information."
hellochristopher,Does anyone have that copy pasta of all the corrupt shit trump has done
nuffced,What an idiot.
shrekerecker97,"Which means that he probably did, because sir tweets-a-lot doesn‚Äôt know how stfu"
tickandzesty,Looks like he did it any way.
MeepMoop08,Lol ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù
gofuggyoself,John Kelly... Let's trump shit on his sons legacy.
ShewTheMighty,"I met Mr.Kelly a number of years ago. I requested to be excused from any personal meetings on the grounds that I did not agree with, support, or want any involvement in his venture at the time. I did at least attend a brief impromptu speaking session.

His recollections of working in the Trump White House, while very polite, we're not exactly kind. A few of the comments that stuck with me were to the effect of  ""Baby sitting a toddler with nuclear code"" ""Trying to conduct a train where the rails were constantly removed from in front of you."" ""Sometimes it felt like we spent more time trying to put the train back on the tracks than actually making progress."" ""He's a business man, he didn't know how the government worked and he didn't know what it meant when someone said he couldn't do something."" These are not direct quotes but they are in the ball park.

Funny enough he managed to flip this into some kind of odd ball message about overcoming difficulty in a work place. My CEO ate it up."
SquirrelDumplins,Trump has an IQ of 30
Bacchus1976,"This implies that he ‚Äúforgot‚Äù. No, he did not forget."
spookycasas4,"Gee, Kelly might have mentioned this soon."
mrRabblerouser,Narrator: he did anyway‚Ä¶
,You‚Äôre pretty much dead from the neck up if you‚Äôre still going this clown money and want to vote for him again.
xT1TANx,How did he know he was going to share it and how is he sure he never did?
fairelectionsnofraud,Deflection as usual...
ProgRock1956,"Of course he did, DJT is a dense idiot."
Dry-Independence9400,Because‚Ä¶.. Because of course he did.
HumberGrumb,"Burn, baby, burn!  üî•"
dullship,Oh cool. cool cool cool.
gmom525,"Sadly, the admonitions were meaningless. He neither heeded nor cared."
nevillion,Haha wrong guy to give anything classified to. Trump want to be the best and the coolest dude in any space he‚Äôs in. What make you think he‚Äôll shut up when he knows very well he has an information no one else around has
Forged_Originals,"I met John Kelly once and the eldritch entity that controls him. Interesting pair, considering."
Purple_Cauliflower11,What cannot understand is why so many people think he is great.  I get the rich massive tax breaks. He did nothing for average income people.
canon12,Kelly learned that you cannot win a pissing contest with an idiot.
APEHASKILLEDAPE,"Someone should tell this to Biden before it‚Äôs too la‚Ä¶., it‚Äôs to late."
Character_Heart_9196,The orange stain does what he does to stay in the spotlight .
Redketchup77,This world has become a joke.
rocksalt131,"Kelly, a cancer and too little too late"
dreadthripper,Trump reacts like it's the first time anyone told him every single time.
Farty_Nonsense,"Trump probably had to be constantly reminded to wear pants and how to wipe his ass properly because he‚Äôs very stupid, it‚Äôs because of all the holes in his brain from the years and years of cocaine and syphilis."
True-Atheist,‚Ä¶but my friend Vladimir said it is okay‚Ä¶
nenulenu,"Tone fair, I don‚Äôt think hood press brain can retain inconvenient information very long."
Cinnamon1330,Any I'm absolutely positive Trump didn't comply.
Fancy-Armadillo-2792,Who gets to decide if something is classified?
routerg0d,Remember when he was doing it at mar a lago while a raid was going on?
doomvetch92,"He has the biggest mouth, I swear."
grimatongueworm,Trump doesn‚Äôt have any friends.
ProjectFantastic1045,"‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre classy enough, I‚Äôll share it with you. You‚Äôve got to have some class.  Not too much. No one has as much class as me.‚Äô  - TD, probs"
Dchama86,I‚Äôm just glad Trump doesn‚Äôt drink‚Ä¶we‚Äôd probably all be speaking Russian right now.
cmelms,I feel like when asking if you can get a top secret clearance they should add that Trump got it. Lol.
Sad_Bolt,Hope someone is telling Biden this now since his keep popping up everywhere
bcallihan513,Probably had to remind him to stop eating paint and to change his diaper too
ChHeBoo,Shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult as he has no friends.
Jaanhi84,He has friends?
Serious-Courage-1961,Oh Jesus ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
sirscrote,I wish John Kelly would say more. He is a retired general is he not? Spill the beans as to why you left.
Cmdeadly,"Not saying I like Trump, but clients dad is a member at mar a lago and is a friend of Trump, they had dinner with him and one of the stories was. Which keep in mind this is all second hand.

Trump met with a leader of a group, I don't remember the name of a middle eastern group, they met in a room with a large table in the middle as they were discussing. Trump pulled out an ar design tablet and sat it out in front of the other leader. With a design of the leaders home and family out front. Said if one of our soldiers were touched we will take you out. The guy didn't understand and after getting frustrated Trump goes. If one of our soldiers gets touched BOOM, leader goes Ohhhhh I get it.

Whole point is, Trump doesn't give a damn about classified information."
OldTechnician,I'm wondering if this is why Biden had classified documents -- to keep them away from the Trump organization.
,[removed]
LoneWolfYODA,This is literally fake news
georgiafan14,Meanwhile biden had classified docs in his garage but no big deal
thesaltydumpling,"You guys do know that the president CAN DO ANYTHING HE WANTS WITH CLASSIFIED INFO?

That is LITERALLY part of his job description.  The president decides WHAT is declass and WITH WHOM to share it.

Not some pointy haired middle manager or some marx reading communist simpathizer that needs to be brought up for treason, general.

Anyone have any clue how the presidency works here?"
CycleChris2,"Trump is the least of our problems. He was a president. The presidential records act gives presidents broad authority on documents. In Fitton vs US, a case seeking audio tapes Bill Clinton took and stored in a sock drawer the court held the president has broad authority to declare documents personal. Contrast Hillary‚Äôs server open to the Chinese and Bidens classified docs in Hunters garage for 6 years. Vps loose secret service protection after 6 months. The place was not anything as secure as MAL."
repoman138,Rent free.
Major_Magazine8597,"I heard someone suggested that the Republicans planted this stuff in Biden's locations.    That would be CRAZY, wouldn't it?    I mean, crazy, right?"
Shonuff8,"Technically, the president can do whatever they want with classified and secret information while president.

Doesn‚Äôt mean they should."
Anarchris427,Sounds like something a Chief of Staff ought to be doing. Kinda like reminding Uncle Joe how to find his way off a stage.
SnooHobbies5684,"WTF is with this lack of capitalization and horrible punctuation?!  


""Schmidt added: ""Here's the chief of staff to the president of the united state concerned that the president of the united states could damage national security. Remember the president of the united states is in charge of protecting the country, but Trump behaved in such an abnormal, immoral way in Kelly's eye that he didn't trust what Trump would do."""""
