EpilepticDentist,"A stoppable force meets an easily movable object.


Edit: Also this is pretty much the same when you pvp several dozen hours into the game atleast for me. You both panickingly mag dump one another when you first see each other and just awkwardly circle around each other and praying that you can reload your weapon first and kill them."
24Scoops,Unless I'm blind I see a ceramic level 4 body armour under his Tac Rig. You're shooting some form of buckshot which other than flechette has almost no pen. You aimed center mass the entire time so basically his armour was eating all your shots. Aim for the legs or face in this scenario.
waFFLEz_,"You just need to work on your point fire and you'll be fine. 

And you need to play to the ammo you are using. with 7mm buck you wanna go for head or leg shots.

If you were using something like flechette you would have killed him ages a go with those thorax shots"
twuit,"these are the best fights, 1 min shoot outs and you arent even mad afterwards

the most frustrating thing is getting onetaped out of nowhere 20 min into the raid"

Dilbert-Actual,"Hot take, people saying ‚ÄúADS‚Äù are (sort of) wrong. At close range, ADS just slows you down. Just practice point firing for close range. Not saying imitating streamers is how you play the game, but watch other people PVP. It honestly helped me a lot."
Illtakeboffum,Laughed way too much at this
Matto_boi,Yeah that was awful lmao
Guilty-Resist-509,This is usually me but i've been playing for 3 wipes... Just wait for the PTSD to kick in and you start seeing stuff that isn't there (This is not a exaggeration or a joke). Enjoy though you did fine.
AWAYeez,Maybe lower sensitivity a little bit? You got unlucky with the fact that he had lvl 4 armor and you had a blacked arm but you also could have performed better. I‚Äôd suggest turning that laser on or quickly aiming for a bit more precision and attempt a headshot. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve had just as embarrassing moments though !
Mindset_,bro why wont you ads
Embarrassed-Equal-19,Atleast your getting to play streets haha.

jessesomething,"Love these kinda shootouts! Usually we just end up talking to each other and saying like ""I'm gonna go this way, and we can just call it a draw lmao"""
Zerleodon,"One huge tip with shotguns, if you see they have armor. Aim for the legs. Buckshot don‚Äôt do shit to armor. You hit em in the legs. It‚Äôll just be 1-2 shots. Also try out lasers. Or a laser light combo"
animal1988,This was REALLY funny to watch.
Mightypeon-1Tapss,"this death can be improved because it was your fault, some deaths are literally tarkov‚Äôd like desync cheaters stuttering"

Pirat_fred,"Why the fuck dosent he use the sights? 

I mean sure hip firing is important but he had plenty of time to aim...."
JewPhone_WhoDis,Stop scav on scav violence
DiamondNinja4,FYI: scavs can randomly have 2x or 3x health
edge449332,"Buckshot is more effective if you aim for the unarmored areas, the only time you should be aiming center of mass is if they are not wearing a face shield, so that when your weapon recoils, you hopefully get some BB's into their face. 

But don't feel bad that you feel shit at the game. Everyone was shit at the game when they started, ***its a hard game***. But the game being that hard is what gives you those adrenaline rushes that you crave when you survive a raid, or wipe a squad. 

Believe me, when you have your first huge raid, it will all be worth it. The reason why I love Tarkov so much, is because the skill gap is far less your actual gun skill, and far more the knowledge of the game. A player with Good map, gun and ammo knowledge, but has poor aim can outplay a player with good aim, and bad knowledge a solid 90% of the time."
Fair_Extension5021,"I am not trying to come in here and say this have never happened to me, cause' it absolutely have. But I still screamed ""ADS DUDE!!"" to the monitor after like the 12:th shot xD 

Lovely clip and thanks for sharing <3"
WosiohanS,1179 dmg absorbed by armor XD
idontwantnametoo,just pull thru im edging 1500 hours and just start to get good at pvp
Clippers1002,Damn this gives me flashbacks of woods with a bolt action
,"1) half of the meta is abuse of bad movement mechanics, lag and desyncs

2) the directional audio is absolute shit

3) the ballistics/penetration are out of this world unrealistic

4) the recoil/aiming is so broken that it's actually better to hipfire at certain ranges

5) medical gameplay is next level stupid 

You aren't shit at the game. The game is shit at being a game."
retronax,"""1200 damage absorbed by armor"" in this game you could throw boulders from catapults directly at people and if the boulder didn't have enough pen they would be fine"
beau261,Shit! I never laughed so hard in a while.
Zer0Cyber_YT,"Step one. This isn't Call of duty, you would have killed this guy if you had an assault rifle with how many shots you put into his chest, in this game buckshot has no armor penetration so essentially your doing ZERO damage to him by blasting his chest with your shotgun. If your going to use a shotgun, use makeshift BMG slugs or AP-20 slugs, but if you want to use buckshot aim for their legs, where they have no armor."
GreNaderz,bro please ads
InterlockingPain,From what I learned on here.  Always aim for the crotch.
CoochieMan747464,AAAAAA JUST FUCKING ADS
Bubzyleet,You should try aiming.
skcuf2,"At least you're playing your PMC. My friend won't play his PMC in online raids. He says he doesn't care if he dies. ""I'm not scared."" ""Then just do it."" ""I don't want to.""

Man's got some deep issues. ""I just don't think I like PvP games."" Yeah...because you're not competitive, don't like risk and aren't good at the game because you don't try. No one is going to like PvP if you don't even try and always get shit on."
jd52995,It helps when you click the right mouse button to aim down sights or maybe put the enemies head right in the middle of your screen.
selelee,ok im not the only one. gonna stop crying.
Dudinkalv,You know you have a right mouse button right?
No-Phase2131,"Lol. 
How many shots did you hit? 
Doenst look right."

Nightman2417,"The reason I go back and play Tarkov from them to time is because of how bad I am at it lol. I‚Äôve had my moments and good runs of form, but I am in it for the experience as a whole. No other FPS makes you feel as immersed or jump as much as EFT"
LeagueLy,What are you using to record? Your clip is very crisp
Bap1811,"If you're running buckshot of any kind, assume they have armor and go for legs or the head. Almost any armor will absorb just about an infinite amount of buckshot, as you have now seen.


If you'd put 2 solid blasts into his legs at any point, he'd be dead. Or a faceshot. 


Dont be afraid to ads to hit your leg shots with shotguns though, its a good idea. This was shotty vs shotty but against rifles/smgs if you peak out and hit a solid shot, you have so much more damage than he does on one round, so trading 1 shot for 1 shot is a good idea, just don't get tapped in the head. 


In general one solid magnum buck to the legs at close range is a guaranteed ""hes totally fucked"" and can one shot, especially if you also hit the stomach, 2 is pretty much guaranteed dead."
Suspicious-Cucumber9,Can You pls use the fucking right click?
banmeplscantstop,That was hard to watch holy shi
Alpha433,That looks like a klesch laser light module. Why weren't you using the laser sight? Would have made tapping his head or legs so much easier.
bertos55,"Good try, 7.5 buck is trash, try and find some magnum buck or some slugs and go at it again. I‚Äôve had a lot of fun running magnum fuckshot early wipe."
Successful-Ad4737,"Look man trust me
Whene I started playing I was worse than your average scav
Then I stopped playing for 3 months 
Whene I got back on I was so much better
Tip. Play cod worzone to help practice."
J10Blandi,Holy fuck you missed like 60% of those shots
Harding3D,Don't be afraid to back away from a fight!
theteaharvester,Is this aquafps?
Lee_Roy_Jenkins_69,Mate im sorry but this is tarkov. It is Designed to feel like a kick in the nuts
sc0tt3h,Damn you really missed like every single shot lol. There wasn't one shot that was clean on him
V1rusH0st,Truly amazing.
SparePair3916,I remember the early days haha. Keep going my man! You will be grabbing that phat loot soon enough.
Accomplished-Piece81,welcome to tarkov homie
Koozer,Bad luck dude i was rooting for you!
beerbaron105,OMG what terrible players lol
_-_-_-hotmemes-_-_-_,bro when i tell you i was crying laughing at the end
DropDeddBlue,"Man I wanted to see how much damage was absorbed by armor ü§£

Remember even the shittiest guns will work out as long as you use the right ammo. For shotguns an AP shell makes the world of difference"
Iwanderandiamlost,"Tarkov has the worst ""new player"" experience I've ever had."
Glum-Sheepherder-255,Uninstall the game bro.. and sell the account
ethrelol,Damn bro you‚Äôre almost as bad as I am üòéüòé
ForwardToNowhere,"BSG needs to add blunt damage so badly. I get that he was wearing what looks like class 4 body armor, but that amount of buckshot fired point-blank into anyone's chest would shatter all of their ribs and turn their organs into a mush. Nobody is standing up after that, let alone shooting back."
Conbain,The games trash man. I‚Äôve been playing for a little over a year now and like honestly idc if this gets me sent to oblivion. The game is fucking ass.
MootsUncle,Damage absorbed by armor 1179. Fucking lollll
xSam0202,"I‚Äôm fairly new, but I never get in these kind of fights. Just one shot, head, eyes. Wonder how woeful I‚Äôll be in this kind of situation though"
the_wenoodle,Try using the laser over flashlight
MiguelCC1,Plz aim for the love of God
EngiNERD1988,"LOL ive had some bad encounters, but never this bad"
MyPostsHitDifferent,Wish I could confirm or deny this is Tarkov. I have a 3060 TI which means I'll never see this map. Not at least for another three years. I still get massive frame drops on Lighthouse.

MrLynchmob01,7mm rounds really be down bad.

GamingApokolips,"""Sweep the leg, Johnny, sweep the leg."" 

If you're running a shotgun, always always go for the legs.

^(Unless you're running fletchette or AP-20s...then it doesn't really matter where you shoot them.)"
ItalianStallion9069,Trying aiming
Never-Shower,"you're shooting shells with no penetration into his armor. Should've gone for the face, and I know that's easier said than done but... I would argue there was plenty of time. Either that or shoot his legs in this kind of situation.

He was pretty shit too lmao it was fun to watch. But yeah, next time shoot unarmored areas."

IidasAdventures,What a ride.
RandMart68,Y‚Äôall were both player scavsüòÇ
RedditCorbo,I constantly remind myself to slow down and aim true. I win a lot more fights when I take the time to aim.
sleepy_the_fish,"Holy shit ! I thought you where fighting Ai that whole time.  Come to find out it was another real person too on the other side lmao.  You're new so it's understandable but that other guy better be fucking new too.    I think he was wearing level 4 armor.  I also  saw your hit count was 30.  You did kill before that fight so I'd say like 20 hits on that fight ?  I'm guessing you where using normal buckshot  ammo on someone with level 4 armor.  In that case you are better off aiming for the legs.    If you are hurt, run away, find somewhere safe, and then stop your bleeding and then heal your wounded area and then come back to fight.   Having your bandage keybinds to quickly stop your bleed, and then a heal keybinds as well to quickly get off a heal around the corner, would of probably got you the win"
Responsible-Rock9415,Shoot to the legs or tithe head with a shotgun
Sqwdx,"Yeh bro, to be fair it‚Äôs not just you, you both suck! So I guess it‚Äôs not that bad right ?"
JimmyJazzz1977,Pure nightmare to watch :D

Thepotionguy,"Right click, dude"
Shmoits,This is the funniest thing I've seen all week.
ShoulderQuick9618,LMAO
VampViking,Watching this made me glad I quit playing this game lol
TheDutchDemon,The real victory here is that you're able to play Streets.
Thin_Veterinarian_35,Tarkov is a game of learning. Simply do better. Thats 100% the game. Until its not. Until you get a 40mm grenade through a crack in the hole in the windows of crackhouse from stronghold by a shitstain smoking a pipe full of crack.
HeavyCaregiver1924,STAY STRONG KING. IT ONLY GETS WORSE FROM HERE
FloridaCracker91,I still don't fuckin understand how people are even playing on streets. What the fuck
lostnfoundskate,Lol any other game that would be a kill right
Alternative_Air_4511,ALSO...nobody has mentioned....that there's a hack out in which aiming at anything other than feet won't even hurt certain players.
NubCak1,"lol bro, is this your first FPS game?  


Your aim is pepega.  


You don't even know what your ammo is good for."
