{"Title": "Rant: I've played since second ever wipe, and I believe the game is a shell of what it once was.", "Post Text": "I've played every wipe and seen every update.  Some more than others, but I have played them all, barring the very first wipe ever.    \n\n\nI can count on one hand the number of game updates I felt were a good addition to the game.  Every year I come back to tarkov to find that the game is simply less good that it was the year before.     \n\n\nThis is not to say that other games that are coming out are slowly getting better than this game which is slowly becoming dated.  I mean to say that Escape from Tarkov, 3 years ago, was an inherently more enjoyable experience.  Not being locked to 3 guns thats are worth using, having big key rooms to go loot late in raid at night like a rat, or fight off spawn at like a chad.  The choice was mine to make, I could play in any way i wished.  They've slowly pulled every fun thing out of the game for me.    \n\n\nThere are so few systems that BSG has added that has made me enjoy the game, my once favorite game of all time is slowly becoming just not fun at all.    \n\n\nBeing unable to place anything of note at all on flea market, my favorite map Interchange having no reason to hit the big key rooms due to massive nerfs, changes to Killa that make it impossible to fight back without sheer luck, flea market nerfs to having basically no slots which inadvertently forces more main menu and stash time instead of raid time...  recoil changes making every gun but 3 completely unusable...  almost every major change has just made the game feel... *worse*.  Every wipe i consider more and more about uninstalling the game forever and calling it over.   \n\n\nBSG seems to be almost unable to make a change that feels positive to me.  Cheaters are more rampant than ever, they are releasing maps that over 70% of the playerbase can barely run....  \n\n\nThis really feels like PUBG 2.0.  The downfall of a great concept.  Terrible companies that lucked out with a great concept for a game that fail to improve on it and become stubborn and prideful... It's seriously just so upsetting to see it happen to Tarkov too.    \n\n\nAnyway, just had to rant. I'm done.\n\n/rant.\n\nEdit: someone literally reported my account as a suicide risk after this post lmao", "ID": "10afdgu", "Score": 1755, "Total Comments": 894, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10afdgu/rant_ive_played_since_second_ever_wipe_and_i/"}
