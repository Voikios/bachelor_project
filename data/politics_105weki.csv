ravengenesis1,And somehow police have no suspects or motives.
MacaronMelodic,This is a pretty big fucking deal and likely just the beginning of what will be normalized.
BlotchComics,https://archive.ph/2dDeB
DelTrigger,"Remember when that guy asked, ""When do we get to use the guns?"" to Charlie Kirk? The right wing rhetoric will push all the way to just before violence, but the footsoldiers will do the rest."

macinnis,This is terrorism
MachineCode86,"Strange how the people who in the 00s made commercials slandering anyone who bought or used recreational drugs as a terrorist or supporter of terrorism, refuse to call direct acts politically motivated violence that very same term"
PM_Me_Your_Sidepods,"Call it what it is, this was a terrorist attack."

malkavich,Violent Republicans as usual.
ShenmeNamaeSollich,"Hmm, well, maybe it‚Äôs a coincidence & not political because they live in crappy neighborhoods? 

>‚Äùat least eight shots were fired at the home of State Senator Linda Lopez ‚Ä¶ 

>more than a dozen gunshot impacts ‚Ä¶ at the house of [a county commissioner]‚Ä¶

>‚Ä¶ eight rounds fired at the home of [another county commissioner in the same county]

schwinn140,"""The authorities are investigating whether they were related and politically motivated.""

 smh"
EggplantGlittering90,"The GOP is a terrorist organization, not a political party."
WeBeFooked,Amazing this isn‚Äôt a bigger story. We are normalizing political violence by allowing it without any accountability. We‚Äôre done as a nation once the reds and blues start killing each other‚Ä¶..
Neidan1,When are they going to call it what it is? right wing domestic terrorism.
new_nimmerzz,"This is what the right wing Q extremists are going to start to do. If you go on their websites they say it all the time. Things like ""its time to stop talking and start shooting"". Go there and see for yourself. They're inciting each other to violence."
theduchessofawesome,"So I think the police don‚Äôt want to do much about these attacks since their candidate for governor, former weatherman Mark Ronchetti (or Wrong-chetti as us locals called him) lost. The local police have been very anti Michelle Lujan-Grisham."

That can‚Äôt be a coincidence, right?"
Charyou-Tree,"The media in this country is like the teachers in a high school ignoring the classroom bullies, but throwing the book at their victims if they hit back. 

Christofascist terrorists try to assassintate political leaders? Kid gloves.

Ordinary people protesting because cops murdered a man in broad daylight on video? EVIL ANTIFA RIOTERS ARE COMING TO EAT YOUR BABY!"

HodlMyBottle,Dang! Antifa at it again!? üòè/s
Adddicus,"\>>The authorities are investigating whether they were related and politically motivated.

Nah, probably just coincidence.

\>>The department did not announce the shootings earlier, he said, because it was not clear in December whether there might be a pattern.

Or because the officers involved still had more targets on their list.

\>>The state police were also involved, officials said.

As investigators or perpetrators? 

Hey, I'm just asking questions!"

Slow_Association_162,"Lets not put influential and wealthy republican seditionists in prison I'm sure that won't backfire.....let's allow them to keep their positions and participate in elections despite inciting insurrection against the government and its citizens. I'm sure the supporters of sediton won't become emboldened, I'm sure the seditionists in office won't be working internally to destabilize the country.

2 years after j6."
BunnieSPH,"They‚Äôre playing with fire.
New Mexico has a nearly 50% gun ownership.

thistimelineisweird,One could argue that targeting an elected representative is treason.
gamerdudeNYC,"Well obviously it‚Äôs just some strange coincidence 

But if it is connected, it was a democrat false flag hoax

But if they have a long track record of GOP or MAGA support, it‚Äôs fake and they‚Äôre just transgender like the Colorado shooter

Did I do it right?"
Fomentor,"‚ÄúOn the surface, that is one of the things that, as a law enforcement agency, we are looking at and is a concern to us,‚Äù Chief Medina said.  Please, chief, dial down the strong language. He‚Äôs probably more concerned that people missed."
DawgPound919,"Historians have called the years and decades in Europe leading up to WW1 a powder keg, a powder keg of gunpowder primed to explode.  If I remember correctly, they also called the years just before our Civil War the dame thing. Harper's Ferry, Bloody Kansas, etc are initial skirmishes that eventually led to war. I see this now in the United States. In the shadow of the 2nd anniversary of January 6, I believe the right wing zealots are just an ignition away from starting severe hostilities. Will this be a geographic war, I doubt it, our society is so intermixed regionally now that it won't be a north vs. south. I feel the far extremist right has declared war on the US way of life. The freedom caucus in the House is the political wing of these groups. They are nihilistic anti-government anarchist who want to watch the forest burn. 

I am afraid for the next 5 - 10 years in the United States."
