FKaanK,"That seemed fun, so i guess they were telling the truth?"
ActionBlyat,"That totally seems fun, i usually get a flechette enema from a shotgun barrel shoved up my ass by elbow camper."
tuck_fravis,"Damn near shat my pants. Killed 7 PMCs in total, 2 as I entered dorms 4 in the clip and 1 as I was leaving dorms. Forgot to screenshot the post extract screen."
tryin_to_make_u_mad,Holy shit you actually get in gunfights? I have yet to have a fight thst involved the enemy using more than one bullet. No fuckin clue what to do at this point

kamparox,Anyone else feel like this wipe has more squads than any other before? Maybe it's the server merging or something but wow. It's rough out there for solos.

Blob5s,Nice job! Looked intense.
Jack_ten,They actually look like paid actors
Jaketylerholt,One of the rare times when you're super glad that you didnt run a suppressor. Wouldve been pushing your gun down while you were working the door. Good clip.
cloud715,Nobody says dorms is fun
Spiff_GN,Literally all they had to do was wait lmao. Why would they walk in 1 by 1... nice shooting tho.

mrbawkbegawks,bind 4 to on push to do your heavy bleeds then bind #5 to button 4 on release so you can heal after you stop the bleed and save time

Indianajones1989,I hope no other game in history every adopots this games healing mechanics. Its not fun spending 5 fucking minutes healing after every damn fight. Especially bec as soon as you're done healing you get rushed again and one burst blacks fours limbs.
