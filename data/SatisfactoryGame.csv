It could probably be worse...,,10vejd3,5466,201,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/10vejd3/it_could_probably_be_worse/,sciguyCO,"I honestly believe this is deliberate in the game design.  All the starting locations (at least if you don't stray too far from your spawn point) are likely going to need 1km or more to travel to coal.  Maybe with some cliffs in the way.  The game is trying to ""nudge"" you to expand to new areas.

Since you said you're in the rocky desert (my own preferred starting zone), that ping is likely one of two:

* East of the rocky desert, at the top of the cliffs up in the ""crater lake"" biome.  You could do what I did my first playthrough: build a massive ramp of foundation up the cliff face to get to the nodes.  Or you can notice that there's a bit of a ""road"" leading up the cliffside (south of the that little inland lake) and go up that way.  There is some poison gas to dodge, but you can get around pretty easy.  Three pure coal nodes, a decent amount of flat space and convenient nearby water makes this a nice location for generators.
* In the northern part of the rocky desert where it meets up with the forest, spire coast, and canyon.  This is a bit easier to get to (follow the river), and has the additional benefit of quite a few useful resources: pure nodes of iron, copper, quartz and caterium isn't too far.  A pretty good spot for an initial steel production."

Inflation is when a company that has to buy product is spending more on that product, now they're charging more.  But Factorio isn't spending more Factorio.  It's already out there, they're not developing it.

Yes inflammation is a thing, increasing price to compensate it, is just a logical step.

Factorio and Satisfactory have an entirely different audience. The audience if Satisfactory is much bigger I think. But also much more likely to get fished by discounts n stuff, what Factorio never did. They just announced an price the game was worth. And when ever they made big additions to the game, they increased the piece, since the product got better and more worth. Totaly legit. 

Making a post and what I assume, is spreading hate over wube for compensation of inflation, is just not right"

It's a hyper-capitalist future where:  


\- The over-industrialization on Earth as seen in *Shipbreaker* has led to all of the pioneering and exploring of the frontier of space seen in the other games.  


\- ""Storage Dimensions"" and handheld rapid construction technology seems commonplace and exists across different designs and ""brands""  


\- ""Why would I waste money on building robots to do this when I can hire some *random jobber* to do it?"" - every company in existence

\- *Shipbreaker's* in-universe explained respawn system via cloning (and tying it to debt slavery to a company) absolutely applies to FicSit

\- There are clearly signs of other alien life out there, be it animals or sentients

\- *Satisfactory's* AI Limiter parts are intended to prevent the exact ""AI God"" situation that you see signs of in *Shipbreaker's* Ghost Ships

\- Corporate lobbying to erode worker's rights into being a hilarious pipe dream and companies treating employees like ""property"" as explained in *Shipbreaker* are referenced in both *Subnautica* and *Satisfactory*

In these 'universes' Humanity is gone.  Humans are extinct.  Everything and everyone is AI/Robot/Clone.  That's all that remains of our once great society.

______

The AIs in charge are attempting to recreate our society.  It's why society in every one of these 'universes' seems like a parody or mockery of Humanity; because it is.

Since there are no humans remaining, all that the AIs/Robots/Clones have to inform them of our society are the remnants of what was.  The expansionist dogma is just the new ChatGPT-AI-Overlord spewing out its interpretation of us.

Maybe Ficsit was trying to exploit Fortuna but lost to the other companies. Due to Korolev's rather aggressive weapons and behaviour, they probably shot down Ficsit lol.

And what variety there is mostly comes down to the same ships with different colors or seat arrangement. C.) You're in space, why the fuck is there air drag!? Like wtf I don't care if I could drift away if I'm not careful (that'd actually be consistent with ways they've fucked with the menus to make it more cumbersome), it's maddening to push something towards one of the bins only for it to stop dead in it's tracks about a meter away unless you just spam the throw/push button."

Some games have arbitrary play length restrictions where you can't really advance the game in under a certain amount of time.   Satisfactory has no such mechanism. So if you need to out the game down after 15 minutes you can save, exit and lose nothing.

However I'd definitely accept the argument that you can't get a lot of meaningful work done in this game in just 15 minutes.

Maybe this is less true after blueprints were added, but I feel like unless you're doing something very small, 15 minutes isn't enough time."

The trick was only playing for 10-20 minutes in the morning before work, and having a comprehensive step-by-step todo list (external to the game) with tasks broken down into small steps. Then, when logging in each morning with my coffee, I just reference the list and do as it says. Sometimes I spend a few minutes adding more tasks to the list for future days.

For example, instead of overbroad tasks like “build more furnaces”, I would break it down into 5 minute steps: “calculate number of machines for X output” > “choose suitable location for X factory” > “gather building supplies for X factory”, etc."

I haven't played since update four. When I last played, I had permaday (and some other mod on). I didn't make a ""pre-mod"" save, so all my auto saves have the mods in them. I really want to get back into the game, but starting over is so daunting.

I browse this subreddit and think how awesome it would be to have the materials to build the awesome structures you have (but ultimately implementation never looks like what it did in my head). So I log in for 15 minutes, realize I have nowhere near what I did with mods. I have mk 1 miners with a single belt and no storage and then I log off thinking of what could have been had I never enabled mods... Or had that pre-mod save. 

So intimidating playing now, especially starting over!"

Then like Matroska Dolls, make a container inside a container inside a container inside a container until you get to the smallest unit of container.

At the outer edge, put in materials to build the next tier of technology or part. Each layer in are the next set of materials. At the very core of the containers, exists star stuff or whatever the end game material is.


Then fly out of to the edge of the map to the largest container. Stand a 100 meters from it. Save. Quit.

I call it the 'Mechanicus Moment"". 

It's defined the moment where I look at the factory, and have absolutely no clue what or where shit is or how the collective factory works, only where the output is.

""Where are the Encased Steel Beams made? Not a fucking clue. Where's a container thats somehow magically refilled with ESBs? Oh right there.""

""What does that cluster of buildings do? Dunno, but it keeps the fuel tanks here filled. And if I change anything, the entire power grid instantly fails"""

I tried to build nice and with system. But he was off work earlier and just made things work. Somehow... One day when I logged in, I had 6 conveyor belts stacked on top of me. Followed up by floating platforms with even more spaghetti conveyor action.

I eventually gave up on trying to clean things up, because I felt like I did nothing else every time I logged in. When my friend couldn't play for 2 weeks, he completely forgot where he put things and lost interest.

So... yeah... Now I have a server running a factory I have no ambitions to fix anymore. My advice would be... If you want to build nicely, do it. It takes much longer, but if this is giving you the joy to play the game, it's worth it. But if you don't mind chaos, building like this is also quiet fun."

But I just finished a small section of beauty and I think we all know that the mess won't be in frame when I post pictures of the beautiful section.

So, y'know what? Don't compare yourself to the best bits of what people have accomplished. Use that messy factory to make all the parts you need to experiment and find an aesthetic that you can make your own off in a new corner of the world.

Edit: I suppose if I'm going to be honest, my initial reaction was probably too hard on myself. We're our own worst critics. At this point, I have enough hours logged that I'm kinda in the middle of the two sides. I have buildings of a sort, but generally they don't get finished before I change my mind about what I want, so they get abandoned halfway with machines churning out parts in a factory that consists of stacks of floating floors."

I started doign the minimalist thing to lower the object count on the map and speed up save times and fps. Before abandoning the idea I was once planning on expanding power production to 1100ish GW with 100k hours worth of maxed out plutonium waste production storage at the top of the world at the southern edge of the map, just below the damage boundary (60,032 connected double containers, planned 268 long, 7 high, 32 wide). I abandoned that idea after not even 20% of that was built after a few days of spamming blueprints. Ended up deleting that due to my fps dropping from 50-60 to 20ish and getting worse. I guess it was for the best as after doing the math the radiation of that much waste (1.44B barrels evenentually) would even reach the ground at the opposite edge of the map from 2150m up (no safe spot anywhere) once filled, so would have to wear a suit and keep most of my inventory filled with filters 24/7 to not die while afk overnight no matter where I was. They really need to make that realistic with an inverse square law and add mods to where objects like dirt and concrete attenuate it further as it does in the real world."

It remembers that it came from a blueprint, allowing you to delete the whole thing at any time (not just immediately after). Or do other things like middle-click to copy the blueprint, not just one object.

Then there's a new keybind to permanently ""ungroup"" a blueprint object, splitting it into it's individual components so you can edit them individually."

When deleting in blueprint mode, search the blueprint volume around the target buildable for buildables with the same object property, and highlight for deletion in the same way as multi-select.

Edit: each blueprint placed increments a global counter tracking 'blueprint serial number'. The serial number can be the blueprint id - the property value."

Blueprints also need to be saved in cloud.

Had to reset my PC today. I knew satisfactory was saving in the cloud, so didn't think twice about wiping it.

Reset PC, reinstalled Satisfactory and saw my saves - so far so good.  
Spent like 2 hours setting up a new train station for a new resource. Then back in base started building the production, opened Quick-search (N), started typing my blueprint-name => no results. Opened building-menu, switched to blueprints => the (sub-)categories are there, but not a single blueprint. Not sure if it's a bug or incomplete feature.

'F' for the over 20 hours standing in front of the blueprint designer tinkering modular and reusable blueprints.  
Closed the game the next minute.

1. It requires rare and limited resources.

3. It requires a massive initial power investment.
4. They find a way to make setting it up an even bigger chore than Nuclear already is."

I think the OP's New Build Style for 2023 is very nice. For those interested view [Changes Made In Fluxo's World - Color Scheme](https://youtu.be/LFSYLj0k0eE?t=37) (Video Bookmark - Previous Video) - Gone is the Tan / Blue color scheme from 2022, and the introduction of a Tan / Brown 3-Color Scheme for 2023. 

I often encourage others to view the OPs other Factory Showcases and for those whom missed them be sure to check out the [OPs YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CrusadeFluxo/videos).

➔ WHAT IS IN THIS VIDEO (Bookmarks):

* [Intro](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=15) - Opening comments by the OP, and initial views of this Awesome Build.

* [Main Entrance and Vehicle Parking](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=50) - The ""imperfect"" Roadway Wall Railing on the left is an interesting ""design"", and emphasizes that not everything needs to be perfect to look good.

* [HQ Train Station](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=80) - This area is used to bring in Munitions Factory needed materials and resources.

* [HQ Main Platform](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=97) - This grand open area utilizing the large water fall as a ""design element"" is a great idea. ★ *NOTE: All Waterfalls are ""placeholders"" and will change with the eventual new look of Water* [*as previewed in this Devlog*](https://youtu.be/omjFqZQV9fI?t=83) *(Video Bookmark) when it is finally released Map-wide.*

* [HQ Munitions Factory Production](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=121) - Look at Heavy Oil Residue (HOR), Black Powder, Smokeless Powder, Rifle Ammo and Nobelisk Production Lines. I loved the inclusion of Spire Coast Biome Landscape into the overall design.

* [HQ Munition Center](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=172) - The Munition Center next to where the HUB will be is a great idea. Really liked the ""Overlook Window Design"" giving a great view of the rest of the Build in this World.

* [Encased HUB and Trophy Room](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=203) - The idea of ""encasing"" the HUB in Coated Concrete is very nice and highly ""steal-able"". The Trophy's in the Trophy Room were properly placed and not dropped as an ""item"".

* [Outro and Final Beauty Fly-Thru's](https://youtu.be/d6-ViEUP1-M?t=237) - Final comments by the OP and some more lovely shots of this fantastic Build.

★ This Post is worthy of my Upvote and Award.

*EDIT: Corrected Trophy Room comment to reflect comment by OP.*

Now, so far i have only seen standart hogs and like 3 standart spitters. I didnt know spiders were a thing.

So i went in, expecting some hogs or spitters, but it was clear. And then sudenly that thing spawned right next to me with 3 normal size spiders ass a back up.

I had the same panic attack, only with rebar gun instead of building gun and sprinted outside the cave as fast as i could. That thing followed me, so i killed it outside, but man, with headphones on, playing in the dark during the night and without any knowledge that spiders were a thing in a game, let alone that thing, my heart rate was throuht the roof.

I still get elevated heart rate when i see one now and goosebumps, when i hear another fking artifact."

(i.e. you have a key pressed when you open a menu, the game treats it as if that key stays pressed until you press it again after exiting the menu.)

It is frankly a bit nuts that a game like this - which requires a ton of clicks - still has this issue. I've actually never played a game - EA or otherwise - that didn't handle the simple concept of ending a keypress when a menu is opened. Imo this bug is an example of a slightly broken quality process. Because no, it's not gamebreaking, but it's incredibly annoying for users and should have been fixed a long, long time ago. Getting the basic UI interactions polished should be one of the first things a dev team does. Because content is amazing, but it's a real detractor from the game if the way you interact with that content has bugs like this.

Oh, another idea - the ctrl + mouse4 method of deleting identical objects should be expanded so it deletes anything in a similar category (e.g. any object you can switch to via the E quick switch from the selected object should be eligible for deletion). Like who has really ever wanted to go around deleting specifically mk4 conveyors but not mk5? The use case is normally ""I want to delete every conveyor"" or ""I want to delete every conveyor lift"", not ""I want to delete every conveyor *of this specific level*"".

In line with that idea, a ""delete everything except foundations/walls"" feature would be very useful, because generally that's the primary use case for mass deletion of specific kinds of objects - you want to delete a bunch of stuff in the factory, but not the structure itself. And the funny thing is that the devs clearly know this, because the blueprint designer has this exact functionality built in by default - if you start the deletion selection on an object in the designer, it will not delete the designer even if you accidentally select it."

I'd like an option to earn recipes as well maybe through the points system, or maybe the alien artefacts or something - while the randomised recipes from HDs is interesting, things like diluted fuel are quite key in the later stages of the game to get sufficient plastic and I never got to that one, despite hunting HDs for hours. Perhaps a recipe tree might work so you could focus all your research in a specific area?

Belt throughputs would also be really key - maybe like with the power pole capacity screen or similar.

Going around to CTRL+C/CTRL+V production settings is fine when you have just 1-2 machines, but it turns into a real PITA when you need to change the settings for a large factory (either initial input, or altering the through-put after an upgrade to the supplying miner). I'd like to see:

1. a ""second wire"" added to every automated production machine; separate hookup 
2. A new ""data wire"" added (I'm thinking something you unlock, either directly or indirectly, in tier 6)
3. A ""production computer"" unlocked along side the ""data wire"" (with an in-game model similar to that of the power switch).

Run the data wires the same way you power wires, but on separate poles, terminating at the production computer. From there, every machine can have their production type & rate adjusted together - and you can no longer make adjusts at the machine. I would say no adjusting individual machines from the computer either, but you can see how many shards are installed in which machines. Something like this would be great when you have 24 machines that all need to dry exactly the same, but would be way overkill when you're just running a few machines. It would also be great for large factories, since you could put the computers all right next to one another, and adjust all the settings in your factory in just a couple of minutes, leaving more time for building & decorating."

They should integrate that feature into the game ASAP.

I created a ""plugs & lights everywhere"" ceiling blueprint. Works well, but placing that first blueprint is royal pain in the butt (once one is put down, it's easy to tile the rest). Creating some mechanism to select the snap point of a given blueprint needs to be added (to be fair, in Coffee Stain's state-of-the-game videos, they've noted that this needs to be added). Also with this blueprint, it is hellaciously difficult to figure out its orientation, to the point that I leave off one ceiling foundation so as to be able to determine its orientation. Putting a template on the foundations to identify a corner doesn't work (the template isn't shown until the blueprint is placed and everything filled in). Allowing one to see a template of a blueprint would be nice, too.

I want to be able to utilize every node on the map. But I'm also terrified of my UPS dropping to single digits because I'm making hundreds and hundreds of refineries, constructors, etc.

One option is every building can be overclocked without the use of a power shard, and power shards instead would offset the energy inefficiency of it. Power generators would be fuel inefficient during overclocking, correcting back to normal levels via a power shard.

Either that or XXL versions of production buildings that requrie rare resources like power shards, or mercer spheres to build. For example a massive refinery with ten times the throughput of a regular refinery with many piping and belt inputs. Same thing with a constructor or fuel generator, etc. These buildings themselves should be able to be overclocked.

Not only will it save on object count, but it will also introduce the need to create new types of manifold designs to accommodate the inputs and outputs, which will spice up the game. Imagine how cool it would be to connect 10 belts or pipes of the same resource into or out from a building-- and making it look good.

Being able to have basic conditional statements would be a huge boost. For instance, power junction activates when grid B drops below x GW, or merger allows left input if output isn't saturated, or splitter forbids left output if container has >x items, or train skips stop if freight loading station has <x items.

Factorio's circuit network was one of the strongest points of the game and I'd love to see that sort of mechanic come to Satisfactory. It would really level up the automation. 

Similarly, remote control of grids. Look at a console to see the status of each grid, and toggle junctions without physically walking over to them.

• Tree Regrowth - Make it so we can manage the forestry just as if it were a resource like everything else. This would make biofuel more manageable, but also trickier logistically. You could have automated tree farms at a later tier, and make the yields higher by waiting for the larger and denser growth. Also, let's be honest: a naked world without is just ugly. Imagine if you could go back and correct the ecological mistakes you made without thinking in the start of the game!

• CO2 Buildup - Right now, you can just pump the exhaust from all of your factories into the atmosphere and not worry about it. What if it had drastic effects? Sea level rise or loss for instance, or even plants growing back (see last entry) at a slower rate? Think about the gasses as a resource that needs to be managed, similar to how spent nuclear fuel needs to be. It could be injected back into the regolith (expended SAM Ore sites?), extracted and turned into carbon dust to be sunk or used to create steel, etc. The CO2 can build up progressively over time, making it a late game 'resource' that needs to be worked out/solved.

• Water Quality/Desalination - This is already a feature when it comes to geysers, but imagine that you had to construct desalination plants to use the ocean water. This would have the effect of having an abundance of water available later in the game, but also makes logistics more difficult early game and the placement of coal powerplants integral to keeping everything going smoothly. You could also take this one step further and add geysers that require purification before use, or sitting water needs to be purified before being sucked into a coal powerplant.

Just some thoughts! I know there has been talk about not adding flying machines, which I understand for the term of game balance. What do you guys think of my ideas? Anything that seems to gradious or difficult to implement for the developers?

2) vehicle improvements, ability to move/update without having to re-record a path.  
3) Blueprints, build and design without materials.  Ability to modify without destroy.  Would rather this be a dedicated immersion vs. an in world builder.  Drag and drop approach.  
4) roads material, curved edges, like train tracks but less restrictions on curvature
5) hybrid splitter/merger.  2 in 2 out, smart preferred.  Would love to see a verticle option, too
6) ability to move after initial placement.  Multiselect option with move using current edge notify system."

Examples of use:

When your fuel generators run out of fuel (at a certain set threshold) it will kick on your coal backup generators.

When you're transporting more than one item on a single tractor/truck/freight cargo, and you want to keep one item in its storage, you can lock a conveyor for a set period, and turn it back on. (Building a smart splitter and storage container, feeding back into the truck station)

When you have a coal generator system hooked up to a power switch, and a fuel generator system on another one, they won't transfer power unless both are on (pretty niche, but a possible use for AND gates.)

The combination of really long autosave times - my autosave takes at least a minute each time on an SSD - and relatively frequent crashes (my game crashes once a day on average) is a really, really not-fun experience.

Don't get me wrong, the game is amazing. But we're years into EA now. At some point, EA stops being a good reason for all the bugs. There's *never* going to be a time when the universe drops a nice big free block of time on the devs for them to just dedicate to bugfixing. That's a pipe dream, it's never going to happen. There are always going to be other priorities, other content to release, etc. - so the devs need to figure out a way to make quality a part of their ongoing process. The whole ""oh we're going to fix all the bugs for 1.0 while we introduce new bugs in every content patch before then"" - that's just a fantasy.

Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing game. I don't want to sound too negative in the above comment. But at some point the devs need to make an active choice to stop accepting so much bugginess in their product, and that choice can't wait for 1.0."

Elevator and vehicle elevators like linear motion mod, just want a vanilla version of that. hypertubes are alright but they look a little out of place in an industrial looking factory.

MK6 belts for the 1200 output of the overclocked MK3 miner. It also will fit with having 6 belts total with 3 being cheap options (mk1, mk3 and mk5) and expensive options (mk2, mk4 and mk6) make us work for that mk6!

Perhaps some more gasses or fluid types would be cool as there aren't all that many truthfully. I've been playing a mod while waiting for update 8 and it's pretty interesting having to work with so many fluids and gasses (SatisfactoryPlus mod for any curious).

Same with environmental dangers; the poison clouds are used way too much. 

A better fighting system. Iuno, add more weapon types and specializations, blocking or dodging, enemy weakness', or something. The combat when exploring is boring and easy; creatures don't have many moves and different types of the same specie will have the same move set (like different spitters having almost identical attacks). You go through 10 different biomes and fight the exact same way. 

The exploration is the big let down for me. I want to find the alternate recipes and the slugs to keep improving my factories, but I don't have fun walking long distances on the map. It all feels redundant and missing things. The biomes look a bit different, but don't actually have much different in terms of resources (on top of creatures being the same), so you never get this sense that you have discovered something very different and are about to progress in the game with exploration. Height obstacles are easily cleared by spamming foundations. None of it feels like a fun, rewarding challenge; it feels like a chore.

As for quality of life stuff : A bigger blueprint pad, an undo for last build action, better inventory management (ex : mass deleting multiple selected stacks at once), the ability for belts and pipes from blueprints to connect, fixing bugs."

Leuf (pronounced \[l ɔɪ̯ f\]) is a word that is derived from ""Läufer"" which translates to ""runner"" or ""someone who's job is running"". It is also used in context of deliveries. ""Der Pizzaläufer"" would be ""the person who runs with a pizza"". Therefor the stem of the word is also used in other delivery options. Such as this fuel canister. For differentiation between people and objects the ""äu"" is replaced with ""eu"" though that does not change the pronounciation. And then you've arrived at ""Leuf"" referring to an object that transports/delivers other stuff."

Most of the outposts create ingots using the 'efficient' recipes where water is added and trains carry it around the map. power usage is about 150,000MW.

They pause as they hear a scuttling sound. From behind them a large spider-like creature emerges. Arthur quickly impales the creature but a dozen more emerge from all around. The pair flees deeper into the tunnels but the creatures are gaining on them. Then they hear a soft ""thump"" followed by a deafening explosion. The creatures had all been killed. A stout figure with an enormous beard emerges from a darkened passage. He raises a pickaxe above his head and shouts at Prince Arthur ""ROCK AND STONE"".

And I’m far too lazy to do a full circle line or build them too much because:


1: I hate it when structures float(First rule of Minecraft is don’t leave trees floating.) 


2: because of subject #1, I feel the need to make a realistically supported bridge, so therefore, bridge support towers.


3:I build bridges because rail building is wonky as fuck and building in a straight line up, down, or flat is better than snaking on the ground.


4: It took me 50 hours to do the first bridge, 
granted that was my first time, and I was traveling from The Dunes to the Grassy Plateaus. My nuclear waste line took 40 hours to make, it went from Swamp ocean to Tall red trees to the the top left corner of the map. 


5: Bridge 1 took approximately 5 industrial storage crates of each concrete and plates to make. Bridge 2 took 7 industrial storage crates. 


6: For my project parts 4 base, most of my resources came from conveyor belts. (mk5 of course). For 8 turbo motors per min(quite proud of that for first play-through) it took me 36 hours to set up all the conveyor lines for the ore. And in total, about 40 hours on the project. 


7:I’d rather not spend 40 hours on a bridge, 
when I’d rather use that time to make a actually good factory. 


8: as for trucks, trains are superior.


9:as for drones, they are awesome, but I’m not making a battery factory for every single region on the map I have a big base on. (That being 6 with 25 satellite bases). 


9: And that’s why Conveyor belts are the superior mode of transport. 


10: conveyor belts are ugly as fuck and that’s points off. It’s way cleaner with vehicles.

Edit bonus:
The longest track I’ve made in a straight line is 1,900 meters. Northern most quartz node all the way to the red forest."

I don't put vehicles in play until it's over 1km.  And even then it has to be a run that I'm certain will be worth the hassle.  Otherwise setting up conveyors is just plain better. 

Where trains really pay off is when you have either a high quantity or high diversity of items that need to be shipped around the map to different bases.  Then you can really benefit from setting up a track one time and just adding cars and trains for all the different stuff you need to move around."

Since we're posting poles.,,10v2tpz,951,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/10v2tpz/since_were_posting_poles/,LazarusOwenhart,"So here's how this works. The Red side brings up to 6 feeds back to my main control room from power plants around the map. These feeds are isolated lines and never touch each other. My power plants are 100% isolated from the grid until they hit the control room.

The Green side takes power from the control room to individual substations around the map, again they never intersect.

The Hypertube system on these poles is powered by a totally separate, self sustaining, completely isolated fuel powered grid with an extremely large battery bank.

My switch room has isolators for each power plant which feeds into a single bus bar linking them all together which then feeds to individual output lines per substation. What this means is that for late game power failures I can: 1 Travel back to the hub because the Hypertube system is entirely self sustaining and should run forever even with a total grid failure. 2 Disconnect all my power plants from the grid and shutdown all substation feeds. 3 Turn my Black Start main fuel power plant back on, it's gravity primed, self sustaining when isolated and stocks excess fuel so self primes on shutdown in the event of a grid failure. Once that power plant is online and running at capacity I can use it to prime and restart each other power station individually. Once all power is back online I can throw over my main grid isolator and individually bring sectors of my grid back online whilst leaving the problematic area isolated until I've solved the problem or increased power capacity to compensate.

A car like the one way down in the (caterium?) mam tree should be much sooner, maybe even before trucks.  

Also, the terrain is fairly vehicle unfriendly throughout most of the world.  It’s only when you finally get trains that the world really opens up, and that’s only after a LOT of time laying tracks.

Adding an intermediate step like this before trains but when you want to explore could be nice, but this game just has too much verticality for most vehicles to really feel useful.  That’s why trains shine, you can create your own slopes or just fly above the ground wherever."

But by the time you would unlock it you would no longer have any need for it. Perhaps it could replace the explorer. Or be an explorer upgrade that you unlock alongside the truck. However, I personally agree with other comments below. I'd much prefer a smaller vehicle. Perhaps a drone. That could follow you and act as extra storage. Something that you can send back to your base to load or unload maternials. That wuld be so helpful with building new factories. 

Personally the blueprint scanner and explorer does almost everything I'd like from this thing. I'd like the explorer to be a little more stable on rough terrain, and have a larger cargo hold. But it has more than enough, and with the blueprint scanner I can easily plop down a starter facroty wherever I need it. Two or three biofuel burners is really all you need to start a factory. 

Fine a nearby water source and some coal or oil and hook up some biofuel burners to get the machines started then let them power everything else as you scale up from there.   


If need be I have a blueprint capable of prodicung iron rods, plates, and reinforced plated from just one biofuel burner. I just hook that up and let it run, that gives me everything I need to start building my power source.  I need fewer than 10 inventory slots to start a new factory. After it gets established just refill and repeat. 

That being said If I could send a drone back and forth to my base, to resupply me with materials occasionally I oculd just plop down a factory and move to the next node. Easy peasy."

The best I can give is. get a basic factory running that allows you to create parts for Refineries. Then hunt down hard discs to open all refinery alt recipes. 

Find new nodes, all pure(VIMP!) and make a huge foundation platform to allow space for growth. Each pure node allows 22 refineries(for iron ingots) and outputs a wopping 1400 iron ingots per min. This will allow you to max out all outputs.

so in the end... TOP TIP use refineries in a large space area

I always suggest stsrting with a target production goal.  Its easy to just say ""I want 10 fuel rods per minute, what inputs do I need for that"".

Then you figure out what inputs THOSE inputs need, until you're all the way down to raw resources.

I always recommend using raw resources for nuclear.  Make everything from scratch and don't share production lines with the rest of your world.   That's begging for a problem when you some day overtap a resource not realizing you're starving some part of your nuclear infrastructure."

i was chilling in the game when a GIANT spider randomly jumped in front of me, that was TERRIFYING (i'm highly arachnophobic, because of little traumas involving spiders that appened when i was little).  
finally i can access caves without the fear of having little/big spiders jumpscaring me, wich is very very good for me.  
however, i think it need a little ''rework'' because sometimes i can see very little parts of the spiders texture, wich still makes me scare my soul.  
another little problem is that, when i kill a spider and take his loot, you can still look at its white outlines, and yes, it scares me.  
i am probably being very critic talking about this filter, but dont understand me wrong, i still LOVE the arachophobia mode because i can play the game without so much fear of random spiders coming, it just need some reworks for people who are very very very scared of spiders, like me and other people.

thanks everyone for the 600 upvotes!, sorry for my non fluent english writing, i'm still working on it."

Although mine was a giant early steel plant and forgot to see how much power it needed. Turns out if your pretty new factory needs \~1700 MW and you only have 1200 total production (that you're also using a good chunk of) it won't run. So I go and set up some more coal power to bring me up to 3600 MW. Didn't have enough stuff on me to jump start it. So I go all the way back to my starting factory where I had 14 empty Biomass Burners on a shelf. And then I added 46 more so it's now a shelf with 60 Burners on it and used that to jump start the entire grid."

So this may not apply to you if your oil factory isn't creating any fuel to burn.  My solution was a staged startup:

1. Set 3/4 of the production machines to standby.  That kept me within my existing power production.
2. Plug in the remaining refineries / blenders.  The turbofuel output line then was split between:
   1. My ""phase 1"" bank of fuel generators.  
   2. Industrial storage tanks.  This had a priority junction so they only get filled once the phase 1 generators are saturated with turbofuel.
   3. A pipe to primary bank of generators, but with a closed valve (to reduce chance of stuttering).
3. Once that first bank of generators came online, they made enough power to activate the rest of the fuel production.
4. Let it run enough to build up backup reserve in the tanks.  Then open the valve out to the primary generator array.

That also caused me to decide ""why not do a control room for the facility"".  I setup an ""emergency reboot"" procedure laid out in signs.  Some power switches and valves let me disconnect from the main world grid, close off fuel going to primary bank, open valve to send fuel reserves to phase 1, use that bank's power to restart fuel production, then bring primary bank of generators back online and reconnect to main grid."

"Freight Platform crane is designed to handle 20.000kg load, but a fully loaded Fluid car is 70.000kg and fully loaded solid car can get up to 98.000kg",,10finz9,766,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/10finz9/freight_platform_crane_is_designed_to_handle/,Ralph_hh,"I imagine they built that crane on earth, capable of carrying a mass of 20tons - weight of approx. 200,000 Newton. Assuming that Massage Asteroid is quite small, gravity is also quite small, so the weight of a waggon containing the mass of 1,400tons of concrete is maybe small enough to be lifted.

Some maths: This means gravity must be less than 1/70th on that asteroid. Gravity correlates to the asteroids / planets mass which is dictated mostly by volume (Assuming it consists of the same material - Silicon oxides, Magnesium oxides, Iron). The diameter goes in that with V=(4/3 pi r\^3), so the asteroids diameter must be approximately 1/4 of that of our planet earth.

While this is absolutely plausible, that 1/70th of gravity would make jumoing pretty easy, you woud be able to jump up cliffs, you may not need these boots and you accelerate downwards so slowly that you should be able to jump down from just anywhere unharmed.

\-->So either that crane is labelled wrong or the effect of physics on the player is poorly done."

It uses the Sloppy Alumina -> Electrode Aluminium Scrap -> Pure Aluminium Ingot recipes and recycles all its waste water. The recycling is stable and self restarting through the use of a throttled valve on the fresh water pipe and the elevation difference between the the scrap and alumina refineries (right side of first picture), giving priority to the waste water. The aluminium is used to create fused modular frames for nuclear pasta, radio control units for turbo motors and heat sinks for the plutonium recycling of the nearby 180GW nuclear power plant."

2: Am I having fun?

Bonus question: Am I an agent of chaos? If the answer to this is ""yes,"" there is automatically no wrong way to play."
Am I doing this right?,,10z94y4,631,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/10z94y4/am_i_doing_this_right/,bremidon,"Are you doing it right?  Let me answer you by telling you my story.

I've got over 500 hours in the game.  I (sort of) recently started over, just so I could try out a new starting spot and see how that changes what I eventually come up with.  Plus, I had too many spots I wanted to completely rework, and I thought that restarting would be a bit easier.

Guess what my base looked like for the first 50 hours after restarting?  We are spaghetti brothers-in-arms.  Got room over there?  Then it's time to fill it.  Get the belts through, however it must be.  Going vertical merely meant adding new layers of spaghetti.  It'll be fine...

Granted, I did not have this much clipping, because that hurts the noggin', but other than that, it was barely contained chaos until coal.  At which point, it became not-quite-contained chaos.  

I pressed on.

I decided to clean everything up right before aluminum, and I'm still refactoring.  I kinda got stuck working on my main train station which is huge.  I wanted to try out the blueprints, and while it took forever to get the prints like I wanted them, now the station comes together much faster than my concrete production can handle.  It's actually quite nice, with columns, the trains all moving below the platform and only coming up at the platform, and some nice blueprinted cargo movers.  I should note that my computer has started to whine a little bit when I look at it.  It'll just have to toughen up.

But I don't have enough concrete now.  So guess what my next mini-project is?  Meanwhile, I have aluminum ingots ready to go (also blueprinted to fit in a single 4x4 blueprint), and I'm just waiting for my trains to be finished so I can start shipping copper ingots over there and bring back the sheets.

I also had to take a break to go hard drive hunting.  I've got currently everything that I can have.  Also have pretty much all the functional stuff that tickets can buy.  Now I just need all the statues.  All of them.  I already have their places ready.  

Oh, and I had to take a small break to do the Fichsmas stuff.  Fortunately I was kinda ready for it and had already started the clean-up (Did I mention that I have been doing the refactoring since right before the Fichsmas started?)  But it must be done.  I need those snowballs and rockets.  I now have a warehouse full of snowballs and rockets.  The wildlife is less enthused about the snowballs, especially the Johnny twins I dispatched recently.  Two new jetpacks for me!

But it's starting to wind slowly back to the aluminum.  Just some more concrete, a few more blueprints for the train lines themselves, and then it's time for the next big push towards nuclear.  

So are you doing it right?  Hell if I know.  I don't have a clue what the difference between right and wrong is anymore; not since I started luring hogs over cliffs so I could get a yellow slug.  I fear for the doggos.  

But if you are having as much fun as I am, than I guess you are doing it right after all."

As you've already figured out, you can still drop a miner on these nodes and they will function normally.  Map coordinates were taken from the SCIM Interactive Map, btw.

You need to be able to load balance to make sure you don’t have backups preventing your machines from working. Simple manifolds won’t work because your early machines will get clogged and your latter machines won’t get what they need. Eventually you start producing inefficiently or your water inputs get filled and you need to drain the system. This game is all about efficiency and sometimes manifolds don’t cut it."

That will lead to a higher output at the other 2 belts on left splitter. Left side will have the same amount at 2 belts than right side at 3 belts. This can only work if belts are a lot faster than resource node ore if belt from merger to first splitter is one mk higher that the items will divided very fast. I balance only at exits. If I need full capacity i will insert a large storage. So i have 2 exits with full capacity again. And I can input them with full capacity with 2 belts if needed. This splitting / merging thing can be very messy if you don’t have the numbers in mind how much items you need at the end of belt.

What does aggravate me to no end is what they did with snapping.  I don't encounter it every time, but often enough.  

What the issue is happens when belting up splitters, mergers, to machines, etc.  Everything is facing and aligned correctly, yet the belt goes yellow and is all over the place but where it needs to go, with a red outline as if it is facing incorrectly.  This was never an issue in update 5 or below.

You can smooth it out with batteries but its effectively free power.

Your max consumption is over your production still.

A few thhings like concrete and alclad sheets are 5 factories extra each, 480? Concrete and 150 sheets. My next two steps in the save are: using ALL 2100 uranium in the world for a 252 nuclear reactor setup, then making all that 1150+ waste/min into like 13 plutonium fuel rods and sinking them. A completely waste free nuclear setup using every uranium node. This generates about +560GW of power (630GW- the factory itself). The other option was balance out the uranium to plutonium ratio into like 1100GW (1.100.000MW) of reactors but then I’d need to deal with plutonium waste, and AFAIK 600GW is plenty to run the entire world into phase 4 parts into sinks. Step two is making 2-2-8-8 of the elevator parts themselves, that is like 30GW on it’s own though so idk whether to build some extra turbofuel, setup the elevator parts and THEN do the 252 nuclear power plants or setup nuclear first and literally never worry about power again.

Edit: the main reason I opted to sink the rods is because getting double the power output (which I might never even use) would cost a lot more resources to get the rods from like 12/min to 30/min effectively sucking up triple the amount of nodes"
