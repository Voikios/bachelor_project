StructureOk8023,"Diluted fuel has been a blessing for me.
I really recommend it wherever its possible/necessary as it easily allowed me to avoid nuclear in its entirety all the way to the end.
It just takes a lot of space.

When it came to endgame productions I basically bit the bullet and mass produced every individual component.
Nothing the game throws at me could ever beat 100+ radio units, computers, crystal oscilators and other big components now!"
mTz84,"I've put more accelerators than needed for pasta and let them run at a lower speed.  
Making 0.3 (instead of 0.5) per machine cuts the top power consumption to \~780MW instead of 1500MW.

Also, you can let your accelerators start in sequence instead of all at once.  
Currently I have 8 for pasta and when the first machine is at 12.5%, the next is at 25%, then 37.5%... and so on.

This means if one machine is at top power consumption, another is at its lowest point and you never reach the sum of top consumption that shows in the power overview, giving you more ""buffer"" on your power setup and reducing the risk of power outage."
Svenderman,"Yeah I might have messed up.  Never looked into the Nuclear pasta creations. 

So I have them full with slugs and now realize that was a MAJOR mistake thanks to mTz84.  I wanted a nice production of pasta, but have been struggling to find ways to make more power"
Verloc5150,I’m working on mag field generators and assembly directors right now. ADS’s will probably about max out the current grid so I’ll be taking a break after ADS is online to go carpet the oil coast with a diluted fuel setup.
dontfuckclowns,"I can't even count how many times I've had to just load back to an hour earlier save, because it would take less time than to jumpstart my factory after I've lost power"
Metroidman97,"I haven't even finished phase 3 yet, but once I reach phase 4, I'm gonna do my damndest to avoid setting up nuclear power until I can convert uranium waste into plutonium, so I can have a waste free nuclear setup."
raknor88,Only 200 hours? Are you trung for a speed run? That seems really fast to reach that tier.
