Tobiassaururs,I got factorio back in the day for 12 or 14€ ...
Loot1278,"I paid 30 genuine canadian pesos one time, about 2700 hours ago. still not sure if factorio was worth it yet or not."
librarian-faust,"Factorio has a policy that they will never have a discount.

Think that's fair.

Satisfactory putting a discount on at the same time as Factorio's inflation adjustment is both hilarious and good business."
EightBitRanger,"Factorio at $30 and 591.9h works out to $0.05 per hour.
At $35, that's $0.06 per hour."
WinterMajor6088,"No matter the amount you pay for Factorio, it'll still be a great game and worth sinking all your time into."
FS_NeZ,"It's Factorio. 97% positive reviews.

Quality comes with a price."
C0oky,"I just love that the Satisfactory Twitter account answered »MAKE IT $40« with the ""shut up and take my money"" meme 

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/SatisfactoryAF/status/1616396770648391682)"
ghostkenobi,"I know this is not a mean spirited post because Satisfactory and Factorio players are usually pretty nice and wholesome, but I’ve never been able to wrap my head around the constant comparison/competition between these two game fan bases. 

The only real overlap between these two games is the concept of automation, conveyer belts and having a play on the word “factory” in their name.  It would be like comparing DRG to Call of Duty Zombies just because they are both FPS horde survival."
trollsong,Making more copies of a digital game must be expensive.
Narruin,"If I buy it, it triggers free Factorio on Epic store for everyone"
semicorne,But factorio was good from the start tho
critically_damped,Factorio basically doubles its content every three months.  The Space exploration mod in particular is so ridiculously expansive that nothing in ANY other factory game comes even close.  And until there are genuinely functional circuit networks in Satisfactory I don't think I'm ever going to be satisfied by it again.
zenmatrix83,"Your comparing a game by coffee stain, some one who has multiple games themselves and I believe publishes more for other developers to wube which I’m pretty sure only does 1 game. 

They aren’t trying to raise it for no reason, the game has been 30 since 2018. I don’t know about you everything around me including my rent has gone up. So they had a choice keep the game at what they consider the lowest price point to keep the lights on or risk closing the doors but doing sales they never have done. 

Gamers are some of the cheapest people in the world, I say if you haven’t played the game yet it’s your own fault"
Snoberry,Inflation between Factorio's release date and December 2022 was $30 -> $37 - it's probably worse now. $35 is still a steal.
terjerox,"I do respect factorio dev's ""no sales"" policy. They know how much their game is worth and they deserve every cent. For the kind of person who enjoys these games, factorio is worth more than any triple A title."
Mastermaze,"I bought Factorio before it was on steam for about $28 CAD iirc. I gladly bought it again at the $30 price on the Switch when that came out in the fall, and will gladly pay for the expansion they are currently working on when it comes out. Factorio is worth AAA prices imo, and Satisfactory is well on its way to get there as well once 1.0 is all polished and released"
Addfwyn,"Factorio is a good game with a long shelf life thanks to the modding community, but I can't say I have seen a case of a game that old getting a price *increase*.  Unless it is a physical-only game with limited availability.    


Can anyone think of any precedent for older games to increase price to adjust for inflation?"
Damncat403,"Factorio has levels of depth and polish satisfactory can only dream of. It can also run on a potato. 

I'm not here to say Factorio is better and satisfactory sucks. I'm here to say they're both great and you should have them both."
EightBitRanger,Yeah really. So many people throwing a tantrum over a five dollar increase when you're going to easily get your moneys worth regardless.
InsomniaticWanderer,"Factorio is a good game, but there is no solid justification for the price increase. 

It's seven years old. ""Inflation"" is a bullshit excuse."
teufler80,"Still a great game.  
Still worth the price."
sqreewy1337,Me who got it for free because my uncle made the music in game
RedHotGiblets,Never played Factorio but I picked up Satisfactory on a whim having never heard of it. I really enjoyed it! Need to get back into it again.
RollForThings,"I appreciate the meme, though CoffeeStain is pretty friendly toward Factorio's designers iirc"
dao_ofdraw,"I can't wait for the Factorio DLC. No clue what will be in it, but the Factorio devs are some of the most community conscious devs out there. When they say they want the DLC to be game changing, I wonder just far that ambition will take them."
Dalearnhardtseatbelt,"""Your contract legally compels you to harvest this artifact."""
AAKurtz,"To be fair, Factorio is a more complete game."
AcousticAtlas,Factorio slander is pointless. The game is a flawless factory builder and worth every penny.
Thranx,I have NO beef with factorio raising their price to account for inflation... also no beef with no sale.  More games should do that.  A solid demo along with a no sale policy needs to be more prevalent.
Kaneshadow,"That's fuckin lame man.  You made one of the greatest games of the modern era, a literal sensation and a genre starter... It's time to start on the next thing, it's not inflation it's that everyone on earth who was going to buy your game has bought it"
plenebo,I love how so many industries (not saying this is the case here) use inflation to justify gouging well above inflationary levels
SaugaDabs,Factorio seems cool enough but after playing satisfactory there’s absolutely no way i would buy factorio
Hugo_toxic,That's cherry picking
Ultimate_905,My personal opinion/hot take. I do not believe old video games should rise in price with inflation
TheChaseLemon,I’m sorry but a price increase on a 6 year old game. No thanks.
thealphawolf449,If they permanently lowered the price by 50% it would likely result in more profit.
Mr_Fondue,"Well, one dev is owned by a billionaire. And it ain't Wube.

I love both games so let's all be friends."
AnApexBread,"The factorio ""inflation"" thing is baffleing.  They're essentially saying ""things cost more for us so we're going to push all that cost over to you.""  

&#x200B;

Inflation is when a company that has to buy product is spending more on that product, now they're charging more.  But Factorio isn't spending more Factorio.  It's already out there, they're not developing it. 

&#x200B;

This is just shameless greed."
aza-industries,"Factorio is an absolute masterpiece in programming.  

Satisfactory doesn't come close."
TakeshiKovacs46,"Meh, I’ve been waiting for the price to drop as it’s such an old game. Definitely won’t bother now. I really didn’t like the demo in any way, shape or form, so I’m not too bothered. Satisfactory and DSP are enough to keep me occupied. Unless anyone has any other suggestions for the genre? I’m open to input."
Brawli,Random excuses
DrAgonit3,"A $5 price adjustment for inflation and everyone is losing their marbles? Jeez. If it was a Triple AAA studio pulling this stunt I'd understand as they have ludicrous money and multiple revenue streams from different games, but Factorio is Wube Software's only current project. That teeny tiny price increase will probably just help cover increased overhead costs and won't make them suddenly vastly more profitable."
TSanBot,"Paid a solid 37 BRL back in 2016 for it. If I convert to USD with the rate at that date, I paid 9.27 USD.. 

TBF, I'd pay 35 USD now too, great game... But their reasoning is BS"
Anon4711,"Dude its a 7 years old Game. Imagine today EA would rise the Price of Dishonored 2. Mega Shitstorm. 
Dont get me wrong, i like Factorio. But being OK with that Kind of bullshit raise is simpstyle."
Molwar,"This is weird that this price hike is getting so much attention, like my gaming new feed has had an article almost everyday since the announcement. At this point it's only marketed their game for free and I wouldn't be surprise they had a boost in sale because of it lol (and obviously to before the price hike)."
elephantscarter,"What’s satisfactory, some kind of Factorio clone? Does it work on steam deck?"
yerachden,"I truly don't get what this post is about.

Yes inflammation is a thing, increasing price to compensate it, is just a logical step.

Factorio and Satisfactory have an entirely different audience. The audience if Satisfactory is much bigger I think. But also much more likely to get fished by discounts n stuff, what Factorio never did. They just announced an price the game was worth. And when ever they made big additions to the game, they increased the piece, since the product got better and more worth. Totaly legit. 

Making a post and what I assume, is spreading hate over wube for compensation of inflation, is just not right"
Terrorscream,"most of my older games have done a similar thing, apparently steam is harassing them to do so(prob so it can get a bigger cut). not many of them have made announcements though"
64gbBumFunCannon,"Shame, guess I'm never buying it.

It's not that I can't afford the extra $5, it's the principle."
flapjacczacc,"when will they realize that we all know that inflation isn't real.  


a while ago i went to go buy a copy of factorio for a friend and the game was $40 CAD."
Matix777,Imagine they discounted it by exactly 16% lol
DocBullseye,...are they still adding content?
mataco817,"I would gladly pay for both, they are worth it"
rokiller,Annoyingly my copy is on epic 🙄
Bingohead,I feel like even if I paid $75 for factario I really like it and have played it so much I still would have got my moneys worth. Inflation sucks but I’ve always felt like factario gave me a lot of bang for my buck
Professor_pannell,It’s on sale so you can buy both games and loose connection with everyone you love because the factory is all that matters now.
Amnesia_daddy,I love both games ♡
je-brault,"55,39€ well spent. This two games are incredible."
Johnny_Blaze000,"This situation about factorio raising their prices will always be controversial because once you already purchased a game, you are immune to future price increases and it no longer affects you. But if you are looking at buying factorio, I can see why you would be upset because old games generally go *down* in price not *up* as time passes."
JaxckLl,One's worth it at $35. The other probably isn't even at C$20.
Jizzdom,Is satisfactory fun?
ombus,After 700 hours this game can cost 120...
Luder714,"I have both.  I bought Factorio first and then Dyson Sphere.  I tried but failed to get into either.  Satisfactory checked a lot of boxes that only a select few games ever have.

The design elements in Satisfactory are the thing that does it for me the most.  I have cleared the last tier so far and have all the upgrades and all but a few hard drives.  Every time I load it I plan on building an awesome factory that combines everything, only to get distracted on something else for 3 hours or watching Kibitz or someone else make something awesome instead."
Wicam,Since when did games increase in price the older they get?
DemonicTheGamer,"I paid 20 Canadian for satisfactory on launch day and now it has like triple the content it had at launch, I feel like I practically stole it lmao"
Raphiboiii,And I was hoping that Factorio would be in promotion soon so I could buy it...
Dom9789,Factorio and Rimworld are similar in my mind. They never go on sale but are definitely worth the price
parkrain21,Still more bang for the buck than most games priced $60
EX7mattchew7X3,"Understandable, have a nice day!"
TwinSong,I already own both.
Detector_of_humans,Common Satisfactory W
BoxHillStrangler,I could have paid 200 bucks for factorio and still never got more value for money from a game.  Satisfactory is getting close though.
comuter83,Well one game is worth every penny and even more. The other one not so much.
Surprise_Corgi,It's not nearly April.
DarksArts,"They’ve already sold like 3.5 MILLION copies on steam alone, surely 7 years later they can go without even more infinite money ???  Idk even if they need the cash, the precedent is that digital only games get cheaper over time

Edit: past me made a cringe take sorry for the cringe, also apparently you can edit posts that’s cool"
BLUEAR0,How about the game got older? Are they stupid?
StreetBobber103,I understand that satisfactory is factorios child from another dev. But factorio sucks lmao
Sangui,"If I could refund Factorio I would, but I doubt Steam will refund me a game i spent 11 hours playing over a year ago."
