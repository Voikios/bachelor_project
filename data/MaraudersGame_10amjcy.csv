itsamorosemanatee,Mans peeking like its siege. Well done sir
PalisadedHeart,"Man, you're the one that is lasering me and my friend in our ships lol. Your aim is impressive, especially with those headshots."
stocklett,"nice, and all on a vertical cell phone screen!"
TTV_xxero_foxx,"I love it. Only thing better than solo wiping a squad is doing on their own ship. Fyi you can shoot through those boxes even at range without any penalty, so if you line it up right you can smoke them without ever needing to peek"
So_bored_of_you,I would be so pissed off that was my squad. With the 9mm no less good shit man I hope I don't run into you out there
Moist-Advice-2308,very intriguing movement ifw this
Ok_You_3672,Do you happen to have the names on the captains card of those victims? That seems vaguely similar to how my team died üòÜ
WiseGuye,If only more people leaned instead of cutting corners lol.
Jaiples,How do you know how many people are on the ship when you breached? I usually solo and I get got by ending up against 2 or 3
