{"Title": "Don't kill streamers if you want to keep your account", "Post Text": "**First off this is not meant to attack Rengawr in any way, I don't blame him for the way he reacted**\n\nTwo days ago I killed a chad on woods. I could tell he was geared so I decided to unload into his legs with my EKO. He made it to cover before I could kill him but I pushed up and finished him off with 2 shots to the ankle. As I was looting the body I was shocked to find that he was already lvl 53 and a sherpa. Because of this, I decided to check if he was a streamer.\n\nThe very first twitch streamer I clicked on, Rengawr, was running the exact same kit as the dude I had killed, so I assumed it was him. I went back over the vod and sure enough there was the clip of me killing him.\n\n[https://clips.twitch.tv/FuriousOutstandingRaisinFUNgineer-cEqN9TeA2NLhvmV7?tt\\_medium=redt](https://clips.twitch.tv/FuriousOutstandingRaisinFUNgineer-cEqN9TeA2NLhvmV7?tt_medium=redt)\n\n[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1704182268?t=2h40m23s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1704182268?t=2h40m23s)\n\n(Start of fight)\n\nAbout 20 seconds after the clip ends he says \"He'll be banned within 10 minutes.\" He also claims he is going to get me \"manually banned\". He personally dm's a dev a clip in order to do this.\n\nI can totally see where he's coming from. I definitely would've reported that too, but the truth is I pushed up, RIGHT WHERE HE WAS LOOKING, and shot him in the legs 2 more times. This is clearly desync. We have all died countless times when we should have been in cover, but we were not on the other player's screen. I got a little freaked out hearing a big streamer/sherpa say they were going to manual ban me, but I knew I had nothing to fear since I don't cheat. The next morning:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/zTXKKK8](https://imgur.com/a/zTXKKK8)\n\n1700 hours, 35% survival rating, and a shit K.D.\n\nI understand if you don't believe me, but I've never cheated or broken any rules in my 5 years of playing this game. It sucks I don't have my POV to prove it, but I'm not a streamer and I don't record my games. It seems crazy to me that a streamer can personally get someone banned based on nothing more than a suspicious death. I went into his chat the next day to ask him about it and he ended up re-watching the clip and seems to no longer think I cheated.\n\n[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1705161929?t=7h33m43s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1705161929?t=7h33m43s)\n\n(start of him reviewing clip)\n\nSide Note: Rengawr ended up asking me what ban code I got and I totally gave him the wrong code, 206. I saw 206 because I typo'd my password. Once I fixed the typo I got the real code, 229, which by his own words is a manual ban.\n\nAnyways, it just doesn't seem right that a streamer/sherpa should have that kind of power. I'm no different than any of you, I don't cheat and I just play to hang out with my buddies. After 5 years, a streamer decided I was cheating, the next day my account was gone.\n\n**UPDATE AGAIN:** [**I've been unbanned!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10dpz45/unbanned_dont_kill_streamers_if_you_want_to_keep/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**UPDATE:** [**https://imgur.com/a/E60bG6X**](https://imgur.com/a/E60bG6X) **:/** (he deleted this original clip and vod)\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for all the support everybody. An awesome streamer and BSG emissary /u/trentbraidner has reached out to me and is contacting BSG in order to get me unbanned. There are good streamers and employees out there.\n\n**TL;DR:** I killed a streamer, servers made the kill look sus, streamer thought I was a cheater, streamer claims to manually ban me and I get banned. The streamer then went back and decided I wasn't cheating, but its too late and I'm banned. Time to get good at Dark and Darker.", "ID": "10b70ec", "Score": 19903, "Total Comments": 734, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10b70ec/dont_kill_streamers_if_you_want_to_keep_your/"}
