AeternusDoleo,"""Note. FICSIT is not responsible for damages incurred due to load exceeding crane design limitations, including but not limited to spilled cargo, damaged rail infrastructure and vertically compressed pioneers."""
dddd0,"Hoisting equipment has huge safety factors you see, so a 20 ton crane really has actually no issue lifting 80 tons or more and it'd be very wasteful to not use equipment to its fullest potential."
Sunskimmeraroo,Those FOOLS. how am I supposed to play now with such unrealistic numbers?!
Arbiter51x,Isn't the gravity lower on the planet we are on. Maybe it's 20T on earth and closer to 80T on the planet. (though I don't think the gravity is 4x less).
SysGh_st,"How do we even know it's at max 20 000 Kg on these cranes?  
You're referring to the 20T model number? It's just that: A model number.

Clunas,Literally unplayable.
ulthrant82,"A bag of concrete weighs 30 kg. There are 3 of them per unit. Each slot fits 500 units. Each car has 32 slots. 

A traincar full of concrete weighs 1,440 tonnes."
houghi,As if  Ficsit does not really care about your safety.  And  they will  blame  you any way.
StructureOk8023,"This must be fixed ASAP!

But what about stuff like Nuclear Pasta?
That stuff distorts space around it its that heavy"
Daroph,Safety third!
Bilson00,"You goofs, itâ€™s actually 20 TERAFLOPS"
jkay2,When keeping it real goes wrong
Jamesmor222,"that is for safety, cranes can actually lift way more that the number they have marked on then and the weight is distributed between both of then but because FICSIT doesn't care about safety we are ignoring the recommend weight and go extreme"
lainverse,Have you taken into consideration that we can both produce and transport nuclear pasta? That's kind of unusual matter you may find at the core of a neutron star. 98.000 kg is a drop in the ocean in comparison.
CurlsCross,"T is actually specific to lbs. 1 ton is 2,000 lbs. not kg."
Ralph_hh,"I imagine they built that crane on earth, capable of carrying a mass of 20tons - weight of approx. 200,000 Newton. Assuming that Massage Asteroid is quite small, gravity is also quite small, so the weight of a waggon containing the mass of 1,400tons of concrete is maybe small enough to be lifted.

Some maths: This means gravity must be less than 1/70th on that asteroid. Gravity correlates to the asteroids / planets mass which is dictated mostly by volume (Assuming it consists of the same material - Silicon oxides, Magnesium oxides, Iron). The diameter goes in that with V=(4/3 pi r\^3), so the asteroids diameter must be approximately 1/4 of that of our planet earth.

While this is absolutely plausible, that 1/70th of gravity would make jumoing pretty easy, you woud be able to jump up cliffs, you may not need these boots and you accelerate downwards so slowly that you should be able to jump down from just anywhere unharmed.

\-->So either that crane is labelled wrong or the effect of physics on the player is poorly done."
Anastariana,"Low gravity planet!

At least, thats my explanation."

RednocNivert,How much would a cargo car full of Nuclear Pasta Weigh?
rtchau,Ssshhhhh. Donâ€™t mention it and itâ€™ll probably be fine.
sir_ramen,Literally unplayable.
MrUniverse1990,Maybe the crane itself weighs 20 tons.
kodenami,I've always seen this game and liked the concept. Seeing this post and watching a couple yt videos it's really cool you can design your own track plans etc for trains. The train aspect might have won me over.
Linwood_Longstrive,How do you know the weight of an item? Is it by calculating the density of an ingot or something else?

Sipstaff,"Maybe it's just a designation, not the rated weight limit. It's just a train station crane version 20T, following the minor improvement of 20S, but much better than the 19 series."
torgefaehrlich,">  We use kilograms as both a unit of weight AND a unit of mass.

And incorrectly so, weight (force) should be decaNewtons (daN, approximated)

Edit: I started this comment as a reply, but somehow the context got lost in the mobile editor while trying to switch focus for copying the cited text (I ended up re-typing it)"
Embarrassed-Jelly-96,"Well actually the SI symbol of a metric ton is a lower case ""t"" so the ""20T"" does in fact not mean 20.000 kg but is probably a serial number of this standardised piece of equipment"
ValientBacon,Literally unplayable
wivaca,"Hey, dont look at me.  You built it."
Vivid_Investigator97,"The mistake you have made is assuming the force of gravity is the same in MASSAGE-2(A-B)b in the binary star system of Akycha as it is on Earth. The weight of the car is 1/5th the weight as it is on Earth, therefore the crane is safely within FICSIT regulations. Please carry on with your duties and stay productive!
