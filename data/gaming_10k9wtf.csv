Kodekingen,My mom just told me to get off the computer and now I’m laying on the couch next to her scrolling through Reddit while she’s watching the TV. Some parents are just so weird
kykiwibear,My dad used to play video games with me.  He was in the military and deployed. alot.  You are still bonding and making memories.
elspith16,"There are hundreds of articles saying that video games are good for so many things like critical thinking skills and hand eye coordination. I would search for an article from a source she would trust and show her the benefits. I'm a gamer mom, we also play board games, and I've never regretted letting my kids play video games. It might actually be a better hour spent engaging with the TV rather than just sitting idly by watching it."
RascalRibs,"Yea that's a weird stigma that's still around today. 

Maybe look up some articles about it.   

Not really sure what else to suggest."
ayeeflo51,get the whole family to play Wii/Switch Sports
DylonNotNylon,Buy them Magic: The Gathering cards and teach them to play. She'll be begging them to buy a new Ps5 game in under a month
Odd-Soil-7922,"This probably isnt the healthiest way... but, in my experience, if someone is judging you on any ""screen time"" realted issue and you shine a comparetive light on that persons smart phone usage, they tend to clam up  pretty quick. Almost everyone could afford to spend less time on thier smart phone."
captain_nibble_bits,"I also had this a bit. Though it never was toxic. My partner had more problems with my son gaming than watching TV.

I just kept explaining and showing her the advantages. So she's not 100% changed but she does see the advantages it gives.

He learned a lot more math with gaming than from his first books. Also he solves problems on his own and knows his way around a pc.

I don't see that many things he learned from watching paw patrol. Lol"
ZylonBane,An *hour* of TV *periodically?* Did you marry a Mennonite?
jibbyjackjoe,"My son is a good kid. When he's out of school, he can do whatever he wants. That is his time. He did what he needed to in school. 

He and I watched my girlfriend replay Wind Waker for a bit. He was asking all the right questions about heroes and helping people out. It was fun to cheer her on. And the soundtrack! Music in games is so underrated. 

There are games that are stories. There are games that are puzzles. There are games for competition. They are all okay in moderation. 

You need to have a conversation with her, as an adult. Set the tone from the get go ""I want to have a serious conversation about your view point of gaming"". 

If she won't listen or gets defensive, you have a different problem."
Rad_Dad6969,"I agree that gaming isn't detrimental, especially at just a few hours a week, but reading 

""I'm just so sick of her poisoning my bonding time with the kids with braying negativity about video games. ""

leads me to believe the issues are deeper. Talk to your wife, talk to a therapist if you have to. But understand we strangers on the internet are not going to give you healthy relationship advice. 

You will always be able to find info supporting your viewpoint online, no matter what that viewpoint is. Don't ask the internet to win arguments for you. Talk it out homie"
hershko,"You need to treat this as a relationship issue, not as a gaming issue. You want to bond with your kids doing something you like doing. It's not harmful for them (certainly not more than watching TV, which she's fine with). It's only one hour a week(!). And yet she finds it appropriate to poison this experience for you. 

Assuming you spoke with her about it, made it clear this is important for you, and she still persists, you need to seek advice on your relationship (e.g., perhaps it's time for couple's therapy, for instance)."
seenew,"couple's therapy, if you're describing her as ""braying"""
wjmacguffin,"Maybe let her know this. 

I have an M. Ed. I taught at elementary, middle, and high schools for 10 years and was a principal for five more. I have studied this to help parents understand the situation. 

1. Video games are generally better than TV because games are interactive. They require using your brain to solve problems. Video does not; it's a passive acceptance of what's on the screen. 
2. Children under 2 yrs old should not have any time with a screen. Once they start getting older, it can gradually be added. One hour of video games and/or videos *per day* should be fine as long as your kids are in elementary school. 
3. Like it or not, games are a big part of our culture these days. Letting kids play popular games and watch popular shows/movies can help kids fit in with their peer group and increase socialization. (It's not a lock but it can increase the odds.) 
4. Every child is unique, and your children may have special needs that make video games less or more harmful. But outside of major issues like autism, such needs shouldn't be a problem. 
5. Video games can increase violence in a small percentage of the population but that's mainly for kids who already have violent tendencies. Games also do not act like violent catharsis; playing a violent game doesn't decrease the chances of violence either. 

One last thing. Sometimes, people don't want to know the truth if it forces them to change. Sounds to me like your wife means well but is stuck in an older mentality that video games are evil and teach kids how to be killers. Maybe have a rational, measured conversation where y'all go over her reservations specifically, not just that she doesn't like it, and brainstorm ways to address her concerns."
Suni221,Show her how brainwashing the tv is
STJ41,"Damn. Why did you married an elder woman?

No, but seriously. How that happened? I guess you are here because your really like videogames, and idk, I can't figure out how you stayed with someone that is so ignorant and against something that you like.

Like. Idk, something like that would be such an turn off for me in a relationship."
Tergrids_lantern,"The way I've always put it to people is that I generally prefer my entertainment to be actively engaging, sure, I could watch a movie or show about surviving in a post nuclear wasteland. Or I could play fallout, and explore on my own. I'm also relatively sure(not certain) that there may have been some studies about the benefits of gaming on one's problem solvingand/or critical thinking skills."
hylian_ninja,Get a new wife
cheetonian,"Dude, are you really gonna ask for marriage advice on the reddit gaming forum? Fucking talk with her and explain your point of view. If you can't do that, what even is your marriage?"
extreme-psycho,"Your wife didn't rationalize herself into this so no matter what research or opinions you bring , you won't rationalize her out of it."
Tricky-Reputation957,You need to find and then show her some of the studies done on video games.  Specifically the ones that determined that video games teach you about problem solving and engage your mind more than tv. Also show her the ones that determined gamers are smarter and more creative than non-gamers.
chicagotim1,"I would start by not trying to convince her about ""beautiful art"" she just won't buy it even if it's true. Arguing videogames are no worse and maybe even better than watching TV is probably easier to convey."
puffmaster5000,It's great how much your wife respects you and the things you do /s
SadLaser,"Find some documentaries, some studies, etc that show that video games do have benefits in terms of mental development.  There are probably some cool videos on the topic on YouTube, too.  And I imagine there have been studies comparing the direct involvement of gaming versus the passive involvement of TV watching and there's no argument that gaming is more mentally involved."
GlimmerMage12,"Depending on the game, the kids could actually be learning!  Having them interact with the screen can keep them much more focused than a tv show can.  

But I definitely think trying to find a game that she enjoys too will help her understand."
tigress666,"Heh... my parents, especially my stepmom, were very much a get out and play. That being said they never limited my computer time (Which I did a lot of gaming on) cause they figured that was constructive at least where as I could only watch an hour of tv....  Granted it is more cause they figured the computer = constructive and probably ignored how much I gamed (as they would not buy me an atari as all I could do was game on it).

It just is funny to me now you hear these complaints about people thinking tv is ok but gaming is bad.   


I'd say tv rots your brain but these days I think social media may be the worst cancer for kids."
J-Dabbleyou,"Literally video games are just tv but it engages your mind lol, if anything, games are BETTER than tv"
Paulb1231,Both are perfectly fine activites in moderation and neither is lazy. Realistically if you dont let your children partake in video games and televison you will be setting them up not fit in with the vast majority of their peers which will be way more damaging in the long run than a few games of mario kart or episodes of Bluey or whatever.
ElmoKnowsYourSecret,"Television is blindly staring at something that does all of the thinking for both of you.

Video games are interactive and require response and thought.

And she honestly thinks the games are worse?"
HypothermiaDK,In what world is watching mindnumbing TV better than actively engaging your brain and motor skills with gaming.
PilchardTale,"The video games are a red herring, and not the issue.

Why is she actively denigrating you and your kids when you're doing something she doesn't do? Why is her way the best and only way to do things? 

Are you actively excluding her when you play games and she's reacting in the only way that works to get your attention? Does she do all the non-fun parenting / SAHM? What hobbies does she have, does she ever get to do them?

Do you guys actually discuss anything, or does she tell you what is happening and you accept it? Why are you asking strangers on the internet instead of talking to your wife?

Do you have anything in common except the kids? Do you even like each other? Can you talk to each other?"
i-love-k9,Show her the studies that show games improve cognitive abilities.  In truth your wife sounds like a condescending bitch and you probably need to send her in for repairs and upgrades.  You might be able to do it yourself if you teach her how to play games too.
ranqr,"Sounds mean-spirited.

Does she generally not let people enjoy things?"
sunbear0326,Lean into the learning in video games.  Problem solving and what not
RandomUser0666,"A video game is essentially an hours long exercise in hand-eye coordination, reflexes, critical thinking, problem solving, attention to detail, and reading comprehension. Study after study shows how good for the brain games are. Stardew Valley could get someone interested in the economics of business. A soulsbourne game is all about problem solving and situational awareness. Darkest Dungeon can teach an important lesson about being comfortable with impending loss and that it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. THe Fast and Furious game really reinforces the importance of family. The list goes on."
Ecstatic-Positive239,Bro why are you on Reddit and not communicating with your wife
Blazer323,"The military recognizes that video games help maintain higher reaction times than not playing at all. I've learned way more word definitions and themes from video games than TV. Learning split second reactions in racing games has trained my muscle memory to react properly when a bad driver cuts out into traffic. Industry has used ""video games"" as training tools when live drills are too dangerous or expensive for 20+ student classes. Real, professional racing drivers use games to practice real world tracks and keep sharp."
FatalVisionOrez,Divorce.
SensiStar613,You poor bastard
5teerPike,"Have you talked to her about how she's making you feel?  Your bonding time is important, video games do demand a little more skill than just sitting and consuming. Does she play many herself?

Do you play games that aren't violent? 

I love all sorts of video games, but if she walks in the room and only sees the violent ones that may have an effect on her perception with this. She probably doesn't let the kids watch things like breaking bad, for example."
TheHancock,"I HATE, like my biggest pet peeve, when people say playing video games is bad and then go and sit and watch TV for hours. Like at worst it’s the same thing. I’d like to think I’m at least using my brain and hands playing video games."
Upstream-moonbeam,Get a new wife
Number-1Dad,"My mother would tell me all the time what a loser I was/would be if I kept enjoying video games the way I did when I was young. I'd never amount to anything. 

My mother and I are no longer in contact and I build rockets for a living."
Starsinger17,"Shs may be jealous that you're bonding with the kids ""without her"" and views TV time as a family activity."
llhht,"There are much, much deeper issues here than anything to do with video games. 1 hour of game playing per week is not even enough to be worth mentioning. It's about as noteworthy as ""I go ride a bike once a week for an hour.""

Throw aside games for a bit, this sound like its time for therapy, and a lot of it."
SentientCrisis,You’re an adult. You should have an adult conversation with your wife instead of describing her as “braying” and “poisoning” your time. Start by treating your spouse with the same basic respect you’d appreciate and build a relationship of trust and respect.
heloxcuseme,I don't understand how people get married to people who are more akin to an out of touch boomer parent than a partner. Having an SO like that would drive me up the wall.
OokySpookums,"Find a game for her to play with the family. Show online communities having fun together.

Don't bother showing her articles on how gaming is helping people with dementia, depression and loneliness. Probably won't read it or absorb the knowledge."
Zeelthor,"So hang on. You have a way to hang out with your kids that you do once a week and that you all enjoy, and your wife finds it appropriate to give you shit over that? You're bonding with the damn children. That's awesome. Sure, some games are not appropriate for some age groups, but to claim all games are bad is as stupid as to claim all movies are bad.

She's being absolutely unreasonable."
coryeyey,"As a gamer who had parents who hated video games, please find a way to get through to your wife. What she is doing is actually quite harmful, especially if your child is into video games when you're not around. As a kid playing video games I was made to feel like I was wasting my time and rotting my brain (much like OP's wife is saying). Which is obviously not true, but even if it is, so what? Kids are meant to have large amounts of play time, and if video games can be seen as a waste of time then so can play time. Let kids be kids, and don't try to dictate how they do it."
snakesbbq,Maybe have a conversation like adults with your wife?
Own_Comment,‘Poisoning… Braying negativity’… yeh either get a lawyer or a therapist my dude. The level of contempt in the language you’re using isn’t indicative of a healthy relationship… video games completely aside.
Kangabolic,"I’d ask my wife if she could produce anything real that actually confirms her statements. Depending on your relationship that might come across as combative though. I’m in the sciences field and so my wife kind of expects this response from about things like this, and we’ve both talked about that it’s “not my job” in our relationship to “prove her wrong” so to speak, rather we both need to try to speak about what we actually know and is real. This probably sounds worse reading this than it is in reality, it’s honestly one of the best strongest parts of our relationship.

If not in a place to ask her to “prove” her statements/fears a quick enough search in your own will produce an immense amount of real data that shows kids today that play video games are more socially apt in school, are better at presenting things to their peers, and overall excel more on average in group situations than kids that don’t play them. All the negatives from the 80s and early 90s that your wife is probably remembering we’re literally just made up."
thatjawn,"Jesus those kids must be miserable, periodic TV and video games once a week. I feel for em. Kids need stimulation what do they normally do? Crosswords?"
jaidengamerhd,your wife is lame
waterbottleman142,Anything is OK in moderation
whererebelsare,"Honestly, you have to spend time finding her type of gaming. Unlock her passion for a game and you've made an ally for life. I had to listen to the criticism my wife had about games before I found one she had no complaints about. She didn't like poor/old graphics, she didn't like timers, and nothing fast paced. Got her into Skyrim, and final fantasy. Now she explores other games on her own. 

It may help to point out to her that this advice came from a couple who games together. We are both very successful, we travel, we volunteer with the community, and we game together and separately. Been together ten years now."
GrumpyButtrcup,"Your wife sounds like she'll be wondering why her kids don't call her later in life.

Controlling parents are the worst parents. My mom was like your wife, even tried locking the door to the room my computer was in. Now on top of programming I also know how to pick and shimmy locks, know how to be sneaky and manipulative, and became comfortable with lying all before I turned 16. In fact, I was so interested in computers that if she just indulged my interests instead of trying to mold me into something I wasn't then I likely never would have started sneaking out of the house to smoke weed and drink during high-school.

Literally everything my mom did to try and stop me from engaging in my interests just became a challenge. I call her once a year now. On Christmas. So her grand baby can say Merry Christmas."
StabbyMcFishFace,"TV is more mind numbing by a longshot. At least with video games you're a pivotal part of the action, and get to make your own decisions. You're encouraged to think critically, something TV rarely does."
Y34rZer0,if she’s having a go at you for bonding with your kids that sounds a bit unfair
Crimson_Cain_333,"D i v o r c e

aarplain,I tell everyone who will listen that I’d rather my kids play video games than watch tv.
lennyjew,"https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2012/07/video-games-or-tv-which-is-worse.html

The article is a bit silly but the hyperlinks send you to some of the studies they refer to.

Also just google ""watching tv vs playing video games research."" There are a decent number pretty much stating that watching tv requires no mental effort where video games can build on problem solving, reaction time, and various other things depending on the game.

Considering how little truly educational TV is left I'm sure whatever your wife is letting them watch is mentally stimulating and beneficial."
Beansupreme117,Jesus she limits tv to an hour “periodically”

Far-Manufacturer-209,Elon Musk always credits video games for getting him into tech. Not saying your kids are gonna turn into fucking Elon Musk but video games really are art in so many ways.
milehighcards,Divorce
ptvipers,"You may want to check razbuten on youtube, he's got a playlist of videos called ""gaming for a non-gamer"" in wich he lets his non-gamer wife try a variety of games, he comments, talks in depth about what she struggles with and things he notices, something we often dont realise when playing ourselves is that we take a lot of knowledge for granted that is pretty hard to grasp if you have no clue whats going on, its hard to value a sick combo in a video game if all you see is a couple of random button presses without context of the game knowledge and timing required to pull it off. We know that a red barrel in an fps-game will most likely end up with an explosion if we shoot it, a lot of us will load up a new game on the pc and try to press space to see if we can jump, we'll try to walk off the nearest edge to see if falling off is a risk we need to consider, games have a pretty extensive ""language"" that carries over from game to game, to get your own wife involved or opened up to it more, it might just be a matter of finding a game that will properly teach her some of those basics, or alteast realise that its more than just a couple of buttons and a pretty picture"
Vostroyan212th,"Tell your wife you are going to do stuff with your kids andnthat she can fuck off? If mine tried that I would definitely laugh in her face and tell her to pound sand. But thankfully she isn't nuts and plays with us.

Oh and I'd start them each a warhammer army and myself a new one, plus get her one at the same time. The starting cost for 5 of you getting 500pts would cost probably $1000, of course you need paints, a bunch of plastic buildings to play on, other tools and books, etc. So maybe $1500 on the low end after taxes?"
seamore555,"You like video games. Your kids like video games. You enjoy your bonding times with the kids.

The answer is to keep doing it, and tell her that’s what is going to happen. 

Then, just keep doing it.

Stop looking for her approval. They are your kids, you can make decisions like this for yourself.

Do things for yourself and then carry on. Stop looking to have your wife approve of all your decisions.

If she doesn’t like it she can sulk her nights away in the bedroom. Just means more video game time.

Once you begin making decisions for yourself, your wife will begin to respect your decisions."
Here_Forthe_Comment,"The best way to get her over it, aside from showing studies, is to invite her to play. At the very least you can convince her it's a good way to bond and maybe she might pick up the hobby herself. There are some people that will demonize video games regardless of what they see so don't be surprised if she's one of those people. Always good to try to include her just in case."
buraisho,Do we have the same wife?
Angry-potato-2122,"It’s a lack of understanding. Video games are actually beneficial. Eye coordination . Reacting , problem solving , creativity . There’s all sorts of games that actually improve the brain . More than a TV ever would."

icantshoot,Man up and tell her shes wrong.
FullAhjosu12,"I actually do a seminar for Parents on Technology. One thing we talk about is evaluating what is happening through the technology. For instance if your kid is playing football they get exercise, sure, but they also get teamwork, communication, planning, thrill of victory and defeat. Same is true of team matches in Fortnite (except exercise). A lot of games have puzzle and critical thinking aspects. Playing cooperative games is a great way to bond with your kids and work towards a common goal. It can even be a teaching time to go over lessons your family wants reflected in their values. Hope it helps."
FoobarWreck,"Shout ""FINISH HER""

She'll soon see the value in it."
Redzonedj,"I still play video games with my Dad. He's 62 and I'm 24! 

He's the one that introduced me to the Nintendo and PS1 when I was a kid and I've been playing videogames with him ever since! We used to sit up for hours together on an old PC game called ""Total Annihilation"". 

I moved out a while back so it's nice to spend some time with him, even if it's on a game! He will still text me after we've played a few rounds of COD to say how much he enjoyed playing.

It's something I'm really glad we get to do still. He will watch endless YouTube videos learning tips and tricks to surprise me when we next play. 

Gaming is a great way of bonding and staying connected, even long after your kids move out of your family home. 

Don't ever give up on that!"
nullusx,"To be honest TV does less for the brain than videogames, so your wife is actually doing more harm to your kids. Playing videogames actually seems to increase inteligence according to some studies, while TV and social media consumption doesnt seem to affect it."
biscuity87,"An hour of tv or an hour of video games is frankly ridiculous.  Especially when there is really not all that much to do right now.

An hour is not even enough time to watch a movie.  Are you telling me you can’t watch a movie with your family?

There are shows out there with like 150-250 episodes.  Good luck ever watching any of them kids.  They are going to end up being the weird kids who don’t understand any references.

The whole video games vs tv argument is moronic.  Reading a book for hours = fine.  Watching tv for hours = fine.  Video games for hours = fine.  Which of these forms of media can you actively fail at?  Video games of course.  But she can’t participate in them because she’s too lazy to learn anything new.  Any idiot can sit and watch tv."

C250586,"My daughter was given pretty much unrestricted access to things like YouTube, Minecraft and other forms of screen time from a young age. We played hundreds of hours of minecraft together from age 7, and overwatch, borderlands, and 7 days to die as she got older. 

She is now in her last 5 months of high school, is a straight A student with a 92% average, is highly adjusted, has good social circle, and actually refuses to watch tv if she has homework or studying to do. She also loves outdoor activities and is healthy and fit. 

She was just accepted into medical engineering at the university of her choice.

It's almost like ... Playing video games did not rot her brain. 

In my own experience as a parent, arbitrarily block access to normal things like video games and TV does WAY more harm than good."

Additional_Care_409,"If anything watching the TV is more brain rotting than playing the video games , though it does depend on the games , though at the end of the day if she allows them to watch the TV for an hour what's the difference with the playing of games. Sounds like she just doesn't like the video games"
T_Bagger23,If you want to argue that both are bad and both are brainwashing then do that but there is no question you are using more brain activity playing a video game then mindlessly watching bullshit tv.
RiotSkunk2023,"To me a video game is better than tv. They have to actually process information, hit certain buttons and read rather than sit there and drool into the light box"

CaptHorney_Two,"If she likes to read, there is a good book called ""Everything Bad is Good For You"". Studies have actually shown that video games can be beneficial.

AutomaticOrange4417,"I would start by resetting the conversation. How much video game time does she think is reasonable? How much TV time does she think is reasonable? 

Then, if she's being reasonable, you can make a schedule and keep track of the video game time to show that you are still within her expectations."
Zmirzlina,"Find a game she can play with you all as well? As my kids got older I started playing less video games and more board games. We’re usually gathered around the table after dinner for an hour or so playing board games 4-5 nights a week. Seems to eliminate both tv and video game time and we work on problem solving, communications, and winning (and losing) with grace."
RobTheMonk,I used to have this argument with my Mum when I was a kid. I'd play 4 hours of Pro Evo and it was the worst thing ever. She'd then watch 4 hours of the Big Brother live stream lol.
Bobbert_McGee,"If the content is similiar for age group and not educational, watching TV is objectively worse for them."
ThiqCoq,That's f***** up because television is obviously way worse than just a simple video game but games dont necessarily have to Decay the mind games require critical thinking unlike watching television which consists of programs. Programs. Programs!    She's backwards ass and needs to meditate. Lol  she probably watches the news too am I right
m2thek,"In addition to showing the potential benefits of playing video games, it's worth asking her and exploring *why* she has a problem with them and not TV."
sfPanzer,"lol my parents were like that as well ... 16 years ago! Watching shitty tv shows all day? Perfectly fine. Playing a video game for an hour? Stop wasting your time, it's not good for you!  I'm still laughing. Though it's ridiculous that there are people in 2023 who still act this way."

Awesomocity0,I'm an attorney. My husband is a software engineer. We both grew up glued to the TV playing games. We still play games together and plan to play them when our son is born. Happy to talk to her about all the ways video games helped me in life.
Idealistic_Crusader,"Ask her; In what ways are the kids using their brains while watching a TV show?  What show are they watching btw, is it an educational one about how the world actually works?

Ok, now educate her on how much brain activity is going on while playing a video game.  Your reacting, planning, developing a strategy, acknowledging a system, responding to that system, learning, and developing hand eye coordination. 

A 8 year old kid once safely steered a car off the road and brought it to a safe stop along a freeway, after his grandmother suffered a heart attack at the wheel.  When asked ""how did you know what to do? The boy responded, ""it's just like playing mario kart"" 

When did Blues Clues ever save anybodys life?"
Sagybagy,"My wife asked me one day why I would rather play a video game than watch tv.  I explained it to her like this.  

You watch a show.  You sit there and observe.  Using your imagination to ride along with that show and it’s characters.  You are always just the passenger.  

When I play video games I am not just observing.  I AM the main character.  I get to determine the outcome of the show.  My actions directly impact what happens.  Instead of just riding along, I am interacting.  I have to be involved and making decisions.  Sometimes snap reaction decisions.  I am engaging my brain in active tasks.  Far more healthy and better for the brain in my opinion."

I truly believe playing different types of videogames allow you to learn more, think strategically, solves puzzles faster through critical thinking, learn words/grammar, think about the artistic intent and/or creators purpose of the story, etc."
HelloS0n,"New wife, new life"
WearifulSole,"You can look up articles on the benefits of hand-eye coordination. But at the end of the day, I would just ask her ""Would you rather we stare at the glowy box and vegetate or stare at the glowy box and be engaged and exercise hand-eye coordination?"""
ElwoodJD,"Games are generally more interactive than television. I find my kid doesn’t glaze over like he can do with some tv. Puzzles, hand eye coordination, and bonding. Sounds like a great family activity."
TomBel71,If she’s one of those anti gamers get that divorce now while it’s cheaper
melograno1234,If you play civ - there was recently a study showing that people who play the game have better managerial skills than non-players
iWillSmokeYou,"She might have been brainwashed by the media and thinks that all games are violent. 
Have a serious talk to her and tell her that you’re gonna play with your kids, no matter what she thinks. You’re not abusing your kids, you’re spending time with them. 
Alot of kids who don’t get their parents attention turn out to be criminals.
You’re the father, you get to say what happens around the house too."
Thelightsshadow,Has something happened to her that she views this as a negative? Like her family or something?
Hoptix,"Tell her exactly what you told us. That's incredibly frustrating OP. Don't let her do this. You guys are playing a fun game together, solving problems, having fun and making memories. I'd guilt trip the shit outta her over this one."
Mouse0022,"Video games are a great way to bond. It shouldn't be the only way but can't discredit it's still a great way. My husband plays games for hours with our kiddo. It makes her happy. She's 4, and already reading and doing math. Has pretty much excelled single digit addition and subtraction and we will be testing double digit math soon. I don't believe screen time is the problem. But the content they are seeing and doing, and the interactions they receive from caregivers that help learning and confidence."
Ehrre,"Tell her that many neurosurgeons and other specialists literally play videogames on off time and it does not impact their ability at all.  

Games imo, are much more engaging than TV. With TV i turn my brain off unless the show is really really good.  

With games you are actively moving a character around and thinking and problem solving."
subtleanarch,"That’s crazy. 

I’m 30 years old and the earliest memories and most fun memories I have with my mom are playing Nintendo & Super Nintendo when I was a kid. 

We use to play some game where you’re a scientist & you have to work as a team to press buttons on different areas of the level and let the other go through. Literally taught me how to work as a team. 

Luckily now there are studies that can prove that no one’s brain is being poisoned. A PowerPoint? (I’m petty sometimes & this would be my go to 😂), some YouTube videos showing the data of video games and the effect they have on the brain?

Show her these Reddit comments and show her real people that have grown up with this poisoning of the mind from video games with their parents and how it’s not true."
Realistik84,"38 father here and would favor hours of video games over even a little TV.

Video Games:
- strategy and problem solving
- cooperation and collaboration 
- competition 
- learn basic asset management and consequences of actions
- great for social circles
- prepare for the future as gamification will takeover all forms of education IMO"
More_Lavishness8127,"So many people still have this mentality. I’m 34 and have been playing games since I was 4. 

The look and comments I get by colleagues (mostly female) that are my age is always the same. 

“Really? You play games?”"
Jessiefrance89,"I’m a gamer, ever since I was a kid and my dad played games with me on the Super Nintendo. And currently, I play every single day. I’m also in college and have a 4.0 GPA. So, take that as you will but I kinda feel like if my brain was rotted from video games I wouldn’t do well on school lol."
jmarzy,Just divorce her
onlysurvivalism,"Does she use a cell phone or social media? If so then she really can’t say anything but I couldn’t be with someone that ignorant. I’ve been in a happy relationship for ten years with my girlfriend and we both love video games, I wouldn’t be able to be with someone like your wife lol. That is some old school out of touch parent think."
SecuritiesLawyer,"She has cognitive dissonance and doesn't realize how obtuse she is being so try to be as understanding of her ignorance as possible, but you should only increase the amount of time playing video games with your kids."
theslack,"Sounds like your wife doesn't value your opinion or knowledge. And is unwilling to accept that you may be right. That's toxic. 

I think this may be indicative of a much larger issue."
Spire_Citron,"As long as the games are age appropriate and it's not the only time you spend one on one time with your kids, I don't see the issue."
CaptainLookylou,"I was more well read and spoke more fluently than anyone in my class because of video game dialogue. The reading your kids will do in an RPG is as much as any book and they will love every second of it. 

Let's not even get into exploring their morale development. Choosing right or wrong and the consequences for both is super important for growth and video games are a safe space to learn."
LeonidasSpacemanMD,"When I was a kid my mom was insistent on me playing baseball because I needed to get exercise. It’s funny to think of that now because we’d rush through a fast food place and I’d eat some absolute garbage junk food because we had no time, then I’d go play baseball which is like one step up from golf in physical intensity (you have to run *maybe* 200 feet every 10-15 minutes on average, and that’s probably exaggerating)

Now I love sports, I would’ve played basketball (a sport that actually does keep you in shape) every day until bedtime if I could. But the point is that people kinda just have an idea in their heads of what kids “should” do, and it’s hard to shake them out of it even when it makes no sense"
SlotherakOmega,"\*sigh\*

Aight mate, here is how you do it.

This will probably be best on a computer, or with a Nintendo console.

Find a good puzzle genre game. Not like Candy Crush or Wordle, I’m talking like Myst, or even better, The Witness. These are games that have no inherent violence in them so that argument is gone. Next, have THEM try playing the game. The Witness is a very easy to understand, challenging to ace game. There are walkthroughs on it, so don’t worry if they get stuck. Theres a hidden message in it. It’s not obvious unless you really look for it. Same thing with Myst, although it’s much harder and not exactly replay worthy. Then once they’ve finished those games, show them another game of a different genre, not horror, not FPS, but adventure/rpg/jrpg. It’s a very different game experience, but now we approach the idea that puzzles exist even in things that aren’t labeled puzzles. Next, introduce them to a more advanced genre: survival. My recommendation is Subnautica. It’s a great game and the sequel is just as good. It’s a fairly intense game, as it is horrifying at parts, but this is the important part to introduce here. Here we are now FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES. Against things like we will never (hopefully) see in real life, but using (somewhat) realistic skills to overcome natural problems and limitations. It’s still puzzles. They are just the more un-fun puzzles, like how much titanium can I carry in one trip, how long can I take to collect that much, and how many trips will that take to finish building my add on to my base so I can store more stuff and have more things in the base. Or how long until I need to reoxygenate, and am I close enough to air for that to still work without an act of god. Or, how do I distract this horrifying monster from trying to eat me, and how do I get rid of it should the distraction not work. These are the puzzles that games inherently teach us to be able to solve. They are not exactly *fun* puzzles, but the satisfaction once you are proven correct is more than adequate. Incidentally, on these three occasions you show them the beauty of modern games.

Final step. Splurge and buy a pong console. You heard me. The OG pong console was never truly documented because everyone made one back then. Show them the first commercially sold video game in its entirety. The first sensational game that made everyone either excited, or confused. Then show her the others. And point out that it’s been about forty years since video games started with Pong. Almost a half a century. And Subnautica, the Witness, and The legend of Zelda are results of those forty years of development. We came from square pixel balls and single digit scoreboards, with two colors only, to breathtaking vistas of alien planets hellbent on making sure we never leave, and if we do, never return. Vast landscapes that are chock full of activities that constantly engage us with tasks to train our mind to work harder with less reward. And bizarre places where we are the last ones left, but strangely we have access to everything necessary, and everything is connected… somehow… and the messages of the most influential people in philosophy and science speak their mind to show a decent contrast between the various paths we face and how to approach them. These are result of *beep beep beep boop* being so popular that there was an overwhelming number of types of the game sold. Show her cave drawings and ask if she thinks that those rotted the brains of the cavemen who drew them. Play music from the early 1900s, and ask if that music rotted the minds of the musicians of the world (or go even further back, to Bach or Mozart). Show her the silent films of the early twentieth century and ask if these documentaries are more decay-inducing than the National Geographic documentaries produced today. Then ask her about video games again, and how they can possibly be brain warping if they are interactive versions of all three of those genres, and more of it at once, too.

I had a similar struggle trying to convince my family that video games were a great thing to play for your mental health, as they promote the most important skill of all time: thinking outside the box. Portal. Experiment number eighteen. I guess I just die, right? Lol, no thanks, I’m just going to head on out now. Later GLADOS. Oh NOW you want me to stick around, huh? Hmmm, well that’s not happening because you have already played your cards and I am not playing that game. Minecraft. Well, I guess I just have one instruction, to press Q to get the inventory screen, right? No, there’s far more to it than that. DROD (deadly rooms of death). So I basically just hit things with swords and kill them before they kill me? No you f###ing donkey! You have to think! That roach is way too close to kill right now, you need to reposition yourself to a better location so you can kill it! Don’t panic, because every room can be completed (in theory), but you plan out your moves properly and you will always win. Video games love to pull the hit-n-run mechanic on players, the “Gotcha” rule. There’s always a catch. Trust nothing and no one. You know that you are going in the right direction when things happen to try and stop you. Sometimes the most effective way to do something, is to let something else do it for you. Wisdom is crammed inside this form of media, and only by playing it, can we actually access this valuable knowledge and experience."
kefaise,Thanks to games I got into programming. I can’t see how watching TV could do the same.
charleshuntington,Well you are so unfortunately I have to agree with her. My love and passion for video games is a curse on my life and if I could go back in time to when I was young and never actually start and live a more productive life I would.
Hardwork_BF,"I used to play RuneScape daily and really got into merching items on there. I had a bunch of spreadsheets with prices, quantities, profit, dates, etc. Did this for years finally got enough for a phat…few years later I ended up moving up at company managing inventory levels and pricing. Boss asked me how I was so good with no experience, I told him I just like spreadsheets and left it at that. I wouldn’t have a job without video games right now."
Josuke96,"Some of my best memories with my Dad are on Halo 1-3 (especially Halo 1) and COD Zombies. We would play for hours, he bought a second console and tv so we could do LAN parties at the house, and we’d be shouting throughout the house to give orders to each other. Happiest days of my life, even all these years later now that I’m in my mid 20’s. 

Absolutely beats the shit out of watching TV. If anything rots your brain, it’s the activity that doesn’t engage you or make you think at all."
ABL67,Active hand eye coordination is better than passively watching TV
MrTUBESSSS,"Tell her to go fuck herself? If you are this upset by it that you need to ask Reddit it sounds to me like this is a huge issue for you personally. I'm sorry to say it but your wife sounds like a narcissistic and selfish person. My wife would never tell me what I can or can't do with our son, unless I was planning something outrageously dangerous, then she might pass comment. 

If I was you I'd continue doing what you want with your son. If she continues to have a problem with it I would seriously evaluate your relationship, because if she is like this on a topic seemingly so trivial I'm sure she is just as controlling in other areas of your life?"
Iwillnotbebannedthis,Be gentle with women. They don't have hobbies.
Vladomirtheinhaler,I don’t have kids but my wife will do similar to me. If I’m watching TV by myself or with her or if she’s watching TV by herself or with me it’s all good. 5+ hours of binge watching is completely fine. But let me go play a video game for 30 minutes and she acts like I’m a lazy piece of trash that never does anything. Lol I literally keep up 6 acres of land and work a full time job and workout 4 days a week without ever missing a day. I’m one of the least lazy people I know. Something in her brain has been convinced that video games=lazy loser. I think it was the fact that her parents act that way about video games and her brother is a huge video game nerd. It really annoys me because I love playing video games. I very rarely do it like maybe a couple hours a week. It’s my time to go to another place and forget about the world during the rare periods of time where I actually have free time to enjoy. Idk man I think woman have been conditioned to see guys that play video games as video game nerds. Maybe 20+ years ago only nerds played video games. Now everybody from NFL superstars to political leaders play video games. Idk man woman are crazy.
AccomplishedSucka,Playing jrpgs made me a maths whiz as a kid compared to the other kids in my class
newocean,"This was my parents way of thinking.... TV is ok - but video games rot the brain... they were a little worse than just that (in some ways) like, to punish me they would take away my computer so I couldn't learn to program (""computers are just a fad anyway"")... etc.

Anyway... I would buy her a book on a topic she hates. Then, I would constantly remind her that instead of watching TV or doing whatever she likes... that it rots her brain and she should be reading the book you picked out because reading is better for her.

Get her a book on video games.

If she tries to argue that it's not helpful for her to learn or read it. Remind her she is READING and it's much better than watching TV or whatever her hobbies are.

Perfect book - Getting Gamers: The Psychology of Video Games and Their Impact on the People who Play Them"
FadeawayFas,"We’re on Reddit so I’ll stick to theme here… you need to divorce her pronto, get tested for STDs and get you and every family member into therapy. It’s the only recourse, obviously."
Merlinshighcousin,"Meanwhile the gaming is encouraging problem solving parts of the brain, hand eye coordination and you 2 are bonding while doing this... but sitting infront of a tv for a hour with no social interaction or ability to join in on what's going on is actually brain rotting..."
DoggievDoggy,"Video games teach; 

Patience,
Trial and error,
How to handle victory,
How to handle defeat,
Problem solving,
Resource management,
Teamwork,
And Hand eye coordination.

And last but not least, you can build friendships.

I remember when i first got Xbox Live in 2006 and i started playing Gears of War and I would always match with this dude.

We eventually became friends to the point i was a groomsmen at his wedding last year. We are like brothers now. 

Too much of anything is bad for you, but gaming has so many upsides, I don’t think I’ll ever stop"
DaddyJBird,"It’s different in my household.  I have four daughters and video games on a console is very much okay.  There is more talking and socializing when they play video games than TV. Their favorites are GTA V first and COD second.  They also have VR.  All doing great in school.  My oldest is 21 and will be applying to med school next year, my second just got a 50% academic scholarship from her University.  The others two are still in grade school and both honors  students."
Foodcity,"Ah yes, how i developed time anxiety. Whats going to happen is they'll spend the entire time trying to min/max what they do, end up doing nothing, and be pissed off about it."
dirtyfingerling,Lol well educate her about how much worse TV is for your kids (everyone) and she'll flip real quick.
8OnAGoodDay7IfNot,"Depending on the games, and shows, the games are likely to be far more beneficial to their motor skills, critical thinking skills, math skills, reading ability, and other important skills they're developing. What's better? Zoning out in front of a tv and effectively shutting their brains down to maybe let some information slip in? Or actively engaging their brains with challenges to their problem solving skills, reaction times, and hand eye coordination? If you really want to do your kids a favor tell them for every hour they want to watch TV or play games they have to read for an hour first."
DarthNutsack,Some of the best surgeons in the world use video games to improve and refine their hand eye coordination and dexterity.
Pesime,"I hate that stigma so much. Everything in moderation and we aren't trying to justify playing video games all day every day as a good thing but so many people, even younger people I grew up with in the 90s, absolutely will not let go of this ""brain rot"" mentality. They always say to do something more productive and you ask them like what and they say read a book. I always follow up by asking what books have you read lately. It's always the same answer."
Neat-Fee-3218,"Don't you know how bad games are for kids?!
