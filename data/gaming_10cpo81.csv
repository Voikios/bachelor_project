Quetzalcoatlasaurus,When you're so confused by the enemies move you punch yourself in the face
MartinOdeg8d,"Now that you mention it, it actually does make sense lmao"
,This move hits so hard. Machoke doesn’t stand a chance
Kiri_the_Fox,"I see a lot of comments trying to explain it but I feel like it's:

The Pokemon using Swagger does exactly that, they act like they have this swagger like ""Hey I'm better than you, no way you can hit me"" (especially since swagger is naturally learned by a lot of dark Pokemon, so think of it like an underhanded tactic) and the opposing pokemon gets super pissed off, increasing it's attack power, but also putting it into a blind rage (which is a type of confusion imo).

Source: Scrafty and Krookodile are two of my favorite pokemon and they both learn it naturally, and it seems super thematic for these gangster Pokemon to act with swagger and piss off opposing mons."
HaikuBotStalksMe,"I'm pretty sure that confusion determines how much damage it does by taking your attack into account. 

So by increasing your attack, you take more damage when you hit yourself."
pwalkz,It's called swagger. The Pokemon becomes overconfident and hurts itself out of hubris.
Doobledorf,"Swagger means the pokemon using the move essentially taunts the other pokemon into angry and wreck less attacks. Your pokemon adopts a swagger, the other gets upset and and does dumb shit. 

Never understood why people don't get this. It's a love that can be learned by practically any pokemon because it is just a behavior you could do in a fight."
leijt,Machoke used pound.
KainBatrius,"The first time this move was used on me in a game, I saw the attack boost and became confused myself, then saw the confusion and realized."
Moses_The_Wise,"I always assumed Swaggering pissed them off enough that they got angrier (and thus hit harder), but also made them reckless because they're so POed"
tolacid,"In the Disney movie *John Carter,* an ordinary man is transported to the surface of Mars. Ignoring logistics like how he survives the atmosphere, the planet's lower gravity makes him capable of superhuman feats of strength. The first time he tried to walk, he ended up leaping several dozen feet and landing on his face, thoroughly perplexed.

This is literally what happens with Swagger."
TheRaven200,Makes too much sense. This must be the canon explanation.
LevelStudent,Swagger is one of those pokemon abilities that I'm pretty sure it's only in the game as a ability for the AI to use to make the player feel smarter. The sort of thing that lets you win a battle that you never would if they just used basic attack abilities the whole time.
TheWinterPrince52,"I always saw it as ""They show off so hard that my pokemon flies into an offended rage.""

Or they just swear at my pokemon.  I named a Vespiqueen ""Karen"" recently because she swagger'd my Pikachu until it's attack stat was maxed, then the Pikachu snapped out of confusion and brought it into the red with one hit. XD"
J-Hart,Machoke got some big ol pecs here.
McJumpington,8 year old me casting haste on enemies in ff7
DeviousDeevo,He thinks it's a bad hypno dream so he's punching himself awake
CrescentCleave,"My interpretation of the move is that the caster acts like a jerk, infuriating the target, raising their attacks but since they're annoyed, they don't think straight thus confused"
WigglytuffAlpha,"While this is very funny, technically we know that Pokemon boos their attack and defense when they're pissed (in PLA if you fail to catch a pokemon it can grow enraged and boost all its stats) and I guess Swagger is a move where a Pokemon angers the opponent so much that they become blind with rage and thus confused. In short, Pokemon have anger issues, and worse, it makes their punches hurt many times more."
StoneySteve420,Best to use on special attackers.
Astonsjh,I should punch myself to see if its true.
ThePowerOfStories,"Reminds me of *Friedrich Nietzsche’s Art of Fighting*, where you only have two moves, one that increases your opponent’s strength and one that kills him instantly."
Jesumistro,Hypno looks like kilroy
SuzanoSho,Bro started hitting himself to test and see if it hurts more than normal.
WuShanDroid,"I mean... if you're using swagger on any physical attacker you're REALLY asking for trouble. If they break through it, you're screwed. If you can't kill them before they snap out of if, you're screwed. But if you *can* kill them before they snap out of it then dont waste a turn on that status effect, just damage them directly instead!"
KingZantair,"I always took it as them pissing you off. You’re stronger, cause you’re pisses off, but you’re also less likely to actually be accurate, cause you’re pissed off."
NotTheCraftyVeteran,I’m convinced that confusion via Swagger makes Pokémon hurt themselves more often the via other moves. Bane of my existence as a kid.
Catboxaoi,"If OP is actually curious why this happens, it's because damage you take from confusion is based off of your ATK. It's an interesting move because of the risk-reward and mindgames depending on the target. On enemies with only special attacks, that bonus ATK is purely a downside but the enemy probably doesn't have much ATK to begin with. On anything that actually wants that ATK, you're taking a big gamble to potentially deal tons of damage to them or you."
dadlookididathing,HAHAHAHA omg! This just made me cackle
Pixeljammed,I find swagger hilarious because I suck at Pokémon and had to make a team one so I just put “swag” into the move pick search and gave it to like 6 psyducks
BeTheGuy2,I figured the one that uses swagger is so cocky that it's opponents fly into a murderous rage.
kunell,Ok how the hell is flatter supposed to work
DarkseidHS,"In competitive pokemon it actually has a lot of uses. 

The attack foul play is calculated using the opponents attack stat so raising that means they take more damage. 

If a pokemon is a special attacker raising its attack is meaningless. 

Thats just 2 off the top of my head."
Sammy_Socrates,"I actually JUST learned recently that it's because when you hurt yourself in confusion it uses your attack stat. So they raise the attack and use it against you, potentially."
ImmoralJester54,I make you stronger so I can have a real challenge weakling.
SenpaiSwanky,"It’s more like a huge rush of power lol, like such a huge unexpected boost that the Mon can’t properly control it right away so they get confused"
Material-Permit9685,We do a lil trolling
Mokida,"*Laughs in switching out said pokemon to keep the buff, and switch them back in later to use attack with higher stat to match* Opponent’s shock Pikachu face OoO"
Sailor_Lunatone,Swagkey flashbacks intensify
MISTABOBBDOBALINA,"But it's sunday....

MISTABOBBDOBALINA became confused!"
Rayward-Vagabond,How would swagger work on gholdengo?
Geoclasm,Quit hitting yourself (harder)! Quit hitting yourself (harder)!
ExceedAccel,The way he leaps off of rooftops and flips backwards to face the camera before falling into a head first dive is just full of the exaggerated SWAGGER of a Black teen.
daer-bear9999,It would make sense if confusion was a useful status in comp.
andrewuliu,Haha why does this make perfect sense
Entropy_flipside133,To confuse you to the point of mental breakdown also to hypnotize you easily due to the mental confusion.
Accomplished-Set-367,Lol this is funny
Narwalacorn,"The way I always thought of it is that it makes the other Pokémon really pissed off at you, akin to an angry drunk person swinging punches really hard (attack increase) but really wildly and out of control (confusion)"
Zandrick,I think it’s supposed to be like they get so riled up and aggressive they stop thinking clearly.
jag986,I always thought it was because Pokémon doesn’t have a Berserk status.
lallapalalable,Just remember to carry your white herb and all will be fine
thethethethetheuhh,"Don't know if this is the right place to ask, but if you use swagger on a Pokémon that can't be confused, would it still raise there attack or do nothing?"
RandomPhail,"Wtf does swagger even look like as a move (never seen the anime more than like ~15 episodes) I doesn’t make sense to just be the little spinny thing depicted in the comic

Is it just like a really cool looking walk that pisses the enemy off for some reason? Lol"
thRINZIman,"It's a goad AND a punishment for responding to the goad!
I never thought of it like that. Pair it up with additional on-attack penalties, or better, forced attacks and you've got an engine!

Does such a thing exist?
I wanna do that."
RuggerJibberJabber,So this is what happened to McGregor
M0NG00SY,"Yea I'll be honest, 34 prime 1st generation lover. Didnt figure this out till maybe a year or two ago..."
Paulomatico123,"In German it's called ""Angeberei"" which roughly translates to ""showing off"" or ""boasting"", which I think actually makes sense. You're making the enemy angry, which makes them stronger but also unable to think clearly."
CDR57,I always saw it as “X uses swagger!” As basically taunting or infuriating the opposing Pokémon to the point where they go into a blind rage
The_Pupp3t33r,Perfect
Horn_Python,The swag puts them in a blind rage
cataloop,Manchoke became Bi in its confusion...
Low_Pie_3302,"Whenever I see a Pokémon use swagger, all I can think of is that 2012-2015 era aesthetic when the word swagger was popular- and I imagine Hypno with a flat bill hat and his middle fingers up in a cringey pose"
kajigger_desu,Swagger
randomleopard,It will all make sense once he evolves
Shujinco2,I just got swept to this because the Starmobiles are immune to status effects.
unforgivablecrust,It's best when you pair it with foul play to one shot your opponents
Gangsir,"I've always thought this move was... very bad. Like okay, you raise their attack by 2 levels, and confuse them. 

Self damage from confusion IS based on attack, so if the confusion coin flip succeeds (and it literally is a coin flip up to gen 6, 50% chance, down to 1/3rd chance in gen 7 onward, making this move worse) they *will* take more damage... But confusion self damage even with that is usually like 10% hp or so.

Also, confusion is a volatile status effect meaning it cures itself after some time... but the attack bonus doesn't go away.

If the pokemon doesn't die while confused from itself or others... you now have a +2 attack-ed pokemon that's gonna proceed to delete your team (provided they're a phys attacker like machoke is). You can use swagger again to re-confuse them... but now they're +4 attack-ed. Fail the coinflip? Get one-shot.

This gets even worse if they cure the confusion immediately via item. Or if they baton pass, which cures the confuse but hands off the attack bonus to the next pokemon.

I just do not see the value of this move unless you're just full on gambling that you can use it like a really shitty protect to avoid some big move they're cooking up, and kill them the next turn (or if they're some psychic type special attacker and the attk bonus doesn't matter)."
claraa_lilyy,I have always wondered about this
RageTiger,"Persim Berry, Lum berry, or even Covert Cloak  that shuts that down quickly."
electricdynamite,That's what I'm saying. My head's all tied up like a pretzel. I got a pretzel in my head.
BadassToiletNinja,"I imagine the goliaths from borderlands.

I FEEL POWERFUL!!"
Noobynunya,Hey I got stack of Pokémon at my dads house
thelastanchovy,I never imagined Machoke using words with more than one syllable.
zyrtsuryu,"I just always assumed it was a way to introduce an ""enraged"" style mechanic without making an entirely new status condition.

The opposing Pokemon has their strength increased but is less likely to hit you."
GodsFavMoron,The Waffle House has found it’s new host
BigOleFerret,That's exactly how I always thought of it
coreylongest,I don’t remember but does the damage a confused Pokémon take correlate to their ATK stat?
crimsontape,"I walk with a swagger!

everyusernamewashad,When they're cooler/sexier than you and it makes you angry... but you don't know why.
Admirablelittlebitch,"My toxtricity used to know swagger and I was so confused as to why, then I realised that it was actually a pretty good move"
Cheese_republic,Tinkatons Own tempo!
A_Jellysandwich,Ah yes my favorite Pokémon hypno
Spiritual_Cross,I understand the memes here but I'm pretty sure a pokemon like Machoke couldn't do all that math in the backround of the 4th scene
bloomingfireweed,I've just assumed this is how it works since the move was introduced.
concernedexpressions,They are boyfriends.
Senpai_Lynx,One psybeam would knock him out on one shot. Much quicker and safer. Confusion is too sporadic
Saminjutsu,"""Wait... Could this be a trick? Am-am I actually stronger or is this just one of his mind games? I-I don't know! I need to test to see if I really am stronger! What if I punched myself really hard in the face to check?"" 

*Machoke hurt itself in its confusion!*"
toshineon2,"The fact that this status condition is even named confusion confuses me. I mean, a lot of moves that causes it seems to suggest that the Pokémon actually gets dizzy."
Clamato-e-Gannon,I just have to comment that I used to see a POGO player in gyms by the name MachokeMyNeck. Brilliant.
Cinerae,I always use it vs special attackers
iMittyl,"I like to picture the Pokemon using Swagger doing a 2-step, with the opponent getting mad and missing the shots they throw, eventually punching something solid"
Milak221,Machoke eyes exactly show his confusion. I always wondered why our pokemon did not attack their master when confused.
TrueDreams4U,"What you thought swagger was: Cripple enemy special attacker.

What it really was: prankster swagger substitute."
EdgyNickname12,"To be honest, when I was younger this was how I actually saw it. 

I didn't realise that it was more of an angry, flailing response to someone being an arrogant such-and-such."
To_Fight_The_Night,I always assumed they were not prepared for the extra Strength so they go too fast and hit the wall kinda like high jump kick missing and that is why they take DMG.
Sand_Content,"Hypno is a master of manipulation.

Reminded my man what swagger really means. Looking like an idiot, being proud of your idiocy and never change. Machoke wonders, why do I feel strong from a sense blind pride? Why is my power increasing?

Once someone stops telling you how great you are for being an idiot, you start seeing your idiocy for what it is? Validation after years of bullying from having 3 pizza pans being stuck in your head..."
Skydragons00898,lol actually good
Pranav_RedStone971,damn
kick_his_lights_o530,Swagger's ability to confuse Pokémon causes them to injure themselves more frequently than they would otherwise. The bane of my childhood existence.
Happy-go-luckyRec149,"You misunderstood ""swagger"" to mean ""cripple enemy special attacker."""

hey_there_kitty_cat,"Is this a hot take?  I thought that was a given, they get a bonus but also a confusing possible negative... I didn't think we needed a cartoon to explain it more."
Whitealroker1,"Sleeping with Pikachu….cute

Sleeping with Machoke….weird."
TitleComprehensive96,"doesn't it also lower enemy defense?  

the same type of skill exists in SMT called ""Taunt"" where it will increase physical damage, or general attack, or enemies but dramatically lower their defense"
Itachi_888k,It was to confuse him. And it worked.
