bit32x,The game Rust used to have this issue. I think they added some kind of fog at night and when you turn your gamma up it turns the game white.
KibatsunaGatsu,Tbh I scav night raids. If the weather for the raid is windy or pure sunny the moon light is enough or you can make your postfx black and white and you can see
Jertzukka,People out here acting like gamma and brightness are new things.
Fictitious1267,"Something weird I noticed yesterday is if you enable noise it increases visibility in the dark just a tiny bit, and no it's not the noise particles making the screen brighter."
Myythy,"I remember when everyone did this in rust way back in the day, made my game look like a youtube video from 2009 lol"
ST-Helios,"i just wish this wasn't a thing but that's asking too much, i'd genuinely love to run nightime if i could reliably use shadows and light covers to move around, it's already pretty hard with the moon but gamme and tweaks make it worse

Heck, was pretty fun when i tried a bunch of times last wipe but it ain't worth handicaping oneself and i'd rather play daytime if i have to play with gamma and whatnot this much"
froxezaen,Do flashlights blind you with this setting?
Operative427,"I have gotten so good at Woods stash runs that I can literally do it in the pitch black with only seeing the Silhouettes of trees and pathways, I occasionally run into other players but if you just stop moving they usually can't see you because it's so damn dark"
DisGruntledDraftsman,When you pair this technique with black and white settings in game. It's as bright as day. During the rain storms you can see much better as well even at night.
Sazbadashie,You guys can't just... see in the dark?
AWD-ESTATE,"I wish the game watch pitch black at night and you had to use flashlights, no nvgs in the game. Would be so terrifying and awesome. I love night raids"
MoBZiKK,Small pp energy
TheRealCRex,PostFX should auto-disable on night runs. Ridiculous to be able to cheese this way.
IIIbeer,"Or just run night raids when you have nvg's and/or flashlights?

This is pathetic and I have never understand this bs. Same thing when dudes buy 3000‚Ç¨ pc's and put graphical settings to minimum and disable shadows because you can see better but the game looks like dogshit. Why buy decent hardware and look at shit that look like its from 2008"
2B_LEWD_BUTT,Lame.
Beer-Wall,Yeahhh see the thing is I hate making my game look fucking dumb so I play as intended.
Oknamehere_4980,"or you could just idk, play the game right?"
Dwenki,"Seem like i have an answer at my question ""Did that tree shot me dead ?"""
,Spreading this information only exacerbates the problem vastly
lilschreck,This kind of stuff will always exist. If you really want to get a competitive advantage you can also turn down other graphics settings like foliage. People do that in plenty of games. Also marking your center screen with a sharpie so you know what‚Äôs dead center. I don‚Äôt do any of these (besides some in game post fx settings to make colors a little more vibrant and sharpen textures) because I still want to enjoy the game. Not create an overly competitive sweat fest. There‚Äôs already enough things in this game that get my heart racing
Jaidonio,Way to encourage more people to not have fun with NV and flashlights
Le-Misanthrope,"Also if you have an ASUS monitor you may have something called Shadow Boost, you can enable that and use whatever setting to your preference. It will light up the shadows A LOT without being over exposed. However outdoors in the daytime it does look too bright. I use this function a lot in every dark game I play. Hunt Showdown and Tarkov are my main games I use it in."
LodgedBlock,Role players are pissed  lul
straight_lurkin,I mean I'm fortunate enough to have a nice monitor and can plenty fine at night
P0werEdge,"so many butthurt shitters in here lul, bruh this has been since day 1 turning your brightness up to be able to see."
helpmepleas1,This is cheese‚Ä¶
Strange_Perception_2,"another tip: use postfx brightness at -100%, it makes it so that if a flashlight is aimed at you it's still possible to recognize the silhouette of the person within the white circle on your screen"
Daleee,"No gamma settings irl though. No issue with others changing these kinds of settings, I just enjoy the game more."
PrincessBabyDave,So many little bitches in here crying cheats holy fuck this is hilarious üòÇüòÇ
JustSeraph,"Dude this is like saying: everyone on labs is cheating, so I‚Äôm cheating, but they did it first, so I‚Äôm not cheating anymore‚Ä¶"
spacemarine1800,People out here acting like Night time in Tarkov is dark. Sure you can't make out details that well but in most places you can see someone's silhouette from 100m + away.
KaserinSmarte421,Took a screen shot before this probably gets taken down. Yoink.

smokintheQOOSH,"‚Äúit isn‚Äôt a cheat it‚Äôs literally a windows monitor setting that every single person with windows has access to‚Äù

‚Äúit isn‚Äôt a cheat it‚Äôs literally just a website with tarkov hacks that every single person with a computer with internet has access to‚Äù

just because i CAN cheat like you does not make it not cheating.

if you need to close tarkov and run some other application/program/setting on your PC to compete you are a loser and a dweeb"

PeetShepherd,"I use the same post fx I always used and window settings,  I don't manipulate anything to see at night because I don't do a ton of night raids and I like the night vision or flash light aesthetic but rooms in reserve and such are so much darker now.

Did they make the blacks blacker or am I just not remembering how dark some spots on maps really are.. like the stairs you'd take to get to the d2 switch room I can't see SHIT lol"
JebstoneBoppman,It's like when you would crank down particle and foliage draw distances in games so you could see someone trying to prone through tall grass as clear as day and just shoot the shit out of them.
Seenot77,"lol @ gamma abusing and acting like it's some revelation.

Either you enjoy night for what it is or you play daytime instead of abusing settings like a sweaty little tryhard"

SaltyBumRyu,"When you need to up your gamma, you know you did it wrong. I just have my postfx to where it is and I can see fine at night. Unless it rains or it's overcast skies."
Scavwithaslick,"Go to post fx, put it on Fahrenheit, turn up to 100, turn brightness and saturation to 100. It looks like Mexico and flashlights are flash bangs, but you can see down dark stairs like it was day"

RespectGiovanni,"‚Äúuntil bsg finds a way around it‚Äù

Wtf do you mean find a way around this?? Do you want them to install an anticheat to block you from changing your monitor settings? Seriously dude"
DigbyChickenCaeser1,"You can achieve similar results using post fx. Helpfully everyone has access to it and there are you tube guides on how to set this, for those of you clutching your pearls about cheating, you‚Äôre welcome."
Vubor,"I can also run nearl perfectly fine at night atleast through customs, some people maybe should turn up brightness instead of having it on ultra low."
DzelzisZnL,"I try to do full moon /clear night raids..
And rainy ones for quests, which involve locations.."
LightningBlehz,"My monitor has a ""Night Vision"" mode in its settings and it just raises gamma based on whatever the monitor thinks makes most sense"
nikMIA,Nvg are still giving the best picture
silentrawr,"FWIW, it's more efficient to this through the NV Control panel (or AMD as well, I'd assume), than through the janky-ass Windows settings applets. But good on ya OP for spreading this knowledge."
KlutzyAd5729,I run so many night raids I can just tell when people are close its weird but like I got this sixth sense and shit
FEIKMAN,"My monitor has a Game Mode option, where I can select few presets. One of them happens to make everything brighter, adds a little bit of grain and huge sharpness. Perfect for games that are naturally dark."
Nokami93,"It's literally the same as just increasing gamma within your nvidia panel or just on the monitor OSD itself, but it comes with the downside of not having additional stuff like the contrast. So there is no point using the windows function as both nvidia and amd have this within their drivers with additional functionality.

What you really want are technologies like [black equalizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6xPFjKa_M) or equivalents from other companies. They have direct control over dark pixels and can make them more visible without sacrificing the whole image for it."
KevitoMG,I‚Äòve just lost about 8 NVGs in the span of two hours. I think I‚Äòll just use this method‚Ä¶.
TheGentileGiant,"Meanwhile actual NVG users arent allowed to scope without getting their entire screen smeared with black fog

I get that some people will always exploit, but atleast allow the larpers like me to have fun"
TheRealChoob,My asus monitor has an shadowboost feature. I just turn it on.
shtgnkllr,"NVG's are like 30-40k and I see way better with them than this. I killed many people in bushes that thought they were invisible when they stick out like a sore thumb in NVG's.

Also my monitor has black equalizer which is MUCH better than this :\^)"
JustForThis167,Theres a way to apply a color filter to see factory at night. It inverts the colors and you see red lines everywhere
Ok-Life8294,I only go night time to do quests and avoid assholes trying to kill me doing my quests. I go without nvg
FilthyPeasant_Red,"How is this gamma slider different than the one in Nvidia control panel? I use this one to adjust other things like the saturation but i'm wondering if this one is different.

Edit : Yeah it's essentially the same, but Nvidia gives you more options."
Flanked77,Lol we‚Äôre gunna get rust nights now. Pitch black. Gunna be sick actually
MaskedHeroman,My eyes adjust at night and I can see pretty damn well in the dark the fact that your characters eyes never adjust is truly daunting to me and I utilize gamma so I can play without eye strain call it a crutch if you will but the lighting in the game is horrible
Popular-Willingness4,.
WhatRobulus,"This might be the one part of this game that I want bsg to Nerf. Not dogging anybody who does it, its totally legal and isn't rude to do. I just wish I could play night while knowing everyone else either has night vision or is as blind as I am."

That way I don't ruin screenshots or vids either."

Rosa_Ratnika,"""...it would be dope if everybody was forced using NVG..""

Eugyoli,"The people complaining here are the same that cry under speedrunning videos, calling them cheaters and glitch abusers"
DrakeV3,"You use gamma to see in the dark  
I use gamma because my monitor is OLED and it's so dark by default I couldn't see shit even in midday, clear sky day (Tarkov is the only game that suffer with the OLED monitor btw)  


we're not the same  


btw, anything over gamma 1.5 would just destroy image quality overall"
ApeOfDiamondz,This used to work years ago. But it‚Äôs nowhere near as good as it once was.
ButterMakerMoth,"Yes but also some people just have no sense of direction.  They struggle at daytime then complain about night like it's supposed to be easier. Especially when people are in teams . 
I was ratting signal on shoreline with my trusty short Mosin and heard these 3 elephants tromping through my woods. So I laid down and was going to let them pass. They all have nvgs mind you and I don't. I can see that glow on their dumb faces.  I don't even change my settings for night raids. One of these idiots stops to check his bag I'm guessing and I had to end all of their lives bc of his mistake. Even by the third guy he had no idea where I was. I was laying down on a knoll with no cover. He had a nice AK and nvgs . He was looking right at Me but never landed a shot. Ended up mag dumping into the general area when he saw my muzzle flash . But the 2nd LPS took his life. These guys ran within 15m of me.  I wasn't in a bush.  Wasn't behind cover. I was in an open patch . They had every advantage on Me."
RDP8,Yeah doing this and raising the brightness in postfx makes night time super clear.
E_Wubi,"I use flashlights a lot, if you crank up settings to see without a flashlight, flashlight are unusable cause way too bright.

Price of nvgs is not the problem, the problem are that you dont can barely see past 50m with nvgs (the expensive one is the only really good nvg). Cheap nvgs are sadly gritty af.

Cheap nvg still better than no nvg + gamma settings."
smithmeister6996,"The best way to do it I've found is cranking up black equalizer on my monitor, don't even need to take a flashlight to night interchange lol."
SignalHamster,"for me it just washes everything out, i crank everything up a little with control panel but i usually still have to use a flashlight occasionally or from choice to blind."
SandmanJr90,good shit man. I been using my monitor post processing but this seems more effective thanks for sharing. I love interchange night runs and never use NVGs cause it‚Äôs not worth the cost imo
Never-breaK,Might as well just remove night time raids at this point. Cheesing legit players ain‚Äôt cool.
furious-fungus,Lol bsg needs to fix these monitors!! Can‚Äôt they make a law or something??2?2?
NewHendrix,Yeah but it makes the game look like shit. I‚Äôd rather pay the extra 100k or what ever to immerse myself instead stare at a washed out image just to see the dark
MrSMIIITH,I run night raids all the time and was wondering how these dickheads were doing it. Here I am risking an extra roughly 100k with helmet NVG and a dude in a tan ulach is popping shots at my from 100m or more.
Undead-Latte,"I'm up voting this because I find it interesting and props to you for finding that out but as everyone says this game needs to feel like your getting kicked in the balls.

 I personally think it should get fixed for more gameplay realism. But if I'm correct it's a computer setting not a game setting so everyone has the option to use it. 
But it is discouraging for the people who try to practice and put hours into their own skill just to be spotted by people who don't care for tactical gameplay and look to pick the game up for a couple days and screw over some pretty good players. 

Then again dealing with cheaters and exploiters just help with my point. ""Should feel like you're constantly being kicked in the balls."""
DelugeFPS,"They could do what Rust does and literally make the textures on every asset darker (only at night though) whilst adding a thick, intrusive wall of anti-gamma fog to night maps.

But I doubt they will, it is BSG after all. We'll probably be in 2025 and night raids will be the exact same as they are now."
GregasaurusRektz,Just buy cheap nvgs and a head strap.  You‚Äôll make back the money very quickly - run in to so many duos I can wipe because they thought they could do a night raid with just a flashlight
chroeboy,I truly appreciate you explaining this to me! I for the life of me couldn‚Äôt figure out how tf people were seeing me when they didn‚Äôt have NVGs.  Now it‚Äôs time I play like they do.
NammiSjoppan,"my postfx makes everything look pink/redish at night and i can see people super easily as they stick out as black human like blobs, i can also see super far. Don't even need a flashlight at woods."
CritiqOfPureBullshit,"\- It isn't a cheat, it's literally a windows monitor setting that every single person with windows has access to.

&#x200B;

just because everyone has access to it, doesn't mean it's not  a cheat. using features outside the game to literally make an intentionally dark map lighter without the required gear is cheating, or at the very least using an exploit to gain an advantage over other players who might not even be aware of it.

&#x200B;

you're reducing your risk by doing a night raid (vs PMCs), but then you're changing your display so you can see better, which goes agains the initial tradeoff of doing a night raid vs day raid."
AbsolutZer0_v2,Would you draw a cross hair on your monitor ?
BusterOfCherry,"I use the black settings on my moniia d can see everything, the only map it doesn't work on is factory"
Davies301,Alternatively you could just edit your post FX which is built into the game and can give you the same advantage.
Tex302,Yeah but what if I want to get my Boogaloo on with my Nods and IR flashlight.
alcoholicprogrammer,Imagine going to these lengths to get a leg up on other players in a video game. God this is cringe lol
Sargash,"Because the night raids are bright as fuck? You don't need to gamma boost to see most of the time at night. I have a very well calibrated monitor, and I can see fine without NVGs for most of the night. NVGs do help but I can navigate the entire time without an issue."
HitlerKettle,"Well thanks my dude, cant wait for BSg to apply factory settings to all maps or figure some way to mess with draw distance or shaders for night raids"
