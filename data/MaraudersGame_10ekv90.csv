anarchy612,I really think they should add a kill cam so people can see how it really is. Cheating or not.
XFSpritz,Dude the devs just did a ban wave last week. Dozens of players in the top 100 were banned including squidy999. To say there aren't a lot of cheaters is ignorant.
ThrowTheCollegeAway,Yep. I'm quick peeking corners with the terminator and one tapping ppl and just know they're going to bitch about hacks.
PurePremium,"Same thing I posted not long ago. They exist, but few and far between.

terrencethetomato,"I walk through half the player base like they're ai and can easily out maneuver most of the players whose raw Gun skill outstrips mine, but the top 100 players sometimes feel like they're cheating because the skill ceiling you're mentioning. 

200+hours in and I have seen maybe 1 or two legitimate aim/wall cheaters. 

In a game with TTK so low it's really easy to not be able to figure out how someone killed you. Sometimes they've pinpointed your location because you aimed down sight too early, or crouched, or maybe they heard you tromping around before you even knew they existed."
Tiger20961,Honestly I'm 44 hours in and I know when I lose a legit gun battle just based on position and my failure to fall back and take cover or reroute to a better position hell sometimes I'm definitely not aggressive enough and that gets me killed
JWARRIOR1,"People over and under exaggerate the amount of cheating because they want to call it unfair when they die, or hate when people criticize a game.

The truth is there are a few cheaters here and there but to claim they are in every lobby or donâ€™t exist at all is just dumb"
Sunstone_KG,"yea.  
i get what you mean.  
currently top 400 with 100 hours.  
have the same stuff with 7, 5, 4 and 3 marauder kill games back to back, but i said the same with a guy with hamster in his name, just to check that he was top 30.  


man was constanty taunting, so he used it to make me peak him by making me know where he was, HS me and then hunt me down while i had 5HP.  


made more sense 2 mins later, than in the moment."
AFlyinDeer,Started playing again and on my third game I almost got killed by a speed hacker on the merchant ship. Even took a clip of it. So for me its 1 in 3 games but I most likely got unlucky
Intrepid-Fishing7732,"I have i think 40 hours of play time, never had any cheater or hacker. My mate and me died a lot in the beginning. We stopped sneaking and played more aggressive. Had maybe a 12 win streak with just changing the way of playing. Now we are stacked and almost never die. He goes with a shotgun and i go Rambo mode with the Lmg hipfire xD"
Prestigious_End_2436,The narcissism is this post is off the charts.
ALP1N3SN1P3r,"Same. Top 50 and skill gap is really high. I have 320+ hours and know all of the top ten in the world. If you think top 50 is good. 1v1 one of the top ten players. Youâ€™ll regret that thought real quick. Also something that makes people think there is a lot of cheating is the desync. Recently one of the my friends Iâ€™ve known since two wipes ago accused me of hacking because of desync. Luckily he was streaming and so was I so he looked back at my vod and apologized and realized that there are even fewer cheaters than he and we thought. Hit reg and desync is real in this game. Just not as noticeable as tarkov.

Edit: fixed typo"
Purist1638,Too say cheaters donâ€™t exist is ignorant. Ban waves keep flowing out.
bbeony540,"Yeah people dont want to hear that the reason they keep getting smoked is that theyre bad, not because the game is lousy with hackers. If more than 1% of player deaths were from hackers i would be astounded."
Mad1Pierrot,150 hours never seen a cheater
OverlordZombwich,"Ok, let's say the skill gap is higher. That skill gap needs to be closed in order to quit deterring new players.   


What are your suggestions in that regard?"
Mirelurk_Prime,"Agreed, except when I'm killed by someone glitched through a steel door or lying prone ðŸ¤£"
WiseGuye,Thank You!
WiseGuye,"I tell you one person who has aimbot. 



THE RED BARRON LOL!"
tehbearded1der,There are other ways to cheat besides using a software.
