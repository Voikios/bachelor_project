Lawmonger,"I think Republicans will be talking about people who are trans, drag queens, Hunter Biden's laptop, and CRT for a while."
liililllllliilillill,"I remember my parents would clap back with ‚Äúmore people are working than ever before!‚Äù when I critisized Trump. 

Wonder if they‚Äôre as excited about Biden‚Äôs job numbers that blow Trump‚Äôs out of the water"
bconley1,"Interesting that all you see in the news, including Washington post and nytimes, is headlines about tech layoffs. Which is a thing but the lazer focus on negative headlines gives the impression that everything is going to shit."
Metaledge56,BUt‚Ä¶ BuT... NoBoDy WaNtS tO WoRk AnYmOrE
OppositeDifference,"I likely have the job market Biden helped create to thank for my recent change in jobs.  8 months ago I was working at the same company I've been working for for 15 years getting underpaid for a job that kept having additional jobs rolled into it.  By the time I left, I was doing about 3 1/2 jobs.  They just kept eliminating positions and adding those responsibilities to my job with no additional pay.  

Now I'm working a job that pays 20k more, fully remote, amazing benefits, and a workload that feels like a never ending vacation to me in comparison.  Oh, and I just got promoted, got a raise, and a pretty nice bonus.  They're working hard to keep me happy because if I leave, they will now have a very hard time replacing me. 

That never would have happened if the job market hadn't shifted to the point that the employees actually have some power for a change."
Wasteland_Mystic,‚ÄúNow here is an expert to explain why such a low unemployment rate is not only bad for the economy but also an illegal impeachable offense for Joe Biden.‚Äù -Fox News
EddyBuddard,"I keep hearing, nobody wants to work anymore, from several of my friends.   I look around and point out to them that I sure see a lot of people working.  Admittedly, they also watch Fox News."
Cantora,I wonder if the title of this article was structured so ppl like me who are scrolling past stop to do a double take when they think they see the word blowjob
cmacias,"Cool, now do wages"
cigr,Conservative media has been screeching for the past week claiming that this report would show how horrible the economy was.  They were expecting record low job growth.
Vae-Victis390,"I'd like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that trump was literally the worst jobs president since the Great Depression. 

And that trump also said that if it happens on your watch, as president, you're responsible."
gidikh,Anyone else do a double take on that title?
Good-Expression-4433,"Conservative media has been screeching for the last couple weeks about how this report was going to prove how Democrats are incompetent, Biden sucks, whatever else. Now that the report says the opposite, we probably won't hear about it again. More air time for anti trans nonsense I guess."
nhavar,"My daughter is working a new job for over $20 an hour and that's great... except that what she used to rent for $900 a month two years ago they now want $1450 a month for today. Low unemployment, higher pay, are meaningless if everything else goes through the roof. We need to figure out how to keep housing prices from spiking like they have been. At the same time I feel like we're going to have a ton of investors and home buyers that bought over the past few years end up underwater when things settle down. That home they bought for 40k over the already high asking price is going to end up worth $100k less if we're not careful."
dfpratt09,Thanks Obama.
internetbrowser23,"Hmm thats strange, unemployment falls under a democratic president for the 5th or 6th time in several decades. Surely the public would notice this and finally recognize a pattern and make smarter choices?"
BstintheWst,"This is the economy that Republicans want to claim Biden and the Democrats ""ruined."" 

Record low unemployment and better-than-expected hiring as the inflation curve is flattening. 

If Democrats had the good sense to shit on the GOP for their lies, this could be a cudgel to wield against them. Unfortunately, the Dems are too afraid of their own shadow to attack the enemy."
fartlapse,It‚Äôs like democrats know how to do their job and republicans don‚Äôt.
lavardera,and they keep saying we are gonna have a recession....?
whizpig57,But but but I thought fox news said unemployment is at record highs
Slightly_Smaug,"I live in rural OK, jobs are not easy to find, especially if you cannot do hard labor."
I_Cut_Shows,NoOnE WaNtsTOwOrK
711and76,(Me working three jobs...)
SaltyLittleLich,"Now I just want to remind everyone, unemployment isn't a binary ""person A has or doesn't have a job"", but rather one person working 4 jobs to stay afloat and 3 homeless, unemployed people is also a 100% employment rate. 

When I hear how the majority in North America are living paycheck to paycheck, and I see homeless camps in every single city, I know what those numbers actually say. 

Employment stats should only show the percent of the population with at least one job, and a separate stat showing the average number of jobs people hold.  THAT would tell the story a lot more accurately than these feel-good reports."
Infamous-Berry,Unemployment rate is a bad indicator of the economy when the majority of jobs don‚Äôt pay enough to live on and people need multiple jobs to get by
LazyDynamite,Joe Biden did that.
thebeast_cr,Conservatives: ‚Äúwell‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre just lying‚Äù
thed0000d,Then why are so many people still fucking broke. Availability of jobs = / = increase in living standards for the average American
OooohHello,Weird over in conservative this news is being downvoted with no comments. Huh
edjg10,"‚ÄúUS reports blowjob growth‚Äù was why I stopped scrolling, aaaand back to scrolling"
MYQkb,"Quantity over quality.


Millions of jobs that do not pay enough to lift families from poverty.


Multiple jobs for each person, minimal time for a life/family/creativity. No real future."
ytk,"Lowest unemployment in decades and yet the blowhard co-founder of Home Depot is whina about people not wanting to work. I think it a case of not want to work for a shitbag operation that over expects and under compensates. A recent article indicates that food service is hurting for employees, maybe it's time to dump the ""tip-as-the-wage"" model and pay these workers an actual living wage as is done most of the rest of the world."
themagicalpanda,"if february CPI comes in at expectations or even cooler, then jpow may actually give us that soft landing. if not, then i expect jpow to be a lot more hawkish.

fed is also ramping up their QT as well which should help tame inflation."
FUMFVR,Republicans: 'I will never financially recover from this.'
cswain56,"Perfect time to start a union! Start contacting other unions, see what you can do to start one where you work!"
lumphinans,"And the stock market plunges... what's good for the general populace apparently is not good for the shareholders, or at least their dividends."
Randy_Bongson,Definitely read that as U.S. reports blowjob growth. Probably time to go to bed.
butonemike,Cool. Now do jobs per person
matt_1060,How‚Äôs this playing on the maga sub?
CheatingZubat,Yeah but I‚Äôm 1969 people could afford to fucking live.
Odious_Decible,"Naturally, republicants are upset about this."
CJDistasio,"I wish when they did these reports, that they would only report on jobs that meet the livable wage threshold for each state. The numbers would be a lot lower if they did."
nelovkiy,I misread that title
SPE825,bUt nO oNe wAnTs tO wOrK!
AceOfTheSwords,"Really tired of media touting U-3 unemployment statistics as the gold standard. We really should be looking at U-6 unemployment, which incidentally is up a percentage point or so from last month.

Not that increased unemployment is especially Biden's fault or decreased unemployment is especially to Biden's credit, either. If anything Congress has more to do with it."
Naytosan,"Well, there ya go! Jobs, jobs, jobs is done, done, done. What's the name of that guy who did it? Brandon? Blimpin? Bantin?"
InsomniaticWanderer,"""nobody wants to work anymore"""
Consistent-Wedding54,Joe Cool  üòé
jarvdslr,I hope this is true in some of the more red states. I have to move to Idaho sometime in the next 12-18 months and it would be nice to think I may be able to find some kind of work.
jeebee25,"If the Republicans had gotten the Red Wave they expected, they would be taking full credit for this. Now all they can do is try to distract from it."
McNuttyNutz,republicans FAKE NEWS
Ryan_22,"In Canada, the head of the central bank argued that low unemployment was actually a bad thing and that they need to increase unemployment...."
Cannial,Thanks Biden?
sampsbydon,"doesnt matter if the jobs are shit

pay your employees you greedy pieces of shit"
_awacz_,Interesting. Can't find a single article on foxnews.com regarding the matter.
TheBagman07,So do we get those ‚ÄúI did that‚Äù stickers or do they not wanna do that anymore?
the-hottest-of-damns,Get your high salaries my people! It‚Äôs finally a labor market!!!
mtheory007,"So, certainly that was not what most of us read the first time through the title, right?"
EverythingIsALie95,Everyone‚Äôs working but everyone‚Äôs broke!
ProlificPen,This all sounds great on the surface but I'd love to know how many of those people are working 2 or 3 jobs just to make ends meet. The article doesn't seem to mention that. I feel like knowing that number would paint a more complete picture.
jiango_fett,"Yeah, let's go Brandon! That's supposed to be an encouraging cheer right?"
DrBobSather,"The only area that increased was the service sector. Production, construction, manufacturing, everything else was flat. We might see an adjustment later this month. [https://www.bls.gov/ces/](https://www.bls.gov/ces/)"
TamsthePanda,"Now if those employees could actually pay their bills with said jobs, we can all be happy"
PretzelSamples,"I really hope one day people catch on that we seriously need ATLEAST 25 years of unified democratic government to get us back to ""America the great""."
Skyzfallin,But in 1969 they pay living wages
libraprincess2002," So interested bc so many people I know of and follow online are actively looking for jobs, applying to dozens a day, and not hearing back"
alternativegranny,"I'd like to see a  spreadsheet with details on pay per hour,how many hours per week and benefits for the ""new jobs."""
