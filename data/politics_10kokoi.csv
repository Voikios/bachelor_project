Scarlettail,Notably he represents Uvalde. His proposal would allow victims to sue state officials as well as police for their conduct. Obviously doesn't stand much chance in Texas but thought it was an interesting proposal.
thieh,"And I don't think it will even be brought to the floor for discussion in state house.  Not until most of the R state lawmakers are voted out of office, at least."
os_kaiserwilhelm,"I really hate this reporting.  There's like one paragraph of useful information,  and then drama between politicians for half the article.  

Under what circumstances would state agencies be liable? For what reason.  

What is the proposed standard of liability for police conduct? 

What is the proposed tax? Is it oppressive such that firearms become unreasonably expensive? 

The only thing that was given context was the suing manufacturers, which appears to be related to marketing towards children."
,[deleted]
InvisiblePhilosophy,"The state should absolutely be liable for negligence in executing the laws.

The Uvalde police diddling themselves outside is negligence at a minimum, and they should absolutely be held accountable for it.

That said, the population has voted for liberal (in the non political sense of the word) gun laws, so the state shouldn’t be able to be sued for those - the population voted for those laws."
Pillowtalk,Political theater with no chance to pass
shhalahr,"**Headline:**""Texas senator proposes gun laws…"" 

**Me:** Aw, shit. What now?

**Headline:** ""…allowing school shooting victims to sue state, impose firearms tax”

**Me:** What."
GT1man,He won't be a senator after the next election.
old-hand-2,"Totally rad dude. 



Do it."
cmhbob,"I don't understand how a state legislator thinks they can overturn a federal law (PLCAA).

I am, however, all in favor of any legislation that pokes holes in qualified immunity, which is a travesty."
insofarincogneato,"Sure sue the state, but a tax on firearms is a classist excuse to disarm only the folks you don't like. I'm sure that won't disproportionately effect minorites and vulnerable people at all."
pimpinassorlando,"Keeping guns out of the hands of the poor will reduce crime. We should also tax their right to free speech because they are usually uneducated and could spread misinformation. 

Or maybe we don't put a tax on constitutional rights."
schwanball,"Ah, so it’s just a financial problem?"
jsylvis,"Yet again, they're [ignoring things that might actually matter](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/27/stopping-mass-shooters-q-a-00035762?utm_source=pocket-newtab). No wonder this keeps happening."
ARealThiccBoi,This is going nowhere.
Neidan1,"Yeah, Target their money, cause that’s all they care about. If victims can sue officials for more than the gun lobbyists give them in campaign donations, maybe those officials would actually do something about the American gun epidemic."
_SCHULTZY_,If you can tax a gun you can tax a church. Start there.
Orbit86,Cool let’s do the exact same thing with drunk driving laws. The State allows alcohol to be sold knowing people will drink and drive. Let victims or families sue the makers of alcohol and the state for compensation.
UnluckyPlankton7786,"It’s crazy that the thought here is “let’s create laws that respond to school shootings, instead of prevent school shootings”. But then again these are the same people (meaning Uvalde) that helped vote Abbott back in office, so not surprising."
bordemstirs,Maybe a mass shooter tax will work as well. Fucking brilliant.
jonhon0,"If you are involuntarily involved or a bystander in a school shooting, you should be able to get free therapy for life."
E_PunnyMous,"If the government allows so much access to so much death, government needs to take additional responsibility for maintaining the general welfare. End of analysis."
leonzky,"Not sure about this, it would en up being the tax payer getting the bill."
mjbulmer83,Question. Will they allow victims of drunk drivers to sue alcohol makers or car manufacturers? Seems like a valid question
hashtags-and-popcorn,This is it! Make it unaffordable for the state to NOT act.
sugar_addict002,I good start would be requiring adequate insurance for keeping weapons in the house or car.
MagicalUnicornFart,"Texans are happy to be screwed over as long as the people doing it identify as “R.” They’re more than happy to sacrifice their children on the altar of the First Ammendent, even though they can’t read it."
Smart-Operation-7929,That will go over like a popcorn fart in church.
tacs97,Only when tax revenue is threatened will the laws change. Such a fucking scam.
KoreanThighLover,Imagine if we had a freedom of speech tax
FlexodusPrime,Paying taxes to own a gun?  So are we going to pay taxes for free speech and for women to vote?
Hot-Career-5669,Reddit doesn't think poor people should be allowed to defend themselves.
Ruin-Known77,I approve of this idea.
cuz78910,People will laugh at the hopeless optimism of such an absurd proposal. But they don't realize the point is to bring attention to the issue
ANARCHISTofGOODtaste,"I get suing Uvalde PD for their horrible response, but that's it. Taxing constitutional rights is an incredibly slippery sloap regardless of how you personally feel about them. 

We, the US, have been witnessing the rise of fascism with overt dictatorship overtones in our country. In my opinion, this isn't the time to start testing unconstitutional laws for political points. There are a hundred better things politicians need to focus on. They won't, though. It isn't about making things better, it's about pandering to the base to retain power."
apex_prariedog,This isnt a very good idea. Your just targeting good people in lew of criminals. Why is it easier to get guns into schools and not prisons.
idkwhatever6158755,It’ll never happen until god decides to drop another tree on Greg Abbott and every other soulless ghoul running my fair state but I like that these things are even being presented here.
DrGarbinsky,Shall not be infringed
sausage_ditka_bulls,I support this. This nations gun laws are political malpractice
Etherius,"“D -San Antonio”

Yeah this’ll never get broad support

Allowing victims to sue the state is good, but would likely result in unintended consequences 

Plus the government loves to argue it has no duty to protect people.  Check out the story of Joseph Lozito if you don’t believe me"
RowFabulous9091,"Important people would have to be directly effected by gun violence, probably multiple times, for anything to change. Gunned down, rich and important people like congress members, senators etc. are the only bodies that will bring change to our gun laws. 

Hundreds of children in schools or thousands of impoverished minorities every year are not important enough."
tabrizzi,"In a state that has made it far easier to own and carry guns than it is to vote, not going to pass."
GeebusNZ,"I've recently realized that unless there's a financial hit to wealthy or politically tied individuals, then mass shootings will continue. As long as the ""only"" thing that is lost is human lives, then nothing will change."
sirZofSwagger,As a gun owner. I think every gun should require insurance the way a car requires it.
Alternative-Flan2869,Finally some common sense legislation from this state. It will certainly fail.
Meodrome,Should be allowed to sue the GOP and the NRA.
Tarzan_OIC,Tax money from gun sales should go to mental healthcare
xXx_Bambi_xXx,">a tax on state gun sales

Infringement by regulatory costs. It's not unconstitutional because it doesn't *prevent* the gun sale but it makes it just that much more expensive and thereby restricts sales from those who could otherwise afford it.

It further doesn't apply to private sales, thus discouraging ownership of new weapons. As a gun owner who is deliberately paranoid that my gun will always fire on its own and that any used gun is unsafe, this is again a restriction.

That said, the only problem I actually have on this is it's evil devious manner of restricting sales to the richer among us. Because, for some reason, it's somehow reasonable to only let richer people own guns or something. IDK, I'm just a person who isn't rich and isn't a politician."
johnny2fives,"“bills that, if enacted, would empower survivors of school shootings to sue Texas state agencies, allow Texas law enforcement officials to be sued for their on-the-job conduct, create a permanent compensation fund for victims of school shootings by imposing a tax on state gun sales, and repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a federal law that shields gun sellers and manufacturers from liability.”

Typical democrat thinking, address the symptoms and hold everyone responsible except the ones who actually did it (the shooter, and his family if a minor, mental health agencies or retailers if they missed symptoms or didn’t do a full check), AND create unintended consequences where no one will want to be cops unless we pay for unlimited liability insurance for them, get taxpayers to paper over every problem with money, AND destroy US jobs and manufacturers. 

FOLLOWING THAT EXACT LINE OF LOGIC let’s ALSO allow DUI survivors to be able to sue auto and alcohol manufacturers, plus the state and federal governments, and let the survivors of crashes from idiots texting while driving sue auto and phone manufactures and the phone company and the person they were texting.

SAME EXACT LOGIC.

EXCEPT we ACTUALLY have the technology to practically eliminate BOTH of things if we wanted to, but lawmakers won’t make it happen because it doesn’t get them enough votes, OR big enough headlines vs the money that they would lose from those industries.

So tired of useless do nothing politicians who think we are all STUPID enough to fall for this idiocy."
Digisap,What about gun owners carry insurance and they get sued when they use their guns for violence or fail to report missing or stolen guns? Insurance companies compensate victims and families just like with auto accidents.
tundey_1,"If you haven't read the article, go read it. Look at the faces of the families of Uvalde victims. Families of 10-year old Lexi Rubio, 11-year old Uziyah Garcia and the parents of Jackie Cazares.  Families who have drawn into this misery through no action or fault of their own. Now think of all the little children in your life...you could be one of those families today. Tomorrow. If you have children in your life who are simply going to school, that could be you. Or me. On any given school day in America. 

Yes, this bill will likely fail to pass. But it is not mere political theater. For the sake of our country and our humanity, it better not be."
Kalkaline,"I don't think this will pass, and if it does pass it won't be able to stand up to a Supreme Court challenge.  I hope I'm wrong though.  2nd amendment rights have a cost, and those exercising their 2nd amendment rights should bear that cost.  Tax the ammo, tax the manufacturing of guns, tax the sale of guns, put those funds in a gun violence victim fund and research fund to decrease gun violence."
April_Fabb,How about the ability to sue politicians who accept donations from gun-right backers like the NRA? At least suggest this reform and then ask Cruz and his regressive associates what they think about this proposal.
ibblybibbly,Any taxes or fees for gun ownership only hurts poor people and makes it easier for the ruling class to continue to supress us.
snickerzz,Doomed
Icc0ld,Or we could look at gun laws to make it less likely that these lunatics get access to guns. But that’s a step too far for these sorts I guess
naked_as_a_jaybird,"I, for one, would like to thank all of the children for laying down their lives in support of our second amendment rights. There is no number of deaths, or piles of dead children so large, that could ever compare to the importance of our right to own guns...."
Sayasam,You cannot make a more American headline.
true-skeptic,So…taxpayers have to foot the penalties from lawsuits? Am I reading that correctly?
RevJonesHomemadesoda,"Crazy loony idea here... How about we try to fix our mental health industry! Cuz fun fact kiddos, we have a pretty crappy one. Many of these shooters Uvalde included where complained about for their behavior before the incident and NOTHING was done. Mental health in this country is shamed and seriously under staffed and under funded, not to mention that since Regan dismantled the institutional system (it was broke who needs to fix it right) we lack facilities. I know what some will say you cant make people get seen, but hey if its not readily available (right now you end up on a waiting list) you CAN NOT get seen anyway.."
santana2k,Let’s add liability insurance too.
No_Bumblebee_285,"Ah, so that the problem can be solved with money. The taxpayers money. More money for a terrible government. That’ll fix it."
BlueCollarBeagle,"Yup,  
The gun manufactures are in it for the money.  Time to use ""going after money"" to counter this."
bluelifesacrifice,Too many people make too much money from school shootings for us to ever do anything about it.
surpriseyoureanidiot,"Literally the only way to force private/public venues to impose security requirements. Guns are going nowhere. Make locations liable for gun violence, you’ll see upped security measures and deterrence levels increased."
PinkPanther333,"Here's the thing. This is the most complex social issue we have here in the US, and the cherry isn't even on top yet. 

Very soon, if we're not already there, large-scale illegal gun manufacturing hubs will be established, where quantity is king and serial numbers are emojis. It's also possible that a small network of facilities to be capable of producing large numbers of weapons for whoever antes up. The technology is ready and waiting for this eventuality and on a scale we haven't seen before. 

We must at least attempt to understand each layer of this mess apart from our beliefs and politics. We must be rational going forward to allow the ideas to meld together in the most effective way. And we need each other"
Losttravler-1975,So will they also allow folks to be able to sue auto makers if someone is killed in a hit and run or a someone use the car as weapon ? This is an attack on constitutional rights. Our rights are not to be taxed.
jillybeannn,It’s getting old seeing mass shootings happening everyday. Some days we have 2 a day. ‘Merica
sadandgladpp,Have them sue the NRA for further ruining the country.
StrengthDazzling8922,Should be sue Republican Party.
cromethus,"What a wonderful idea. Instead of instituting common sense gun laws that would prevent the vast majority of such tragedies, how about we just offer to replace their kids with a pile of money, simultaneously creating a new burden on the system and doing absolutely nothing to solve the problem."
rippit3,"This is the only way that effective gun laws will be enacted...so I say, go for it!"
was_and_wasnt,"While most of America would support these laws, republicans simply don't think that way.  More guns openly carried in every place and situation is their solution to our gun problems.  A good guy with a gun drops a bad guy with a gun.  That's their philosophy.  Making America one giant gun range with little protection from government or the law."
Free_Dimension1459,"Wait. They don’t even TAX guns? Some states even tax groceries and meds. 

Wow."
thened,What a world! Elementary school children needing to sue people!
HargroveBandit,Zero chance of anything even remotely related to this happening here.  Don't forget that Uvalde voted overwhelmingly for Abbott.  It's maddening.
EggplantGlittering90,Tax firearms like you do the middle class and state coffers will be full.
CJDoober,This is so awesome. If these fucking republican wack jobs won’t do anything about the guns then fuck em. Texas is about to lose a lot of money.
DenikaMae,"They shouldn't just be able to sue the state, they should be able to specifically sue the legislators that refuse to act."
Throbbing_Smarton,"**Firearms taxes are classist as fuck--and arguably racist, too!** America is a dangerous and violent place, [and lots of people living in shitty, crime-ridden areas need weapons to keep themselves from becoming further victimized](https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2022/10/13/1126878376/christian-lee-captures-black-gun-ownership-in-armed-doesnt-mean-dangerous). **There is *tremendous* privilege in being able to rely on the corrupt and ineffectual US police force keep you safe from the predators and criminals.** And for a lot of people--*especially* black Americans, though the risk exists for people of all skin colors--the question of  which is more hazardous (that is, calling the cops for ""help,"" or just attempting to deal with the criminals yourself) is a very real, very serious, very (potentially) lethal conundrum. FFS, do I really need to give a list of all the innocent people who have been fucking murdered by the police, at this point? 

**Further, taxes like this would do absolutely nothing to regulate firearms acquired on the black market--which most firearms used to commit crimes are.** Archetypal murdering pieces of shit like Kyle Rittenhouse often use ""legally purchased"" guns, sure...but *most firearm assaults and murders in the US aren't committed by archetypal murdering pieces of shit like Kyle Rittenhouse!* **Most gun violence in the US is, in fact, perpetrated by criminals *in the commission of another crime!*‎** Increasing taxes on firearms isn't going to help much there.

The reactionary laypersons who take to social media following a widely publicized shooting, proposing superficial firearms legislation almost universally miss the big picture, instead focusing on one specific element (i.e., ""mass shootings"") of the much larger, much more complex and, much more fucked-up problem of violence in the US. **We desperately need to take action, but they need to be actions that will *actually fucking do something* to stem the absolutey insane levels of violence that exist in this country,** instead of just making a bunch of privileged people *feel* safer. It's not at all unreasonable to think that increasing taxes on guns would likely just end up being just another security theater charade like the TSA--and only for those in the audience who enjoy a high(er) socioeconomic status.

Look; I, too, wish the world, and the problems in it were simple, and easy to understand and address...but, they're *just not.*"
Fabulously-humble,Raise taxes on firearms to pay the settlements.  And future settlements.
jim62,No. Talking about any kind of ban or tax makes people buy more guns. Give a tax break to people who do NOT own guns.

BrownEggs93,This is going to be met with the usual (and maybe some unusual) excuses why this should never happen.
marginwalker55,How citizens can’t already sue gun manufacturers is a travesty.

tonyinvegas,A Texan Senator advocates for gun insurance? So much for his career.
Erazerhead-5407,"It’s about the only way to get meaningful laws passed when the threat of affecting the purse strings of the state that condones inaction, plus gun manufacturers, and gun stores is threatened.
