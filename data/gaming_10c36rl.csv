johnsolomon,I'd rather fight a Golden Lionel with a Tree Branch
Heatcanonbolt,I was struggling before but thanks to this post I can finally collect them all. Thank you so much.
el_diablo_immortal,I did it. It's brutal. I missed 2 but had checked all of them off so I had to try match my map with an online map and find 2 missing out of 900. Absolute horror.
Nightsheade,"Ah yes excellent, I see the last Korok I need right there, somewhere in the middle. Gonna go grab it right now!"
getyourcheftogether,"You know what, funny enough, the last ~~Clorox~~ korok seed I collected was usually the first one people get. You know the one near the Temple of Time where you jump into the water in the ring of stones. I had a section off the entire map and go one by one to find out which one I had left behind"
lvl100loser,I‚Äôll never not love dropping the rock on their heads.
TheMykoMethod,"I havnt played Zelda... Is this genuinely the map of locations?

I've seen some wild collection challenges in my time but if this is real then it's definitely one of the most tedious!"
KenjiFox,"Fun fact, my mother spent a few years finding every last one of them without using any guide. She found the first half without using the sensor because she thought it was cheating. 

I figure she's one of only a few people in the world who has done this. Also, it was her first 3D game ever and she 100% it. She wore out many controllers and put somewhere near 8k hours last I saw into the game."
WhiteFox1992,"[To clarify, this is actually edited. There are no Korok seeds in the lost woods or in death mountain.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c5/ac/4b/c5ac4b4e1c8d5ae6045c81492581454c.jpg)"
PeskyAlien,Q u Q what even hurt more is I have 3 more left.... idk where
nohumanape,"I know this is a joke, but I there are still a lot of gamers out there who completely missunderstabd the function of Korok Seeds. They aren't intended to be a traditional collectable that players 100%. Sure, you can if you want. But their primary purpose is simply to function as a marker of intent from the developers to the players who want to explore. They are meant to make the giant open world feel intentional, because it's something that is largely missing from most open world games. It means that some seemingly out of the way location wasn't just randomly generated by an algorithm. That developer eyes graced that location."

Ninjewdi,Thank the goddess the reward for finding them all makes the journey worthwhile.
Logondo,"For completionists, this is pretty shitty. But for most people who play BOTW, it's not a big deal. It's kind of fun being able to constantly find more Korok seeds as you progress through the game.

I've probably put in over 100hrs in BOTW. Definitely haven't collected all the Korok Seeds. I haven't even completed every shrine."
fuzzymarth,"Using an interactive guide I collected not only every Korok Seed but every chest, except the bugged ones

And I still feel like I haven‚Äôt ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù the game because I didn‚Äôt do it again on Master mode"
Fafnir13,"I like collecting things, but I did not feel the need to hunt down all the korok seeds.  Getting all the shrines was enough for me.

Now my older sister?  She has collected all the korok seeds.  Three times.  Something's wrong with her."
r3tr0gam3r83,Thank you So much!! That one near the south-east has evaded me for years!
Jackalodeath,I love that this is gonna show up as a result when someone googles it now.
5pr173_,I rather collect all of the riddler trophies again.
D_Shepard,How do I get that one near the middle? I can't figure it out :(
minastepes,Really helpfull thank you !
unclenatron,"Is that you, Ubi?"
hazzman888,Perfect thank you
Majestic_Treat1326,Already found them all. You win a golden turd.
MooseDickDonkeyKong,"Thanks, I was missing three, but I got them now."
Benhurso,"Thanks for the tripophobia trigger, I hate it."
,"Such gameplay, wow"
Zealousideal-Ruin862,No funnier picture will be posted today. We have hit todays quota.
AduroTri,This triggered me.
InutileInfo,I‚Äôve found almost 300 so far. There‚Äôs still so many to find
BESTismCANNIBALISM,"I was looking for one in the bottom right for days , this helps ha"
IceBluePear,Thanks that really helped
Gamerfox505,Thank you Mr. Helpful
TheSusKingOfAngmar,"they need to add more, this is way too easy"
NappyTime5,I got them all. Does anyone know where Hestu is?
Hulkaiden,"Thank you, I've been looking for one but couldn't find it."
Duck5oup,This matches the shrine map someone sold me‚Ä¶oh no..
HiCracked,"Yeah, thats totally helpful"
ballsmigue,Is there a speedrun category of all korok seeds? That would both be the most interesting and brutal thing to watch.
Witty_Employ_2366,And this reminds me of how insane my wife is. Her first play through she got all of them and I still can't believe the has that level of commitment ü§£.
GentlmanSkeleton,Ya ha ha!
Onre405,Tremendous
arickmc1,This is only a slight exaggeration.
KnightofAzrael,They really couldn't think of a better collectathon?
Pink_Sky_,Old joke.
TunaTunaLeeks,It looks like someone threw a sack of sesame seeds at an open face peanut butter sandwich
AbzoluteZ3RO,I have the hardback guide and it says there's like 900 of em so this is actually probably legit
evan_720,The fact that getting all of these is nearly 3/4 of the in-game 100% completion is staggering
Vault_Survivor_08,And people complain about Ubisoft busytasks...
jack_pow,I never wanna see another korok seed again. I was using an online map and checking them off as I went along. Somehow missed 1. Had to go through all of them to find the missing one. The only time I‚Äôve ever thought to myself while gaming ‚Äúis this really worth it?‚Äù Managed to find the missing one‚Ä¶wasn‚Äôt worth it. üòë
boersc,r/terriblemaps
Krail,It is kinda interesting to see how even the distribution is. With just a few gaps and denser regions.
Car_Breeder,Why did i read Tears of the korok
AmogusCrazySex,Ain't no fucking way there are that much what the fuck I jist start playing for 20 hours and I only found like 12 seeds holy hell
PartisanDrinkTank,Yahaha!
54yroldHOTMOM,Thanks I was missing the one in the middle right 7th down and next to that odd looking korok seed. Thanks to this map I‚Äôve been able to locate it.
MarsHumanNotAlien197,Aww man! I was wanting to find them all myself! Now you‚Äôve gone and spoiled it uhg
Wingsnake,"""Ubisoft games have so many stupid collectibles""

BotW: ""Hold my beer"""
Machonacho7891,very helpful map thank you
z1kot,"You forgot one more korok seed at 44.89010997523909, 52.67161811748691"
Metalsonic642,Intentional or not this is the funniest thing I‚Äôve seen in this subreddit
Blaze202020,Ant no body got time for that I stop once I got enough for slots
Technical-Ad-5522,I hate games with shit like this. Then there's probably a trophy.... Avoid for me. I hate being a trophy hunter ahaha
SNES182,"Oh, look. This fucking joke again."
Wyketta,"This is 1 reason I disliked this game.

The shrines and this, it's just feels like a joke of a game, they put hundreds of duplicated stuff everywhere on the map, worst than ubisoft open world imho"
SergeantSchmidt,Ubisoft Breath of the Wild
naylsonsb,"I never understood the appeal of collectables. Like, do people go after these things because is fun? For completionist sake? Or just trying to make the money worth?"
lightningttt,This is why botw is trash its a 4 hour story with 1000 fetch quests and 200 3 minute mini puzzles
DKGamer312,"One thing that always bugged about BOTW is that it is full of fetch quests and collectible scavenger hunts the Korok seeds being the worst of any video game ever made, but other open worlds game always cop nothing but shit for having collectibles strewn throughout the world."
Midgitwarrior,"Honestly, this is just silly. Zelda great franchise I'm sure most would agree, but this... this is why I'm hesitant towards the sequal and alot of open world games. I want to get lost inside the world not look at a 900 seed checklist, and to think I quite enjoyed the main game mechanics."
trippypees,and there are those who say the game feels empty...
hamgar,Looks like Genshin but way too many freaking spots AND you have to pay for it.
triplebravo23,Stupid useless seeds
Destroyed_Bullet,Zelda totk?
Catcrazy27,BRHUU YET I HAVE ONLY BEAT 2 DIVINE BEASTS (unlocked 2 more) HELP

DrDufmanKnows,"Hahahaha, this is great"
Standard_Golf_1394,I was looking everywhere for this. So great!
sTo0z,Reminds me of the Crackdown orb map i painstakingly followed to 100% that game.
porklorneo,r/mapporn
DevilsLettuceTaster,Yeah‚Ä¶
pierogieman5,"Ah, thank you. Very helpful. I was having a bitch of a time finding that one 26 from the bottom and 35 across"
brucebanna34,Ahh yes the task so tedious I didn't even try. Did everything else In the game though. Masterpiece.
Hogberg179,Pretty satisfying to have them all collected tho
Franciz_,"Argh‚Ä¶ Now I feel so stupid. I missed one, and it‚Äôs right there!
Thanks though!"
Dkhda,thanks very useful
Thy_Art_Dead,"I remember  looking up ""korok seed locations"" a few years back and seeing this and being like O its gonna be like that is it!"
getyourcheftogether,Awesome thx
MrRabbit212,Ah yes it‚Äôs so clear now
Zohwithpie,Thanks
mggirard13,"What's worse is, from experience, you can collect all 900 seeds but still not have visited every named place in the game and so *still* not be at 100%."
Aesmachus,"Dude tysm, I missed the one at the top left."
kenneld,Anyone know how to find the 634th one? Having trouble with it.
Fusaah,Please say syke
Super-Robo,https://youtu.be/0y6-qekI6K8
ShiftlessGuardian94,I gave up collecting korok seeds after about 230 or so‚Ä¶my personal goal for collecting was about 441 seeds the exact amount needed to max out all inventory spaces
Duckin_,Fuck you and have a nice day
GriseldaBrick,#SKIN CRAWLING LIKE A MF
MistaMischief,I gave up. I fucking loved botw but the korok seeds could gobble my asshole. Shit was insane.
BigSal88,So thats where that last one is
_NightmareKingGrimm_,Omg thank you SOOO much for this. I can't believe that's the one I was missing.
StepMumSanta,Thanks so much OP! Was looking for that one towards the top right for ages.
Bitch_lasagna037,Wtf is this?
TheBigGalactis,The crazy thing is in my entire playthrough I only stumbled across enough for like 2 upgrades?
crofootn,This both made me laugh out loud and reminded me how much I disliked this particular Zelda game. I angrily finished it since I paid for it but my god it was tedious and annoying.
Darth-Regnos,I think you're missing one. East side
,"I was waiting for this, Thx !!"
SaltierStan,SPOILER!!!!!
Percival91,nice ty
Squallstrife89,Omg that's hilarious. Now they need individual labels and description on how to get each one in text that is too small to read
Ark14,Oh no the Skellige Island ptsd is coming back
Bipedal_Warlock,I‚Äôve always seen those symbols as the Italian hand gesture
HindsightingAss,"*inhale*

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"

Restlessannoyed,"I'm on my first playthrough and like, sometimes I just lift random rocks because like, you never know."
Naiflux,I knew I missed one. Thanks!
lg51543,Omfg thank you so much I've been needing a guide
Screbin,"Wait, is this real, lol. I know there's a lot. Also, is it only a completionist thing to do it? Or is it worth it?"
Actual-Trouble-2856,This is cringey lol
Lumpy_Visit9336,Thank you
sntcringe,Thanks man I finally got them all
-Batterskull-,"I gave up after 884. I‚Äôm not combing the entire map to find the 16 that I missed, especially not for a golden turd."
LightningMcMeme21,Korok seeds were the only thing I did not do in the game.
mantang1984,Thank you I was missing that one.
LargeTomato77,Spoilers!
nazeem132,I know know where to find the final 5000 korok seeds thanks
Greenfire32,There's only 899/900 seeds on this map
,Seems speedrunable
megamoo7,"Once you get them all if you actually want to 100% the game you have to discover every place. 

You have to visit a place that is named and have the name appear on the screen.  Which doesn't sound too hard. But checking the entire map for what you've discovered and what you haven't is a nightmare.

It took me hours before I realized the one missing was the eighth goddess statue that you have to take a picture of. Because I didn't get close enough it didn't come up on the screen so when checking I was like, yeah of course I've been there it was a quest. 

There really should be some sort of system to direct you to the missing %"
FearkTM,I have find enough!
Nocontext000,waffle house has found It's new host
Cosmonaut_Cockswing,"Ah, there is the one that I missed. Thanks."
NoBuilder9047,üéºgotta catch them allüé∂üé∂
rbarrett96,This is one 100% that I just grabbed a big fuck you to. Especially when you only need a third of those to fully upgrade everything you need to.
FluffMcBuff,Thanks I was missing one
mrfancysnail,"so helpful man, really saved my bacon there"
StarPenguin897,I'll fight a Lionel in real life than run for each of those korok seeds

golde62,What is this?
3vilMoW,"I wonder what massive, meaningless hunt Tears is going to give us."
DarkCreeper911,Thanks
Ph0n1k,"yep, done that."
Nimyron,I've never played the game but what do you get out of it ? Is there a reward for collecting them all ? Or are they used for currency of some kind ?
DroopyPlum,One of them is missing
Molbuntore,Helpful
Sir-Pinball_Wizard,"This image makes me so uncomfortable lmao, like genuinely grossed out üòÇ"
catgoesmeow22,Thx
T_raltixx,I thought this was Vampire Survivors.
Rin_Seven,Spoiler tag! Jeez...
BlackMageMinis,"What a boring collectible. Might as well collect cow turds. Most overrated game ive ever seen. 

And i still played it thru and liked it for the most part but what a slog. Same goes for ff7r."
bruckization,YA HA HAAA!
TheMazdaMiataMX-5,I recently started playing Breath of the wild for the first time and I don't really understand what these little hidden guys do? Like is it just a little easter egg or does one get something after finding them all?
hoodbobthugpants,This seems incredibly time consuming lol
censuur12,What a shite map.
somedave,My completionist tenancies were not nearly strong enough to attempt this.
sinime,*screams internally*
Zero_Burn,"At first when I found out what the reward was I was pissed at Nintendo for mocking the players who enjoyed the game enough to actually collect all of the seeds, but then I thought and remembered that Nintendo has a 60% policy when they make games, that 60% of the game should be easy enough where anyone who plays it can complete it and 60% is all you need to reach the credits. It's why you only need 70 out of 120 stars in Mario 64. Your reward in Mario 64 for getting all 120 stars is similarly underwhelming if you obsessed over getting everything, it's>! Yoshi and one last star!<, iirc."
RedMonk01,"Oh so there was one there, neat."
rlovelock,*That's* where the last one is!!
wizard_brandon,ah yes wow thanks. this is really helpful. i was struggling to find seed 579
Hunt_Nawn,"Ah ok, there's the missing 2 that I needed, you really helped me out man!"
Ghostkill221,Don't... It's just for fun
WhyYouYellinAtMeMate,"That's where the last one is. Thanks bro, I looked everywhere."
Marteicos,"""How many korok seeds exists in this game?""

""Yes."""
Xynrae,Thanks this'll help!
huey9k,"Dear God, how much fun at parties are you?"
Pixelpaint_Pashkow,you missed one
bitchlasagna_69_,I think 440 is enough for every need
bl4ckhunter,"And here i was, thinking the shrines were tedious enough."
KingDP77,I've already done this in master mode
inferna_copula,How long did it take to setup
Food_Library333,Oh there's the one I missed!
NiceLasers,Can‚Äôt tell if you missed one or if I counted wrong so I‚Äôve got to replay the game again
PsychoMouse,"Oh man, I was worried I was going to miss a few. Thanks!"
IngoingPrism,I did. Not worth it.
Soulsier,r/nope
Ordinary_Fact1,Thanks!  Now I can finally get that poo!
Dan-D-Lyon,One of the few things in video games I've never even considered attempting 100% at. And I used to have a pretty solid attempt at a living Pokedex going
spagbetti,This reminds me of those terrible maps for ESO when you needed to get those stupid books for leveling in the magic guild. ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a book somewhere in that entire mountain range‚Ä¶..yayyyyyy‚Äù
Verde300,Nah I'm good
