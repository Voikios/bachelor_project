Cochise-RFC,Looks awsome
daberok,OH HELL NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWW

MentallyDormant,I‚Äôm terrified bye
Pexd,"That‚Äôs very, very good"
smallshotfunshot,"Not in them biscuit baskets, gurl."
overkill_input_club,"Wow that's fucked up. I have questions.. 

How did you keep the nurse restrained while doing all that makeup?

Did you have to drug them?

Were they a friend who trusted you and didn't fight? 

How did you get them to pose like that? Was it because of all the drugs you had to use on them, and they just ended up that way? 


Ps: You shouldn't really make people do things for you like this as it may cause them to have ptsd. Especially nurses, they take care of us if we end up in the hospital! You may also get labeled by society because drugging people and keeping them against their will is frowned upon. 

Pss: nice cosplay! (And for some of you, this is satire)."
AnonymousP30,Yo this is pretty on point I like you in the game.
BC360X,"If they ever do another silent hill movie, I vote you play the nurse"

Seathing,I recently sprained my ankle and I'm doing an excellent silent hill nurse impression when I walk. If you want to master the stumble I recommend either breaking an ankle or learning to imitate the way you walk when you can't put weight on one foot

Zdog54,"I actually live right next to the town Centralia which what the silent Hill movies are based off of, a coal mine caught on fire and burned for several decades . Used to hang out there all the time when I was a teenager. All that was left back then was a long road in the woods that was covered in spray paint from start to end. Unfortunately during covid they literally got a bunch of dump trucks filled with dirt and completely covered the road to stop people from hanging out there to ""stop the spread of covid"", literally destroyed a piece of history."
a-halo-in-hello,That's amazing!!!
electrocyberend,Whats the face made of? It looks great btw
