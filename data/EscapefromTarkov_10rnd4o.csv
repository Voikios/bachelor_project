huzzaah,Find ai scav and make him follow me like a good little canary. He'll let me know whos a good boy and who isn't
wilck44,"so far I have met the factory ""munch-man""  twice.

he shouts stuff like ""the munch man is here! bring your food! a can and you are rich"" like some snake-oil salesman.

dude somehow always has good loot and trades fair for food. but only food, no drinks or money.  my best deal was 2 cans of peas for a tricked out mp7.

he is a fun guy."
Dead_Silent151,I had another scav come up to me the other day and ask me if I had heard of among us. He then whispered that he was the imposter and shot me in the face.
badass6,"I had scavs walk past pmcs and vice versa. Especially with the amount of newbs there. 

Other times there are five minutes left, you enter office and die to pmc. 

And other times you get killed by scavs as a scav."
PigasusGaming,"Factory and anytime there is an Airdrop, especially on Reserve.  
The amount of traitor scavs that try to 1v4 airdrop grabbers is so funny to me"
Interesting_Fan_4045,Ever heard of old Traitor in Terrorist Town?
TECHNOV1K1NG_tv,"Found a dude in factory next to death hallway, between the containers. I ran right by him because he had the press armor and a beanie, but as I ran by he took a shot. It was a fucking PMC pretending to be a scav with less than 10 minutes left in factory! He killed me but my buddy finished him 😂"
shortnamed,"I had a player scav ask me if I wanted to shoot him in the leg so he could kill me because he was supposedly very close to max fence karma. I said no.

Saw him do to the some other guy, who agreed. First thing he said after that ""i can't believe he bought it"""
ThatMuricanGuy,I have fun pretending to be an AI and just say OPACHKI in the deepest voice I can every once in a while. The reactions from other player scavs are always worth it.
Reasonable-Ad8862,"I spooked a guy and he shot me. He said sorry and I told him he better watch out for AI, not even a full second later I hear a shotgun and run to office and he’s layed out with an AI doing circles around him lmao"
Dlark121,just keep your head down and keep doing your tasks
Kanista17,"This would make such an amazing mod. People accusing each other over VoIP. Emergency meeting in the office.""I was doing tasks, fixed wires at forklift."""
HecklerK,"I scaved reserve and someone killed my friend in white bishop, so I went their and killed the wrong guy. we had a meeting with 4 other players scavs and I was sentenced to the airlock. I pleaded guilty but the sentance was death."
CALM_Oxygen,"I check the names of scavs killing me as scavs, they are usually single digit level and I add them to explain to them they shouldnt be killing other scavs - this is the most common scenario

I think that its just low level players confused who is a player and who is a scav

Most gunshots I hear are people extracting and shooting before they do which is weird to me"
GodChevy,Just last night I’m walking around scaving factory with another player scav and apparently tagilla has goons too now? Cuz we knew he was a around and we were both on the bridge and I see 3 juiced scavs all shuffling up the stairs staring right at me and him and they aimed at me and started firing and hitting me but not him he follows me all the way to bottom floor of offices and shoots me in the chest because he thought I was a traitor since Y’know I randomly started getting shot at and I had to put him down. Poor guy gave me .03 rep as a reward before the gaggle of ai scavs flooded into that room and deleted me
grrtbaow,amoma
imcheddarbeard,Trouble in Scav Town
NoooAccuracy,"I use to go to factory to scav for fast rep, now I just go to a different map like customs. Factory scavs will fuckin kill you in a second. If you keep going, try to leave ASAP or learn how to fight"
Princesse_LaStar,Hahah this is so true
DiscombobulatedSea83,I really apways try my luck and guess the traitor. Overall i got a positive Fence rep with this i think 😅
Scarity,[factory is the best map to scav and you can't change my mind](https://imgur.com/a/FQ5XTuv)
elitexero,"One of my favorite things to do is a PMC is hide in factory and strategically fire shots when a pscav is coming close to another pscav.  It's evil, but goddamn is it funny sometimes."
Forsaken_Decision_93,"I miss factory of old. Ah the days playing with the boys, losing kit after kit, when one says “Scav Fac 15”. Go Go Gremlins assemble. The ultimate warmup. Closest to death match Tarkov ever had. The sounds, both gunshots and screams of pain. Metal above. Glass below. Whispers of pilfered treasures wafting through the office ducting. The overlayed audio of your gameplay mixed with 4 discord streams as you desperately attempt to determine friend from foe. Before the days of voip, when F1 was pressed more than mouse2. This tradition of bloodlust has grown long forgotten by most, and those who participate today bear the unforgivable sigil of traitor. Branded by Fence himself, a stench so potent all other scavs immediately recognize it. The smell of a bad scav."
Upstairs_Reward,I stopped scavving factory. Only place I've encountered traitors this wipe and I don't want to risk my rep by misreading a Scav on scav fight.
messmaker007,"Holy shit I have a story about this one it’s my turn 

Okay so one day I was scavving on interchange and I saw another player scav (this is pre voip) and we immediately recognized each other as players and he started firing. I ran out into the middle by the escalators where a group of 4 scavs were strolling about so I kinda just stopped in the middle and started acting like a scav (step step step, turn, voice line, turn, step step step) he knew one of the 5 scavs was a player but he did not know which one. I watched him as he aimed at each and every one of us. He then turned to the scav in front of me aimed at his head and fired. The three remaining AI scavs simultaneously blasted THE FUCK out of him and I remember clutching my chest because I physically could not breathe after watching it unfold."
shrumis,📮
Standard_Ad_1383,"You cant shoot if you dont take dammage first or you are at risk, even if scavs shoots at someone he could not be a traitor if he only flesh dammaged an IA but didnt kill it. In this case it would be -0.1 

Play death near an IA its the saffest way"
openclosebracket,"it makes the game so much funner having VOIP in the game now, holy heck. also scav karma. factory was just vietnam condensed into a UFC octagon"
ZombieLobstar,Scav karma is the worst thing they added to the game.
Zumbah,Wait till you realize i was the imposter acting like an AI scav the whole time
FatBoyFear,I once killed three traitors in one single scav round. One guy that I now think shot me accidently and I reacted and than there was this duo who ran around shooting every scav they saw. Both revived instant karma when they shot one close to me 😆
DafaqYuDoin,That’s the best part of factory runs. Made a friend last night saving him from two evil scavs. We ran PMC’s the rest of the night.
JadenAUT,"**the penalty for killing other scavs is still too little. 0.1 rep is hardly a punishment** considering that you can easily kill other player scavs in night runs without having to fear that AI is effin you up. 

the amount of times i get shot in the back by some greedy ass mofo is skyrocketing this patch. especially on streets when you are looting cabinets....i have rather the times back where no rep existed at all and it was wild wild west, at least you knew what was going on and KOS'ed all scavs....

since AI scavs aren't actually following if you are ""too fast"" or the pathing isnt for for them the method to have one AI scav following is no to little protection at all....."
avowed,Ha this is NOTHING to what it once was before scav karma you would pretend to be an AI until you found out who the players were and kill them or avoid them.
Highway0311,"This is only somewhat related but, here goes. I was on streets yesterday and I heard shooting in Concordia. I figured a PMC was taking out scavs. So I hop on the Machine gun and wait. This player scav walks into the area looks at me and shoots. He misses. I mow him down with the Machine gun thinking he must be a bad scav. AI scavs destroy me. 

No idea why that dude shot at me."
8000roxas1234,"kek thats why you dont scav factory, bust it down on that streets/lighthouse grind"
CommonJob3852,So anyway I started blasting
TittieButt,"bind ""follow me"" to a f-key. bring an AI scav with you to sniff out naughty ones. before i had max karma, sometimes i would find dead bodies, then start shooting and running around all wild and sussy, to seem like a bad scav, but as soon as a white night came to the rescue, i would be +karma on them if i win the fight."
FriendlyBlanket,Scavved into factory and heard a PMC fighting scavs. I voiped to my fellow scavs to push the pmc. Run up the middle couch area to the skybridge to run into a fellow scav who promptly shot me in the face.
HeavyMetalHero,"The only reason to scav factory is to leave in ten seconds, anyway.  I'm not trying to interact with any of you worms-for-brain lunatics XD"
samwelches,Feels more like trouble in terrorist town
espkv,Shoot them both
ImNewHereAmigo,"Dude, this happened to me yesterday on Customs.  Two scavs jockeying, shooting at each other.  One looked at me, he looked super helpless, limping etc.  I killed the other guy, he thanked me and pulled security while I looted the other guy.  I saved the traitor……"
Big_Tomorrow5260,"This game is a grind, which 80% of the player base are grinding. A month in, youre pretty much left with the tarkov nerds... 3 months in, there is 0 hope for beginners. Its gonna be 35+ only most of the time"
fearlesskiller,Scav factory sucks there barely ever any pmc left
Coruscant_EO,I don't go to factory without my 5 stack anymore.
Gravitytr1,"For me its easy.

Scav karma >>>> any loot"
Prestigious-Ad-1126,You don’t wave your scav on a factory run mate..
NalaTheDoggo,Not SCAV on factory....
Jackpkmn,[I have a solution.](https://i.imgur.com/qNfKGue.gif)
JollyReading8565,"If you are trying to get karma, go kill traitors. I’d you are trying to get loot, check 1-2 spots then extract, keep time in raid to like 3-4 mins"
CKosono,"I just, since I care a little about karma, don’t scav factory. It’s either nothing so boring to me or dangerous and not worth the risk when there’s bigger reward elsewhere."
TryingToEscapeTarkov,I hear shots as I'm running to red light extract straight from spawn.
HeftyMark1039,This is the way
Aceylah,Only time I scav factory is a quick run to the exit for the .01 fence rep lol. Dunno why else you'd bother.
AppLeGReeN314,Yesterday I killed the bear in gate3 and the player Scav killed me in 1sec after… feeling sad to him about -0.1karma but at least I got my 0.03.
flanneluwu,"I tried to give someone an ah1  stim for samples but he just extracted so I found another scav and it took a bit to convince him he almost extracted too, he was really happy he didn't"
MysteriousWeird7126,Take the upvote. You are correct.
PM-ME-YOUR-TITS,"My general rule of thumb for these things is just ""mind my damn business"" or if I am keen to get involved I usually just shoot whoever is left standing. That's tarkov fer ya"
bmstrrrr,Exactly why I don't go to scav on Factory. Your survival chance has got to be a little lower than if you were to go quite literally any other map besides Lighthouse and Reserve. Reserve can get crazy as a scav too.
it1345,if you are always the one who betrayed it isn't that confusing
r3vb0ss,"Closer to ttt, accidentally went scorched earth bc there were shots everywhere and killed some Timmy who was sprinting to gate three to extract. Didn’t realize I was a traitor till end of raid. Although I’d also say it’s closer to TTT than among us"
squidelvis,Am0ngUs
BenoNZ,"Too many times I've killed a pmc, only for another scav to kill me because they assumed I was bad.."
JGfromtheNW,Definitely gotta play Tarkov Among Us. Dudes stay looking sus.
EnderNate124,"I was scavving on reserve one time and heard shots around k buildings. I went to investigate and saw a guy shooting at some other dudes, so i shot the guy shooting. He said he was a scav and was defending himself and I immediately regretted it. I tried to give him aid but he ended up bleeding out from my shot, and so I went to find the guys he was shooting at. I ended up getting shot by another player scav but when the summary screen showed up it said “traitor-scav kill.” Go figure, i guess ill take the free rep then lol"
Sea_Information_4012,"wipe them all, give the finger to fence. what are you? a beta to the freaking npc? F the system!"

Sworn_to_Ganondorf,"got shot by a dumbass player scav that didnt see the pmc I had cornered, oh well his karma lol"
