sdogbot,"His donor gimps did, you mean.

There's no way he paid for something out of his own pocket."
was_and_wasnt,"Trump gave zero dollars to charity in 2020.  instead, he gave 1 million dollars to the bogus Arizona election audit.  Once again, as we all know, trumps favorite charity is himself......"
User767676,"Also secretly didn’t donate his presidential salary to charity as he said he would.   

Edit: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tax-returns-dispute-white-231747455.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFUmxrLZ8d6sMkSwnvyZR5FQokHkUF-2ayKE6_ykhRyqa6B5TDQDagO-MjfkDTWhoLrG1MoVqNTwzx7_soPZZj6gSMOcUReaY936njwPZKY_HgpBjCqrEp0qEZprg9h_erj_58A824cTRIa6X1mabGpqvuW30fxQGW-4Q2A3DqAb"
NeoPstat,"Trump *paid* for something?

Fake news, surely."
joeydeviva,"For anyone confused by the nonsensical headline - obviously trump didn’t give money to anyone ever - the body explaons:

> An analysis by the watchdog group Documented has traced funding for the Arizona audit back to Trump’s Save America Pac. The group tracked the cash as it passed from Trump’s fund through an allied conservative group, and from there to a shell company which in turn handed the money to contractors and individuals involved in the Arizona audit."
ctguy54,He “paid” with other people’s money that he grifted from them.
KennyDROmega,Most shocking thing is that he paid someone for services rendered.
WhenTheDevilCome,"""Your Honor, it's not an issue, because I never intended to actually pay."""
craftandcurmudgeony,"nothing to see here, folks. just a bunch of grifters moving money around through a web of shell companies. totally normal aboveboard behavior. that he did not summon the Press Corp and make a big deal of this... uhm... ""donation""... is all you really need to know to figure out the intent here. it was payment for their efforts to stir up enough mud for him to declare himself 'king for life'."
Epistatious,Not sure I believe this.  Now if you said he promised to donate a million and left them hanging in the wind I'd totally believe it.
StillBurningInside,The “ cyber ninjas “ took this money and retired happily ever after.
TintedApostle,Let us take a moment to understand Trump had people do this for him.  He has help.
JakeyPurple,Just to find out that Biden actually got 150 more votes.
mettiusfufettius,The “Cyber-Ninjas” who were paid specifically to find anything and still couldn’t find a single substantial issue with the 2020 election in AZ. Lol what a joke.
jalapinyobidness,"Millions. Trump has lost millions - approaching tens of millions - trying to push the stolen election lie to reclaim political power. And the Dominion suit hasn’t hit him yet.

Paints a stark picture of how much money he must have MADE as president, and is a reminder that everything is a business, including politics."
vh1classicvapor,Another crime. Another shrug from the justice system.
Kurzilla,"I think it's funny that this was a secret at all.  Normal Trump would have been like ""I'm putting a Millleeeeeeeooooon Dollarhs towards getting this resolved.""

But I think the fact that it was *only* 1 million of the donated money making him keep it hush."
Hekili808,"""Donated""?  Maybe like ""husband donated to hitman who killed his wife."""
Protonbox22,Seditionists being tolerated is so fucking disgusting.
toddspremiumbacon,"Isn’t that just a bribe? Can we stop incorrectly labeling this stuff? I mean, how do I still see people calling the treasonous insurrection attempt just a protest or riot…"
Alyeanna,"""Donated"" - the word is BRIBED."
themengsk1761,"You mean the recount with the highly skilled ninjas (from Florida of course) who were literally scanning ballots for bamboo fibers from China? Yeah give them another million, see what they find."
AngelOfLight,"I've often wondered if Trump believes his own bullshit, and I have to say that it seems he does.

The first clue was the Ukraine call that led to his initial impeachment. He refers to Hillary's servers being in Ukraine. This was a RW/QAnon piece of bullshit dreamed up by people who were either deliberately stirring the pot or simply very, very dumb. Needless to say, Hillary's emails are not hiding out in Ukraine. But Trump swallowed that canard hook, line and sinker.

And now this. He probably earnestly believes that he was cheated out of the 2020 election. Despite the fact that basically every pollster predicted that he had very little chance of reelection, and the fact that he never broke 50% approval even once.

Trump is absolutely dumb enough to believe every QAnon conspiracy theory out there."
SuburbanHell,Revealed: Nothing he does gets him in 'trouble'
AnalSoapOpera,So basically you can just buy an election (which is what Citizens United also proved)
biskitheadburl,"Donated, LOL. Bribed, FIFY."
Ozymandias12,"Alternate title: Dark Money groups can easily move around donor money to fund bullshit. 

This is a textbook example of why we need to reform our campaign finance laws. Shit like this should be illegal."
manIDKbruh,"All this time I was giving him too much credit..always believing he was exploiting idiots who bought into the big lie, now we know he was one of the biggest marks in that fiasco"
The-Shattering-Light,The most surprising thing about that is that Trump actually gave money to someone else
extremekc,"Why is it that McCarthy has not created a commission on ""VOTER FRAUD""? Because 

1) they all know it is bs, and 

2) they can easily distract their followers with M&Ms."
Easy_Owl379,"So... The act of giving money or other assets with the purpose of influencing someone's opinion or decision in your favor is called a ""donation"" nowadays. Not bribing.... Right...."
Wryel,"I don't understand how it's even legal for private, or political groups to donate money to a state election investigation."
FilthyChangeup55,"Grifters looking out for one another, so sweet."
lilpune,Why aren't the Dems in the state leg. Calling for an investigation or proposing new laws against this bs? Didn't the republicans just exempt themselves from disclosing the records for this shit? Come on!
ClobetasolRelief,"Where the hell did that loser get that much money, from idiots supporting him politically?"
lowsparkedheels,"Wonder how much Kelli Ward, Karen Fann, et al, knew about this funding."
northeaster17,I also read somewhere that contractors are a bit upset because there haven't been paid for the work they've done. That's par for the course for old Donnie.
unrulYk,Cheating Cheater Cheats: More at 11
clodzor,"Spend a million to discredit, to get more donations to fight the corruption which he then pocketed."
Searchlights,"I don't believe this for a second.  It couldn't have been his own money.
  
Maybe it was money a charity raised for kids with cancer, or something.  But it wasn't his own money."
johnnycyberpunk,"> The group tracked the cash as it passed from Trump’s fund through an allied conservative group, and from there to a shell company which in turn handed the money to contractors and individuals involved in the Arizona audit.  
  
WTF?  
Why such movement with the funds?  
As I understand it there was nothing specifically *illegal* about the way the funds were obtained **or** spent, so why hide the origin?  
  
Using multiple layers of companies to move that much money is just... muscle memory for them?"
beans3710,"Trump Secretly Donates Someone Else's Money

There fixed your headline"
lacronicus,Feels weird to call it a donation when you stand to benefit directly from it.
oakstave,Trump is really bad with money.
Hentai_Yoshi,"Lol, revealed? 

Breaking news: Trump throws money at his problems!"
Tagurit298,"Frump is a scumbag, lying, con man, narcissistic asshole. Just like his followers."
Samuraistronaut,"This is awesome tbh, because I have no sympathy for the rubes he fleeced for the money, and I love that he wasted a milli on a fool's errand."
Schiffy94,Wasn't really discredited because it never had any credibility in the first place.
Kit0550,How the fuck is he still allowed to run for Presidency
stinkface369,Shit birds of a feather Randy
CharleyNobody,Donated other people’s money
DadinDenver,"Just when it seems it *couldn’t* get any slimier, it does."
kersed805,Dude wonders why he’s bankrupt all the time
DeviantKhan,It seems like the only time Trump pays anyone is when he's not supposed to.
Bits-N-Kibbles,How is this dude still walking around free. Our system is completely broken. Even Trump himself probably wonders how the hell he’s avoided consequences.
permalink_save,"This is illegal, right? An lame duck president directly paid a team of people to try and overthrow the election for him."
Fernway67,A cheater and a loser.
HopefullyMD_PhD,He didn’t donate shit. His degenerate rags did.
Common_Notice9742,That’s nice. I count the number of cans of beans I can purchase each week.
Salvia_McLovin,Again what's the point?  The right has deified this pig and will not hold him accountable and will obstruct any attempts to prosecute him for crimes.
Outrageous-Pause6317,Pretty sure it was never actually Trump’s money. Just fleece sheered from his foolish and malevolent followers and donors. As usual scratch his activities find a grift and a con.
DoctorPoopyPoo,"Nothing to see here folks. Just an autocrat trying to destabilize a 250-yo democracy. Move along, move along."
JustaRandomOldGuy,Is this the one that was looking for bamboo ballots?
rainbirdstew,the dirtbags that got rid of the last scrap of integrity to work on this clown's administration  will wear it like a stink for the rest of their lives.
MyWifeIsTheGreatest,Seriously-just fuck this guy already.  GD- I am so tired of hearing about this slob.  Is he gonna last until 100 years old? Damn.
Donkey_Kahn,He didn't pay for anything. He easily-duped supporters paid for it!
nojabroniesallowed,"As a REAL American, I find it appalling that this MF is still not behind bars."
LostBravo,Lol so that’s how he’s spending his NFT money lmao
Apprehensive_List365,Trump is a criminal and needs to be put in prison. What are the Democrats waiting for?
PigFarmer1,"Okay, but *whose* money was it?  It's not like he would use his own money."
Fuckmylife098,"Honestly Idgaf, they found more votes for Biden so he wasted 1 million to only give more votes to Biden. I think this is hilarious. What a small handed orange idiot."
newgreyarea,"*REVEALED: Old, white, suckers pay for orange, adult-baby’s sore-butt treatment. No cure in sight!"
rocafella888,"The fact that Trump used his gullible donors’ money to pay for this election audit is not a big surprise, but the investigative journalism and money trail-following done to produce this news article is top notch. This should be front page news in the US."
Gaudy_Tripod,"As much as I want this to be true, I am automatically suspicious when anyone says Trump pays anything."
PenguinJonas,I really hope he not going to be the next president. 😕
Brilliant-Swing4874,"It was not his money, the fools who gave him hundreds of millions should ask for their money back."
DirkDiggyBong,Who would've thunked that was partisan nonsense. Colour me so very surprised.
justforthearticles20,Money that he received through fraudulent fundraising practices.
MoneyTalks45,So he funded it
SMB73,"""Amazing financial genius"""
Tackleberry06,I’m sure it wasn’t HIS money he donated. Man is a cheap skate.
throwaway64677388,So he did donate his presidential earning 😂
yoyoJ,"It’s legitimately insane that this dude may be president again. If we thought last time we crazy, just imagine how much more bitter and spiteful this round will be. Last time we nearly lost our democracy. Can we even handle another go with this rodeo?"
GravityIsVerySerious,And watch that become a tax write off
FinalRhyme_76,He is a criminal always has been
TheThirteenthCylon,"On the plus side, he's draining the pocketbooks of his supporters and the RNC."
dudeonrails,I’m not buying it. Trump doesn’t buy a stamp without crying online about how unfair it is that he has to spend his own money.
tcn33,So much winning.
thatblbc,"I think that’s illegal but no big deal. He’s white and seemingly wealthy so I’m sure it’s ok. Right doj? The rest of us are just trying to survive but hey, what are jails for if not the poor?"
Strive--,"Sure, but he probably owns the entity to which the money was donated, took the tax write off and forgot the money ever existed on the other side.  Two local yokels were hired to sniff glue for 6 hours a day for a month and never got paid to do so."
forkies2,Is this legal? It seems like it would be illegal.
BenTramer,Trump is a piece of shit.
ilikesmoothies,Most shocking part of the headline is that Trump donated money
hwgl,"Let me fix that headline for you: ""Trump secretly donated $1 million of the money his cult followers donated to him, to discredit the Arizona election 'audit'""."
Kevinmc479,Big Fat tossing around the big bucks to cheat. In other news water is wet.
randomcanyon,"Whose money was it that he ""donated""?  He never spend a dime of his own, Just the donations from his cult sometimes."
lostacoshermanos,And republicans claim democrats love wasting money….
TrainsDontHunt,"Don't worry people, it was only Russian money..."
wretch5150,Isn't this the reason those fools donated?
frankdrachman,Where did Tubby the Traitor get a million bucks? Who’d he grift for that cash
ForgotToDieYoung,...and how'd that work out for him?
dhdhdjdj2,This is not…a scooby doo moment.
queso_teric,*Wasted. He wasted a million dollars.
newleafkratom,He'll be indicted for sure now. /s
,"Peculiar thing for a president to do, isn’t it?"
Ozzloh,I’m surprised he had that much money to give.
Big_Palpitation7095,Dude acts like a communist. The big con is still at it.
trai_dep,">**Funding for controversial review of state’s vote count in 2020 election can be traced to former president’s PAC**  
>  
>One of the enduring mysteries surrounding the chaotic attempts to overturn Donald Trump’s defeat in the 2020 presidential battle has been solved: who made a secret $1m donation to the controversial election “audit” in Arizona?  
>  
>The identity of one of the largest benefactors behind the discredited review of Arizona’s vote count has been shrouded in secrecy. Now the Guardian can reveal that the person who partially bankrolled the failed attempt to prove that the election was stolen from Trump was … Trump.

>An analysis by the watchdog group [Documented](https://documented.net) has traced funding for the Arizona audit back to Trump’s Save America PAC. The group tracked the cash as it passed from Trump’s fund through an allied conservative group, and from there to a shell company which in turn handed the money to contractors and individuals involved in the Arizona audit.  
>  
>Cyber Ninjas, the Florida-based company that led the Arizona audit, disclosed in 2021 that $5.7m of its budget came from several far-right groups invested in the “stop the steal” campaign to overturn Joe Biden’s presidential victory. It was later divulged that a further $1m had supported the audit from an account controlled by Cleta Mitchell, a Republican election lawyer who advised Trump as he plotted to subvert the 2020 election.  
>  
>But who gave the $1m to Mitchell? In September 2021, as Cyber Ninjas was preparing to deliver its findings, the New York Times reported that unnamed “officials” had denied that Trump had played any part in securing the funds.  
>  
>Republican leaders of the Arizona senate who asked Cyber Ninjas to carry out the audit also publicly denied that Trump was involved, saying “this absolutely has nothing to do with Trump”.

If Conservatives ever stopped lying, their lips would never move again."
ZaneTownsend,Hard to believe this based on Trump's unwillingness to pay for anything ever.
minester13,Damn trump isn’t winning anything but the big **L** time and time again
bodag,"We need to get a handle on all the polical money changing hands and just put an end to all of it. Limit total donations to $100 per individual citizen, per election....that’s it. Anything beyond that is forbidden and punishable.

No more super-pacs, no more fundraisers, no more insider trading or lobbyist deals or dark money. Let the candidates actions do the talking. 

This system has gotten out of control and needs to be fixed. How about demanding some integrity and credibility."
JamesVD315,"I really don't give a shit. It's just another drop in the bucket. 

Lock him up already. We all know he's a criminal. It's already shameful that we've waited this long."
Rufus_heychupacabra,He paid????
captainjackass28,Makes me wonder where he got the money from because you know he’s not gonna donate his own money when he can sit on it like a fat smaug.
Shadow_Bananas,So…he basically scammed himself? 😂
IvonVolkov,Do you kinda get the feeling that Trump is going to die of old age and never do any time for the many illegal things he's done?
HuckleSmothered,"Wait, someone got money out of Trump?"
lesChaps,"Not ***his*** $1m, really ..."
NikkiRocker,"No, Trump’s supporters donated $1M to discredited Arizona election ‘audit’."
grigsbie,"Where did his white-trash, broke ass even get $1m to donate secretly?"
RyoanJi,"""Secretly donated""? Did you mean bribed a company that was supposed to be independent so that it produces the desired result?"
Biomicrite,"Hang on, he fabricated a lie and then funnelled $1M to prove…. it was a lie?"
RaycharlesN,"In all fairness it was donated money, so maga passed the hat around"
pickypawz,Wasn’t that…money laundering?
Geeber_The_Drooler,"""Donated"" ... what a quaint word for ""payoffs""."
GOPGUNLUv,How much did Trump donate for adoption services or women’s health? Enquiring minds want to know!
Sargent_Sarkasmo,"Well, it's probably more with the money of the scam he's been running than with his own."
Howitworks4me,"I mean—- the pic looks out of context. He’s not really a white supremacist, err a right? 😬"
Comfortable-Wrap-723,He collected 220 millions from donations.
canon12,The fines that he has been ordered to pay were way too small.
Godofwar-2,Who cares? Nothing will happen and Trump will go on to golf another day. Why even bother as Trump is untouchable and nothing he does will lead him into real trouble.
drukweyr,Another potentially illegal act that will have no consequences. Add it to the pile.
Radish_Hour,You spelled Putin wrong….
belly_bell,Trump had $1M to donate?
Bambi_One_Eye,"The people that need to see this won't, and if they did, would likely not care.

And here we are."
outinleft,I guarantee it was somebody else's money...
ConditionYellow,"Oh, look, another reprehensible thing Trump has done and will suffer no real consequences for.  🤷‍♂️"
James_Vowles,All this stuff coming out and he won't see jail. Broken system.
Mbaker1201,… and nothing will happen.
GrandBed,"No surprise. Trump crime #23,413"
MoreReputation8908,"Up front? I’m surprised it wasn’t “do this audit for free, and ‘if’ you ‘find’ that I actually won, there’s a million (in donor money) for each of you in it.” (Followed by him not paying anyone.)

He must be slipping."
OldAssHat,[We got him!](https://media.tenor.com/BKk0-I2aA78AAAAd/we-got.gif)
Politicsboringagain,"North parties are the same, there is no difference between Biden and Trump, there is no reason to vote for democrats, vote for X third party candidate so they can get 5% of the vote.

Or some bullshit."
I_try_compute,Wow what a reveal too bad it doesn’t fuckin matter and nothing will happen.
AtomicBlastCandy,Watch is that there is a some rule that something like 5% of money contributed for a cause has to be directly sent to fund that cause. So $1M might be only a small fraction of his grifting.
SirLavish,Like it was his money to begin with...lmao!
BarryZZZ,...and the check didn't bounce?
mytb38,"That was a $1m investment in an effort to seal America's Democracy and unlimited amounts of money, if successful we will be using money picturing Trumps’ & Pissed Blond hair!"

randym940,Just another bAd investment by a guy who claims to be smart lol 😂
Rosanna44,Who’s money?
meatsmoothie82,Remember “I could shoot someone on 5th ave and my voters wouldn’t care”? Still applies and also applies to the DOJ and all his loyal followers in Congress.
BluEyesWhitPrivilege,That's it?  He really is stingy.
baeb66,"The only surprising thing here is that he didn't promise the Cyber Ninjas the money, let them do the work and then skip out on the bill."
Sorrow_cutter,More than 750!!
Gabaghoulz,"Yet another bad investment, shockingly"
InfiniteDimensions,Based
CharToll,How much did he spend on the Jan. 6 people he gained all that money from by singing their praises or demanding they be treated like patriots? Has he even spent ONE penny on their legal fees?
Seahawks1991,Is it legal for Trump to have donated to the audit?
Shadeun,I dont believe that Trump gave money to any cause - even if it tangentially benefited himself.
sync-centre,Sounds fake. I would never believe Trump donating anything. /s
Kittydander503,How did that work out?
Substantial_Sun_8477,"I, too, am launching an audit. I, too, would like him to donate to me."
Lavatis,"Yeah right, this bastard doesn't have 100k to spend on that, let alone a million dollars."
Loreki,Whose $1m? We know he doesn't have that kind of cash.
brett_riverboat,Holy shit! Trump gave away money???
sprintabm,"As old as he is you would think he’d know that there’s no such things as secrets if you involve even one party to it. There’s a secret and what is simply not known today and will be divulged at a later date, generally when it’s of more value to someone else."
DrakeBurroughs,Shocked. Shocked I say.
digital_dagger,1m < 1M
FilthyChangeup55,Trump secretly donated to Kari Lake?
IEATMOUSETURDS,Of our money

Hot_Eggplant_1306,He has to fund his own support system lol
heresmytwopence,I. Am. So. Surprised.
xDarkhorse,How is that not a corrupt act?
BankshotMcG,"Here it is, history's only known instance of this shithead spending his own money, and it's to subvert democracy."
MC-Fatigued,Was this even in question?
VolvoFlexer,Well of course he did
bearpoopfoot,Waste that money.
DrKramerTheAssMan,Only a small loan
mcqueen0001,"Lol, “secretly”."
Illustrious-Yam-3718,"So like, at what point does he get personally charged with felonies & go to jail? And not the Trump Organization having to pay fines?

I see headlines where he’s caught doing illegal things, and everyone is like “classic donnie lol”."
penny-wise,No way! And I’m sure he will be punished to the fullest extent of the law!
2OneZebra,He did a lot more than just donate cash I'm sure
Calico_Cuttlefish,Wake me up when something is done about it.
SomeNoteToMyself,Jesus
win32ce,"No expert, no right to post here. But from what I think I remwmber, that Arizona investigation actually admitted they didn't find anything, didn't they? They were clearly hired to find a stolen election at any cost, and they were relatively honest. I thought that was brave under the circumstances"
