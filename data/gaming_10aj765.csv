Dreaming_Kitsune,The only annoying thing is my gun has a conscious and won't let me murder hobo my way through the game
theopinionateddude,"If you haven't bought the game already, you're in luck. Steep discounts are on their way!"
Milla4Prez66,"I loved this game, but Roiland’s humor aint for everyone."
Cunnymaxx14,That's unfortunate timing to have posted this just an hour ago
,[removed]
TehRiddles,"That option only affects the guns though, not the length of all other monologues in the game."
XxboofmasterxX,"great game, but for $30. 60 was high to pay for a quick campaign

edit: stop commenting “game pass”"
Hera_the_otter,Still gonna complain the Justin Roiland is a one-trick-pony when it comes to characters and voice acting.
Leramar89,"As someone who likes Rick & Morty even I was getting sick of it by the end.

I enjoyed the game for the most part, but anyone who doesn't like Justin Roiland's style of comedy would not like this game. With or without gun chatter. And that's perfectly fine."
Nydius77,"The game isn't annoying just because of the gun dialog, it's annoying because it's the same, tired, one-trick-pony humor Justin Roiland has been peddling since the premier of Rick and Morty. The gameplay itself is barebones, reminiscent of early-to-mid 2000's low budget shooters that did the barest minimum to be a viable product.

The humor is the only thing the game has going for it, and if it doesn't click with you, or you're tired of the Rick & Morty style dialog  (as is my case), then it's just not a very good game."
dondieselcakes,Is this PR damage control?
theatrekid0309,"You do know this was added *after* launch, in response to said critics? Who's really the idiot here?"
wxlluigi,is that not the point of the game though? that it's a waaaackyyy craaazyyyy fps with roiland jokes? does removing the voices not hugely impact the experience
ElTralle,"""Someone has a different opinion than me. They must be an idiot."" - OP probably"
Erbodyloveserbody,People can have opinions on what they do and do not like. Being in latter does not make them “idiots”.
TheNashyBoy,"Just because you can turn it off, doesn't mean that there isn't too much of it or that isn't annoying. It ain't invalid criticism just because you disagree with it."
StupidestGuyNominee,"When you take the humor away, all you're left with is a pretty mid first person shooter.

Also doesn't address that the dialogue is still annoying on the story sections, which you can turn off."
yace987,So much lobbying on this game on reddit.
DivorceSpeedrunner,The highest tier of copium
PhasmaFelis,"Sure, but the dialogue is the main draw, right? I haven't heard anyone saying it's got deep, innovative gameplay. If you drop most of the dialogue, how much is left for it to offer?"
dopepope1999,How dare somebody have an opinion on something subjective like humor
LogicalDelivery_,The game sure isn't great
Necric,A game whos main focus is its dialogue and cast has talkative characters. Who could have guessed
Cerberus-Coco-Mimi,well did you disprove the gun is annoying?
Xynjak,If the game has to have a menu to stop the characters talking so much that kinda says something imo
Habit8902,Lol the reviews are correct. The game is overhyped trash
Alcatraz_46733,The game is mediocre at best. The humor sometimes works but mostly is just annoying. It's not the worse thing ever but it's differently not awesome. It's a mid game with okay humor.
platfus118,"I'd really like the idea if the dialogue actually had purpose and was funny. When I play a game I don't want to deactivate features. I want to see the intended experience. And the intended experience is so ear-assaulting that I just stopped playing the game. Also, the gameplay is subpar, that's probably more it.

You should really work on your outlook if you think people criticizing this game for whatever reason are idiots."
unpersons505,"There isn't too much annoying dialogue coming from the guns, there's too much annoying dialogue coming from *everyting*. Guns, turnstiles, your suit, the carebear ewoks, the cum salesman, the hobo living on your couch arguing with your sister cause she wants to fuck an alien. And none of it is skippable. No, I do not fucking care if she goes out and fucks a 10,000 eyed tentacle alien because I don't give a shit about her. She's basically S1 Summer except there's only been like 15 minutes of interaction with her and none of it was meaningful. And really, every character is basically just a rip from Rick and Morty or Solar Opposites. It's like watching the most mediocre episodes of those back to back on repeat and once every 3-6 watch there's a new (not necessarily good) joke slipped in. The gun play doesn't exactly carry the game if the ""humor"" falls flat to you either."
Excellent_Routine589,"But by shutting it off… you now only highlight or bring to the forefront how painfully average/below average a shooter this game is. 

[Painful enough for me to beat my girlfriend in October 2020; EDIT: It was May 2020](https://ew.com/celebrity/rick-and-morty-creator-justin-roiland-felony-domestic-violence-charges/)"
Confusedandreticent,"The most interesting thing about the game is the dialogue, until it isn’t. Then it kinda falls flat. Reminded me of games from 20 years ago, but with better graphics. I know people will say, “I loved games from 20 years ago!”, go play one. They just seem a bit hollow now."
amnesiakkss,"Have never watched a single episode of Rick and Morty. That said, I think the game is good, but it's held back by two specific things.  

1. The first gun you get. I didn't know I could find someones voice so annoying. Granted I never got to grabbing the second gun, so who knows. It really is insufferable, though. But that brings me to the second issue.  

2. The shooting. If this game was a platformer with puzzle elements to traverse, I very likely would not have dropped it. The combat, which let's be honest, is the majority of the game, is just so bad. And there's just so much of it. Any moment I got to explore the small sample size of the world that was shown to me was interesting, fun, the characters all around enjoyable. It took about 45 minutes for me to tire of the combat scenarios, to the point where I would audibly sigh each time one begun.  

I rescued the forest bears, grabbed the teleporter from the cokefiend, returned to the bears, and I could tell an action scene was going to start very soon. I didn't let it get to that point. Very unfortunate, but it is what it is. Thanks Game Pass."
Et_Crudites,Plus the creator is awaiting trial on felony domestic violence charges.
Sgorilla,Oh I just think the shooting and gunplay are super flat and dull. Glad I got to try it via game pass tho
GiraffesAndGin,"People don't think the dialogue is annoying because it spits out directions, people think it's annoying because they don't find that humor particularly funny.  I sat down to play the game at my buddy's house and I made it about 20 minutes before I walked away and said, ""Yeah, this just isn't for me."" Some people enjoy that aspect, some don't. And since that is basically what sets the game apart from any other shoot em up game it's going to be hard to want to continue playing if you don't like it. 

Just let people like or not like things. They aren't idiots because they don't like a game you like, they're just people with their own tastes. For example, just because someone likes CoD while someone else prefers Halo doesn't make either of their choices better than the other, it just makes them different. Enjoy what you want to enjoy, and let others do the same."
FrankieMcGigglefits,"PSA: even with the dialog turned down its too much. 

Even with zero dialog the game is extremely mediocre and dull. It's a novelty like a chocotaco. Something you crave once every decade but then taste and you're done with it. The graphics are nice to a point. But that's it. Missions are awful and short. Game play is extremely easy, and I say that with arthritis at age 50. 

No replay value. 

It's like listening to Rick and morty while going pewpewpew. That's it. 

Calling people that don't enjoy the banter idiots, doesn't that violate a rule of the sub for hostility just in the title? What a fucking moron."
KingMidas2045,"I mean, when the game literally tells you that you can turn off the selling point of the game... You start to wonder if the selling point is worth it."
batm123,"To each their own, but Roiland is not funny imo"
singh853,"We don’t have to call people idiots because they don’t like the dialogue in a video game. Rick and Morty style humour is already divisive as it is.

Let’s be better than that."
KameronDarkwood,That was patched in AFTER people complained. Still a shit game though.
ButtChugJackDaniels,It's not a game it's a glorified walking simulator but it's funny I'll give it that. Game is way too overhyped though. If you don't like the improvisational style Rick and morty humor there is almost nothing of value to this game. Way too easy and short with virtually zero replayability. I'm expecting WAY more content from the sequel otherwise I won't bother with it.
Kyuojin,"okay, but it doesn't save the fact most of the humor isn't actually that good."
lazerweasl,"I haven't played but am I the only one who think the constant stammering is kinda annoying. It there style of dialogue, I know I just don't like it to much"
JhonLemon1334,"That's cool, by the way the creator of this game has been charged with domestic violence and felony!"
cyborgborg777,I mean that's cool but it does change the reddit tier humor this game runs on
TheFutur3,I just don't like the product placement. I prefer to not be advertised to while playing a game.
SinisterCryptid,"Dialogue and writing are just as important to the game as the gameplay. Even if the game is fun, I don’t want to keep hearing unfunny jokes in an annoying voice constantly. It ruins the fun and makes me want to play something else"
HiiiighAllTheTiiiime,I just don't like the game. It's unfunny and boring imo
HiImRob2,Don't listen to other people's valid complaints about a game? OK..  weird.
niiima,"I really tried my best to like this game, but its gameplay was so damn boring and its combat too repetitive that I gave up after playing half of it."
i_broke_wahoos_leg,If you're not into the humour it really isn't anything special...
Mental5tate,Game is great if you like the humor in Rick in Morty but some might find it annoying and obnoxious…
In0nsistentGentleman,Then you run into the issue of potentially missing out on jokes just because you don't want to hear Morty's voice for hours on end.  I don't see what's so hard about just not doing Morty's voice in every piece of media.
ArmpitPutty,Wonder how much this ad cost
mikephoto1,Naa this game is definitely bad. The only good bit about it is the talking. The core game play is so poor.
Tribalchief_Mahan,Oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man oh jeez oh man
Newguyiswinning_,Who tf listens to games journalist reviews anymore?
Wide_Sell4159,"Hey you person that doesn’t like something that’s clearly something that differs from person to person, your wrong in not liking that thing because I like it.

Fucking grow up, people are allowed have their own opinions."
DollarSuperComputer,"3 day old account sucking off justin roiland's game right after all the allegations about him come out, not suspicious at all"
mech_man_86,I've just heard that it isn't a very good shooter and isn't very funny. I think most people know about the dialog options so that's a bit of a straw man.
dtorre,The game is a 6/10. I just binged it. It had some laughs and cool guns... But 75% of the way through it got VERY stale.
m_garlic87,The game is fun but there’s been a few times where I’ve been like “just stfu already”
Buuhhu,"they are not objectively wrong, humor is not objectively good or bad, so if their problem with the game is the jokes, which in this case is a huge part of the game, them giving it a bad review is completely fine.

some people like the small little jokes others find them cringey or just not funny. personally i like them."
Sentsuizan,"The game is just annoying in general
B tier humor"
BodybuildingNerd,"Fun Fact: Justin is due in court in the next 30 days from a 2020 Domestic Violence charge, along with another felony charge. He took a plea deal and was also required to turn in all firearms he owned. 

Makes sense why Rick n Morty went to shit after Season 3 and this game was also lackluster."
Boikilljoi,"I beat it and I loved it, but it had some annoying parts for sure."
ChronicOption98-OG,Too bad Roiland is a piece of abusive trash! Fuck this game!
Jaksimus,"They're not idiots, this just wasn't an option at launch."
Therealvahl,I don’t care I just fucking hate Justin Roiland
Swordbreaker925,"It looks like an interesting game, and I don't mind the very talkative gun, but I cannot get over that annoying Morty voice.

Yes, i know it's the same guy who voice acts for Morty, but I have always hated that voice and it's why I can't stand that show. It's whiny and grating and I can't go 10 minutes without shutting it off."
jcwkings,I hated the humor and thought the shooting was mediocre and unsatisfying.
Azenar01,If the main gimmick of the game is the talking weapons and you need a slider to change how frequently they talked then you weren't confident that it was a good idea. Why would you play the game with no talking weapons? You might as well go play Metroid Prime instead then
HussingtonHat,"Tbh if you don't like Roilands humour your not gonna like it.

But I needed to keep the guns n shit talking just to make it unique. You try turning off the background chatter, I dare you. You'll suddenly be struck with a fairly mediocre shooter that doesn't have a great deal of ideas. The dialogue is the main draw really. Half the game is hanging about waiting for dialogue to be exhausted."
mohmar2010,"Nah the amount of dialogue just at the intro itself kinda killed my vibe to ever play it again

No game ever made me wanna rip off my ears as much as this game, which is unfortunate

Somehow made my head hurt, ill probably replay it down the line or just watch someone play it instead"
MaximumCatastrophe,But isn't the whole point of the game the dialogue from the weapons? Without it you're left with an subpar FPS.
Ding_dong_banu,"Yeah this post launch feature that removes one of the focal points of the game, the dialogue, from everything but the cutscenes (which are still terrible) is genius. It also fixes the boring, milquetoast gameplay!"
,Adding in a setting so people can get less game than what they paid for JUST to have a better time with it either means the game or it’s mechanic is shit. Forspoken has the same issue with banter for your cuff and it’s like why even bother programming it or having it in the game if you have a setting to remove it? Just take it out lol
JackOLanternYoYo,bro thinks he the messiah because he followed the tutorial
the_pope_gay,the game is bad and not funny bro
Mike__Z,The blue gun will beat your wife if you turn the setting down.
haleysnake,This game is fun in smaller intervals. The jokes and humor packed into the game are just sooo dense and after awhile it’s overstimulating. But in 1-2 hr long segments this game is insanely entertaining.
DarkxXxValkyrie,"It’s not that the guns talked too much, everything they said was annoying. The writing was all terrible. The only joke that made me laugh was after the first boss and that was it, everything else was either annoying, dumb, or cringe."
SmellsLikeCatPiss,Do they have an option to turn off all the bugs too? Or one to make the gameplay more exciting? Or make the game longer?
eightmag,"It's not a great game tho. The game is boring as hell. 
The only thing making it interesting is the dialogue. 
And yeah , it's not funny laugh out loud. It's more , huh what insane thing will they say next , that they think will be funny.  It should have been less a shooter and more of something else."
mcadams226,"God forbid a developer make a game that’s genuinely unique and different compared to all of the copy/paste yearly releases or “*insert here*-like” games these days.

The game is phenomenal. It’s hilarious and even if it is a pretty linear “FPS”, you can tell the devs cared about what they were making, not just how many copies they could sell. If that were the case, they wouldn’t have put it out on Game Pass day 1."
BodySurfDan,"This game is absolutely amazing. I find myself getting lost in the content like the mystery science theatre, the random TV shows, the side dialogue, etc. The commercials that play on the tvs feel like interdimendional cable and the comedy style is perfection lol."
LottieThottie-,"It’s not the frequency of dialogue, it’s that the humor is ass."
GhostDude49,"The talking guns were the entire selling point of this game, and I'm 90% sure that pop-up was patched in after launch. And awesome? Even with the dialogue turned down, the guns talk alot and it's just Justin Roiland humour, which is not God's gift to humanity and not everyone likes it."
Own_Pirate_3281,"If you don't like the jokes, just don't listen to them!

If you don't like the movie, just close your eyes while you're watching it!

/s"
ahlgreenz,"If a person likes the game (saying a person here, because seeing as your account is 3 days old, I assume you're just karma farming and not really behind your own argument), then all the power to them. If a person doesn't like the game for whatever reason, they're free to. That doesn't make them idiots. That's a terrible outlook to have."
FlameShadow0,"My issue was with the gameplay. The only thing the game has going for it is it’s funny. The gameplay is so boring, it’s just a regular shooter"
kurokitsune91,Wasn't that actually added in an update like a week after release?
Rs-Travis,Based on the comments I'm seeing here. Maybe I enjoyed the hell out of this game because I've never seen Rick and Morty so this is my first 'thing' with this humor.
HentaiOtaku,I think dark souls taught us all that reviewers don't actually know how to play the games they review.
Dramatic-Citron8612,What is everyone's favorite gaming convention?
crzyinjun,My only issue with the game is that the talking gun keeps trying to domestic violence me and then tells me it's my fault it's doing it.
Flawd01,found the high on life dev's burner
tunaburn,I found the actual gameplay to feel really bad. The shooting didn't feel good to me.
Slim_cognito7861,Game is garbage
Odysseus1776,"I love the ""nooooo stop trying to kill everyone"" when trying to shoot at the characters"
Swiggity53,Sadly I don’t like playing fps with a gun voiced by a domestic abuser. Just going to play any other game not made by a domestic abused
MrDarkboy2010,"""My Talking gun in a game about an annoying talking gun is annoying talks too much.""

Literally what were you expecting?"
Fedoral_Offence,"no matter how much random dialogue from your gun or companions you turn off, it doesn’t change the fact that it’s “jokes” are horribly annoying."
pixelcowboy,But no DLSS or FSR. Insane on a 2022 release.
Empty_Socks,If you have to turn off or adjust the audio because it’s bad… doesn’t really address the problem
CraftyKuko,I should think that anyone buying this game is doing so *specifically* for the dialogue. It's the creators of Rick ans Morty. One of my favourite things about their content is the voice acting.
Suitable_Ad_696969,The irony of being called dumb by someone who likes this game is over 9000. If you want to see what a properly written comedy spin off game is go play the South Park game. I refunded this piece of shit after a couple of ridiculous sketches.
MaryamK7856,Whats the name of this game ?
gary_juicy,Gonna get it on sale
,[deleted]
ThickGanache9262,"I treated the game like I was watching a Rick and morty show. Read, listen and watched everything. If you’re not into Rick and Morty style comedy you’re probably not going to like it. But why the hell did they even buy it? 

I had a lot of fun with it. 

LEZZ DOOO IT!"
Tallen122,The update that added this option was added post-launch. Those “idiots” literally didn’t have the option.
Doctor_Eternal_65,"I've just finished it. Its humour is not really my thing but I never thought it was too much or getting in the way. On the contrary, it gives the world a sense of place and authenticity..... however absurd it may be. Overall, the game is a short but good one. Not really groundbreaking or anything but it was fun enough. The only real complaint I have is the battle musics. They added zero excitement to the fights! But I guess that's more of a personal taste thing.
Anyway, it's on the Gamepass so I'd recommend giving it a try."
Dookie-Trousers-MD,"As a shooter it is very bad.
As a skit, it's funny"
Hascus,How do I change the settings so the creator isn’t a wife beater?
BlueNoori,"I played the game and the Dialoge is funny and the grafiks  are  great but it gets pretty repetitive very fast. The focus is definitely the voiced acting. It you love Rick and morty humor and don't expect phenomenal game play go for it but even then 60€ is too much for what you get, especially considering the game is only about 7 hours long. I recommend get the Xbox game pass for 1€ for a month and play it there like i did."
EcaFace,Wow thats cool i didnt play it for this very reason.
No_Agenda29,"The gun dialogue and personalities are.....literally the point of the entire game.

It's a comedy game.

Don't get me wrong, I had a great time playing it and it feels great and was fun to explore the world, but it's not exactly groundbreaking gameplay-wise. 

It's the atmosphere, the dialogue, and the characters (including the guns!) that made the game so engaging for me. It really feels like you stepped into some weird Rick and Morty dimension.

If you do any amount of research into the game or even just watch the trailer it's pretty clear the talking guns is a big part of it."
Sarato88,Or people just have a different sense of humour.
AviRei9,I don't know who said this game was bad I've only reached like the third area and this game is nothing but awesome I don't think it'll hold my attention for too long cuz I'm not really into adventure games and this one kind of plays like an adventure game with shooting and even though the banter and everything is really hilarious I just get bored of adventure games really quickly it's why I never got into legend of Zelda so I will probably just watch someone else play through the game That way I can watch it while I'm playing a game myself(The first few boss battles were brain dead easy and it's one of the reasons I don't care too much for adventure games They tend to be way too easy for my taste Even if they are great games)
friskykillface,Bad timing lmao
PositiveLadder2359,Roiland got arrested
trowin_away,game still sucked after turning off the banter...
Mrblend27,"It’s alright. If you enjoy those long drawn out jokes that family guy does, then this is the game for you."
