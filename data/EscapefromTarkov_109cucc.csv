_baundiesel_,They should've happened at the start of the wipe.
accuracy_frosty,"I was more upset with the scopes being gone, also M80 is not something that should be pk4"
auster03,"My problem with it is the lack of communication. I want to know what their intentions behind these sudden changes are. Is it putting end game stuff behind light keeper? Is it to prolong early wipe? 

BSG really should’ve made ammo changes at the start of wipe. Yes less than 5% of players are 30+ but why not just change it at the start? It makes more sense to make these meta shifting changes at the start of the wipe.

A lot of changes they make seem so last minute and poorly communicated and just gives BSG a very bad look."
PatriotR6,M80 shouldn't be locked behind LV4 Peacekeeper though. Everything else I agree with.
FlyPenFly,"State of Ammo by Caliber Review

Since the recent changes, I wanted to discuss state of  ammo and see what the hive mind thinks about these calibers.

This isn't some be all end all guide, I just wanted to talk about it. Based off data from: [https://eft-ammo.com](https://eft-ammo.com)

IMO, the goal of the game design should be to allow all calibers to be somewhat competitive mid to late wipe. Prevent the boringness of just 1-2 meta configurations.

~~\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_~~

**9x18:** mostly trash but it's very cheap. Kedr can leg meta, just an early wipe experience.

**9x19:** Recoil on 9mm SMGs are pretty darn good with minimal upgrades, PST is widely available again. End game AP and PBP ammo is exceedingly rare. Would be nice to see a round between PST and AP that is more widely available in the \~25-26 pen which would make it a viable mid wipe round.

**.45:** UMP is a god and the 1911 is a very fun gun. Again, we need a commonly found round between Match FMJ and AP. \~30-31 pen so that it stays viable late wipe.

**5.7x28:** P90 fucks but is so rarely used. Might need a round between SS197SR and L191 or buff SS197SR to 28 pen.

**4.6x30:** Shhh nobody talk about this one. It's my favorite once you unlock the 30 rounders.

**9x39:** VAL was everyone's favorite two or three wipes ago. I don't even know how to fix this market and ammo availability issue with this one or the huge gulf between rounds then all the same.

**.366:** IMO, this is really well balanced. Really crap guns you start out with but very effective in the right hands. Maybe slightly more common AP ammo finds would be nice as I would use that to late wipe.

**5.45:** The recent PS buff is great and PEN is high enough to be a great mid wipe round. With it's 40% frag rate, SCAVs are even more dangerous. But BP and PP are basically the same ammo now, would be nice to see some sort of distinction. I imagine BP and PP are going to be the most commonly shot round in this wipe and the last.

**5.56:** I get Tarkov is supposed to be in Russia so western rounds are not very common but we really need something between M855 and M856A1. Having PP and BP in 5.45 super commonly found and the good 5.56 rounds being very hard to find really gimps it. Makes almost all the western rifles pointless to run instead of 5.45.

**7.62x39:** Controversial but having PS be a little bit later to unlock I think was the right move when you look at cost and quality. It also goes in some good guns. The gulf between PS and BP though is huge, would be nice to have something that's around 39 PEN.

**.300**: Never used it, thoughts on this?

**7.62x51:** Lot of controversy right now around this because M80 was one of my favorite to use with an M1 then RFB mid to late wipe. When you look at the awesome guns this round goes in and how much you can upgrade those, making it harder to get M80 kinda sorta makes sense. What they should have done was also buff the round below it a bit so it still makes sense to use this caliber. There's no reason to use this caliber over 5.45 when TCW does 67d/34p and even PP does 44/36. Sure this does more damage but the 5.45 guns have way less recoil and can full auto all day. Seeing TCW upgraded to 80d/38p would make this caliber much more viable again.

**7.62x54**: Super easy to find LPS early wipe and very common. It's what made Mosin Man, Mosin man. The ammo fucks but the guns kind of suck so this balance makes sense to me. A kitted up SVD looks cool but it's fucking huge and is not nice to use compared to other end game guns.

**12.7:** Lvndmark uses this a lot, I don't know much about it since I don't chad.

**.338:** Same as above."
xXPumbaXx,"The people complain about the randomness of the changes, wich is fine. Like why don't you make this change at the start of the wipes instead of doing that 2 weeks in and no warning. I think people are just annoyed with BSG making random change like that with no warning just randomly with no explanation. Change like this would have been fine if it was announced or it was made at the beginjg of the wipe."
Madzai,"My main issue that with those changes we lack space to store stuff for ""later use"". Like you find a cool gun, but don't have good ammo currently you can't really afford it to just stay in your stash with amount of stuff you already need to keep there. And Armor restrictions. Bigger and heavier armor will see even less use use as no one have space to store that."
Thesaladman98,"It's not that they're hard to get, it's that they're unreasonably tedious to get. Like if you want to run a high tier kit, you need to spend 100-200 raids literally just looking for stuff fir.

If you want to run an ash 12, which was never a good gun, you have to wait 40 fucking hours for ONE raid and then another 20 hours to top off your ammo so you can do another. That's unreasonable. And it's not hard to get, you just get workbench 2 or whatever and then turn off the game for 2 days, like your not even playing the game just waiting simulator.

If they instead gave us hotspots back with good gear/ammo it would be fine, because at least then good gear would be in circulation (slicks and shit) but as it stands you just gotta get super super lucky."
shilunliu,i got the m80 craft so im happy i dont care if it costs a lot i already have an ammo box full of it so im gucci
firebolt_wt,"Except most of those ammos are still available at trader 4, which I'll *never* have available while the game still has wipe cycles because I don't like it enough to be my only hobby.

&#x200B;

So when I want to play a little later on the wipe I'll still be screwed while lots of other people will have all this ammo back (or worse, will be back to spamming .308 weapons that aren't even a real option at LL 2)."
Chinpokkomon,just another decoy to divert from the real issues
sadroobeer,The ammo isnt hard to get... It's a pain in the ass to get. Not only that but it only makes the truly top tier stuff practically impossible to get. It's like they deleted the previous top tier ammo and gear and replaced it with.. mid tier gear..
ReporterClassic8862,"Hope they never touch AP20 and .366 AP. There should still be budget ways to have access to armor penetration mitigated but it being on odd guns, still semi-costly, and not being able to handle class 6 without multiple shots. Ammo changes seem balanced to me."
IreofMars,"Have you considered that multiple groups of people exist?

Personally my only complaint with the ammo changes is the fact that the UMP/.45 FMJ has been the clear budget king for over a year. Highly competitive while being one of the cheapest SMGs in the game and fully attachment ready out of the box. Despite all this and being extremely over represented in PMC loadouts, it has yet to see a nerf or drop in availability of any kind"
Lamazing1021,Yes
Vastroy,I havnt seen anyone complain except for the ash 12
Galagors,I would highly rather have patches happen during a wipe than wait 6 months for changes to happen. People who are complaining about it happening into a wipe are absolutely insane.
hockeyhow7,People on this sub Reddit make it sound like they run into the no life streamers every raid.
TheGirlWhoLived57,Can’t wait to see all the complaint posts in 2 months when y’all still can’t hit level 30 and can’t kill any players because you only hav access to dogshit ammo.
TacticalBill,"I was okay until we fucked over 5.7x28 today. Fuck that change. Each passing day this wipe, I continue to lose faith in a game I love. You know for a FACT you won’t find more SS190 out in the wild. I barely find any 5.7 in the wild."
elitexero,"The issue isn't with the change, it's that they once again did it a week into the wipe.   This has become a consistent trend that favours streamers and people who literally play all day and fucks over the other 85-90% of the playerbase.  It's just getting old at this point."
tigas4d4,"Its just another change to punish casual players again, no lifers will probably be able to get ammo just fine, people with lives gain another disadvantage"
shadowdoggie,People just complain like babies thinking they have a saying...
Darth_Jones_,"This subreddit is a cancer, there's a reason I unsubbed. The people here will complain about anything and everything. The game has some issues currently, they're not game breaking. If you think they are, let the rest of us enjoy ourselves.

I like the ammo changes as well."
Finchi4,Of course they are fine. Somewhat inconsistent but fine. Way to go BSG
MysteriousWeird7126,"Unpopular? Yes.   
Agreeable? No   
A good idea? Probably"
theirongiant74,"There's about 13m tarkov players, 6% off them on this subreddit, of them 1% are on reddit at any given time and of them a tiny percentage are complaining about stuff in the game. 

99% of the user base doesn't give a shit about the whining on reddit."
iRenasPT,Bet they're doing this to make wipe last like an entire year XD
Ron_TheGreat,"I think bsg needs to increase the level requirements for each trader. make ragman and mechanic lvl 4 require lvl 60. pk lvl 3 should be 35, lvl 4 should be 50, change every trader to require more xp and levels to max and space accordingly"
UniqueUserII,"I think the changes are completely fine if they add more ammo in-between even if the ammo isn't that good or has a different purpose, right now m80 and m62 are unlocked at the same time and the only difference is ""damage"" which m62 hard wins in, if there was ammo in t2 and t3 trades that had more damage to limbs like rip or maybe high armor pen but low damage, maybe something in-between as well everyone would be fine. As of right now the only time I'll be using 762x51 is when I unlock m80 which I'll already have m62 by then making it completely useless in the game. 


Tldr: I don't mind hiding all the good ammo but when a gun only has good ammo at level 40 and nothing in-between it just sucks tbh."
Bruffin3,I've never progressed far enough to even purchase any of these rare ammo types nor do I understand how drastically these changes will affect a player like myself since I'm almost never going to be wearing class 5 or 6 armor anyway
xcnigel,They just took away the Schmidt and bender 1x8 too now
im_rank1,High tier ammo shouldnt be buyable period. Is fine
AceVD,Wait until cheaters will start rushing you just cuz you have good ammo and decent armor
zephoidb,"I just want a round thats comparable to 7.62x39 PS for .308. M80 was probably too good for where it was at, but we don't have anything between that and bad rounds. 12.7 probably needs something too. I don't mind rounds that pen class 5+ being FIR or craft only, but we have to have something that can deal with the average class 4 for the larger guns."
steamynick94,I dig it. I’m interested to see how much of a difference it makes. I think my play style will change.
jewdism,">Nah, now that the rounds and armour are hard to get, it makes them that much better and provides more use to lower tiered goods, as tarkov probably should be.

Level 4 armor is already easily obtainable because of scavs, or you can just buy it from ragman level 2. The problem occurs is when you can't buy ammo that even pens level 4 unless you have good enough aim to only use a mosin or are willing to run 762 PS with 90 recoil gun.

Also, imagine starting the game mid-wipe where everyone is running level 5 armor and you can't even buy good enough ammo to pen that until you've unlocked the flee market which then you have to choke up a shit ton of money for mid-tier ammo."
Grim_Game,I love it
Jason-Griffin,"Not only are they fine, they are excellent! I really hope they keep making these changes"
HolyNovie,"Is that so these can be sold by lightkeeper on a black market where you need risk in-raid the items you wanted to sell to other players, like top tier ammos and armors etc"
Rezhyn,They're great. Most of the people complaining about them were the ones getting shit stomped by BP/M62 by now and they got limited. We just need to see armor pushed back a bit more.
InsaneActual,i think it should of happened at the beginning of wipe however im still in favor of the changes...if you get killed by BP it wouldnt feel as bad if you knew how much that player went through to obtain BP
Louqy,"Honestly I feel like people are forgetting that this game is still in beta technically, so there are definitely some massive changes that are going to take place in the time frame before the release. I like the experimental changes that Bsg implements goes to show they’re willing to make changes that could help the game massively and are not scared to experiment like almost every other company out there."
skalapunk,Completely agree
Active-Direction-942,The ammo bans lowkey buffed tier 5 and made tier 6 S tier. Low level players will have a hard time penning 5-6. Altyn gaming is back boyz. Tank meta is back
HOU52k,As a casual player it feels like I have more of a chance
OCWBmusic,I would have rather had top tier ammo be super expensive than unavailable personally
hadie23,Now do it for suppressors
Chaiboiii,"People tested the game with the best ammo and gear available, and got used to it...so now that the game is being balanced to what it's supposed to be, they are all upset they can't have the fancy gun buffet they have been used to! Mark my words. There is a reason there are double barrels, the single breach loaded rifle and the other silly guns...those will be the guns we start with in the end haha"
FknBretto,"It’s their game and I don’t have any say in how they change it, I really just want transparency on the when/why - especially when we are *testing* their game."
ChestBroadshoulder,I just wish crafting times for the good ammo weren't 16 hours. In addition to that we should be able to queue up crafts so theres no wasted time if a craft finishes while Im not there.
Savageking2512,"Everything being expensive and hard to get is dumb, especially without new lore, new events, patches, or wipes.  


You know what your goal is, what lvl or task unlocks and item you want. You wake up grind, and boom, it's not there anymore. Every single thing the player base finds to be a good performer per rouble gets nerfed into the fucking ground. Basically nothing is affordable or reliable anymore. And that sucks ass."
irregular9,"I don't know man. I kinda like suffering in tarkov, but above all else, I love watching the community complain and suffer even more than I do.  So I'm cool with everything bsg comes up to haha. I specially love when said changes screw up the chad meta."
-Shaskis-,I’m not against the changes I’m against ghost changes and mid wipe changes because now everyone is on an uneven playing field because others have had more time to play.
Fancy-Pack9965,The ammo changes is fine but they just need to rework the recoil system
oscorn,"this is a popular opinion, people who are bitching are the vocal minority on this sub."
HelloHiHeyAnyway,"The changes are fine because 762 PS is still ridiculously good.

All the other ammos changed don't make a huge difference except maybe m80? 

If you're a player that's going to use 762 BP, you're also a player that can easily get stacks of it from rogues. 

I can do a single lighthouse run and get ~200 rounds of BP.

Honestly, one of the best rounds no one really talk about is 366 AP-M. Ridiculous flesh damage and good penetration. 1 tapping thoraxes and stuff. Not to mention you an fire it from a semi auto rifle that you can spam click almost automatic."
forShizAndGigz00001,"This change is a good one, they nailed it and armour scarcity."
129912994,"now tarkov is like LPS, TOP OF THE HEAD"
WearFantastic7443,[I think Pest had a very good take on it IMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LsrCuHB6GE)
juicebox_tgs,"I don't like that they didnt do this at the start of the wipe.
I think m80 at pk3 was fine.

Why did they decide to just kill the ash-12, the ammo isn't even thay good and the gun is hardly used"
Atarru_,"I’ve encountered more cheaters than chads with good ammo, I mean seriously can bsg actually get a half decent anti-cheat system"
,I guess it's fine but every change they made inherently hurts the lower level players
Captain_Cheesepuffs,"Removing stuff from traders is fine if I can actually find enough of the shit in raid to use it. Last wipe I found at most 40 PS12B in raid, that's 2 mags for an Ash-12, I'm never going to see this gun in raid again because it was rare enough anyway. Hideout crafts are a fucking joke as well, making me wait 12+ hours for 1 raids worth of ammo. Nobody hates them prolonging the midgame by removing stuff from traders, but when removing something from traders effectively removes it from the game it just fucking sucks. Every wipe we see more and more nerfs and the meta is just more restricted than it was the previous wipe. Nerfing everything into oblivion doesn't get rid of the meta, it just makes it stronger. There will always be a next best thing, if they just buffed everything else to actually be worth running then we could actually have variety late game."
Aceylah,"I've thought for a while that top tier ammo should be less available, armour has just felt pointless for the last few wipes. But now they're restricting armours too the TTK is going to be about the same. They definitely should have done this from the start of wipe though."
Pierr0x,"[You are completely right, it's fine that nobody can buy the ammos I already stockpiled.](https://imgur.com/a/m5R5vud)"
keshi,They should remove all high end stuff from all vendors and make it all craftable in the hideout.
Faesarn,One has to love how 90% of these 'unpopular opinion' posts are actually pretty popular opinions...
pableke7,"I like them a lot, but Im still salty cuz I just have completed grenadier.

The only fair counterpoint I can see is that with hackers bringing your cool kit could mean getting insta killed."
Pyromanuel,"These changes are hidden sniper buffs.

Why run the M700 bolt action? It's the ammo that counts, not the gun. With a Vudu an MDR (or whatever, I don't know whats meta) can snipe and engage close quarters at the same time. Full auto and big mags, hell yeah!

Now you can no longer reasonably run MDR with M80 24/7. If you want to spam your 20 rounders of 7.62 you have to run TCW most of your mags. But if you go snipey with a bolt action, the few M80 last you quite a while. Or M61, whatever.

I actually like that snipers are stronger, but without this artificially video gamey damage boost like ""because it's a bolt action, it must kill in one shot because balance. So here is the 35% dmg buff, enjoy.""."
iAmRadic,This just proves: it’s always the loud minority that dictate the climate of this sub.
ReliefLong6028,Agree
TheSmokeJumper_,"Is this really the unpopular option, everyone in my discord love the changes"
murrkpls,"The ammo changes are more than fine. Besides, Nikita has mentioned more than once that he'd start restricting ammo and gear more and more the 'closer' we get to 1.0. So I don't get why people are acting like they're getting blindsided?"
D3mon13_,I just don’t like removing end game as mid game as sleeper as fuck. It’s just mosin ump shotgun spam which none of those guns are fun to fight against or use imo. It’s their game and they’ll kill it eventually though.
ArkAbgel059,I have been enjoying the pvp a bit more this wipe which says a bunch since I don't like to pvp to much in this game. With people running lower tier ammo I have actually been able to win a few fights. Also the fights have been lasting longer it's not just one tap and I'm dead
Sanagost,"Nope, you are right. BSG is creating their envisioned mid game and it’s great. Meme it all you want, but the people crying about this change and the timing of this change are clearly sniffing glue and can’t read. This is still a beta, and during beta, devs figure out the balance of the game. Ya’ll need to stop treating this as a finished product."
M-Gnarles,Make bullets only craftable with fair recipes. Not easy or super dumb.
IncognitoBandit0,"I support your opinion.
But the spawn rate of these 5.45 AK rounds with armor piercing capabilities  (BS, BP and BT) needs to be lowered and high tier ammo spawn rate boosted a tiny bit with some only able to be bartered for."
lordwerneo92,Not two weeks into the wipe start.
Kilabi,It´s not unpopular. You are just posting a medium that only people use that want to complain. The rest of us is ingame enjoying slightly longer early game and perhaps longer gunfights in the future.
Quigsx,"I wish they left armor alone. I want longer gunfights, now instead of m61 vs slicks its ps rounds vs class 3, the duration doesnt change imo"
jcready92,Not even an unpopular opinion.  People are ten times more likely to post something they don't like vs something they do.  Being negative is edgy and cool didn't you know?
JayyMuro,"I am fine with the changes but I am a bit sad they took SS190 away. now the P90 will never be used and it wasn't used a lot anyway. 

For other things like 855A1, I ran that or M995 mostly the last couple wipes and there will be no change for me there."
LeopoldStotch1,"I think they are moving towards a ""post-wipe"" ecosystem.

You have to try to think how to make this game playable once everyone has reached max level"
ntafax,"only bad change is the removal of ps12b, rest is fine"
Kuhaku-boss,"No matter what changes they do nolifers/stramers plow through super fast anyway...

And people that play less than 3 hours a day everyday get fucked harder"
Sargash,"Everyone is okay with it, if it wasn't mid wipe right as most of the pack is reaching the ability to buy, all it does is expand the gap between tryhards and normals"
travypew,"I’m in the same boat, I’m all for the changes they’re making. Think in compensation the spawn rates should be increased but oof it’s nice being in firefights that last longer than a quarter of a magazine."
Persona_Insomnia,Its selfish but I enjoy the early to mid game so anything to extend that and make the better gear more special im all for.
UsecMyNuts,">now that the rounds and armour are hard to get

Only the rounds. Not the armour. Which just gives an even higher advantage to players who can play 24 hours a day"
Joeys2323,"I agree we need to wait and see how this works out.

However, I am concerned that the lack of hard hitting ammo will make other issues shine. The main issue being recoil. Recoil on almost all guns is painful when full autoing and even tap firing. I think this issue will be even more apparent when you're using shit ammo that pens armor way slower.

For example, running a harder hitting ammo and only landing say 25% of your burst might actually still kill the player. Now that 25% might not even pen. This has been happening in early wipe ever since the recoil changes, but it's usually alleviated by better ammo and guns in the 20+ levels. With the restriction of ammo I think you'll find yourself in a lot more situations where you mag dump someone and still die.

Obviously this is just a guess, so we'll have to see how it all works out."
Thepotionguy,"Honestly if they just fucking removed those ammos that pen class 6, I would be fine with that. I would rather have a longer ttk instead of ""Oh, he saw you first, therefore he wins"" kind of gameplay. You should have to absolutely shred through someone's armor to kill them or aim for the head. 

but that's just mho"
GoTTi4200,I love these changes just wish they started with the wipe
umkhunto,"I think the funnier bit is, people in this sub think if they have better gear, they'd stand a chance against people that no life / play the game as a profession.

If someone has hit 40 in the first week, no amount of gear will make you competitive with them. You can run around in a mutant, with BP, a slick and an altyn, and they will still shit on you with a makarov with one mag."
pthumerianhollownull,It with you
TarkovPlayersHateMe,"4k wipe hours say's you're just bad at finding ammo lvl 9 with tons of meta ammo lots of 762x39 bp ammo   


nerf finding meta ammo extend the early wipe feel and the mid wipe feel its a survival game and it should be harder to find good ammo   


unpopular opinion but nobody in the tarkov community really understands what they want... tarkov players think they want to shoot everyone with meta ammo and dont want anyone else to shoot them back with meta ammo.... bcuz its not fair... nerf meta ammo so its rare as fuck u can fill a box full of meta ammo in a couple dozen reserve runs its a joke"
LordSaladz,"They game is WAY more balanced now. In the past, after a few weeks everyone was running M62, BP, and M855A1 every single raid with plenty of M61 and M995 in their butt to top load. Those ammunition have always needed to be more difficult to obtain! By changing the ammo economy, there are a lot more armor options that actually feel like a realistic choice now! I love it."
blacksite9728,The ones complaining about ammo changes are the same people bitching about getting one tapped every raid. The changes makes fights longer and more enjoyable. The only real complaints are de sync and bad frame rates. Other then that the economy is great this wipe and it feels like everyone is still broke af 2-3 weeks in. This will be the best wipe yet once the audio is fixed up.
NinerGolf,"BSG have wanted to make armour and ammo harder to get for a long time. But they need to introduce it bit by bit over a few wipes, because otherwise people would be even more angry if they banned everything from flea and traders all at once"
Mips0n,So far i liked everything they did to the Game. Even the heatwave event last wipe was a blast for me.
BSYeaton,"Great changes, I agree. At the end of the day we all play by the same rules. Except cheaters of course."
SbarreJR,Casual timmy  left vs the giga chad right 🤣🤣 this thread is hillarious.
yaboyteedz,"Don't forget that a nerf to ammo is a buff to armor. These changes didn't happen in a vacuum. 

Also, its easier to hold on to armor for longer."
ClockworkArcBDO,"I agree. One thing i don't see anybody talking about too is that once we are all high level and max traders... there is actually still going to be risk. I don't know about you folks but outside of not wanting to do die generally, once my shit is maxed out I play a lot more silly. This scarcity helps to keep things feeling special longer. 

Like, chadding up Altyn, Zobralo, .45 Vector with AP? That shit is going to be absolutely terrifying this wipe rather than a goofy meme lord attack."
Sm0kebringer,"The change is not the problem since ages.   


The problem is the restock system."
Chud2212,"Totally agree dude, they just can't win sometimes, they're trying different things to find a decent balance."
FilthyPeasant_Red,"I love it, restricting BP sales only hurts chads. 

Last wipe the only BP that I shot was crafted by myself because I never bothered to do grenadier... So now the people shooting 800 bullets per day won't be able to run only an RD 24/7."
SoNElgen,"Yet they blatantly refuse to adress flechette and buckshot ammo, lmao. Scavs getting the KS23 as well is just absurd."
Significant_Lime7370,I think I like most of the changes minus the move of m80 to pk4. Ll3 would probably be fine
SaltyBumRyu,"As a guy who normally hordes over 1k rounds of ap 6.3, 7.62 BP and 856a1 by mid wipe.... I think the changes are fine so far"
oxGrEeKxo,Landmark actually had a good idea idk if this is his idea or if its even controversial but the best stuff should be found in raid only period.
Professional-Dot-919,"I am all for the changes and spawn rates for ammo in raid is fine because you can craft it, too. My only complaint is that these changes weren't implemented in the beginning of the whipe so the tryhard streamers are already max traders and stocked up on gear and ammo. Maybe if the community wasnt bitching about a wipe, BSG might have soent more time fixing things?"
sleepy_the_fish,"I'm totally cool with ammo changes as well, since everyone will be in same boat.     Now I wish bsg didn't make changes to armor.   Because if you lower good ammo accessibility, but you also lower good armor accessibility, you essentially get the same shit different toilet. Now if BSG kept the armor accessibility the same but made high tier ammo much more rare, that should theoretically raise the average TTK for gunfights besides a random face shot, and I think that would make for a lot of fun. I would really love for BSG to lower the recoil to a more manageable state but also remove auto recoil compensation, so leave it up to the players to control the recoil and make it somewhat manageable for that to happen if you learn the skills.  That would also theoretically raise the TTK which can make some seriously fun gun fights."
VitalityAS,"I don't like that you can get good 7.62x51 ammo at max traders but you cant get any five seven ammo, 7.62x39 or 9mm. We can't have strong ammo outliers or we will have strong metas. Either make everything available or nothing. I would love to see ss190 come back at pk 4 even at like 40 a reset just so I can run the five seven without dedicating like half a day in crafting."
LITF,"I'm fine with ammo changes, as a casual player. I don't play nearly enough to have any, and I like the idea that maybe when I finally get to class 4 armor it will matter at least a bit rather than always getting eviscerated like I've got no armor at all."
rabidninetails,"Here’s my take on this (I’m kind of a pessimist anyway).. it’s just going to make the cheating/rmt worse. 
They jacked with the sound and in a lot of places it’s way too loud so sneaking is out unless you’re perfectly still so that kills that avenue for a lot of people.
Now you don’t have decent amour or rounds to count on when you get into a fight and feels more luck than skill based. So most fights are not going to feel right.
The desync has never been worse and makes it almost impossible to know why shots aren’t hitting or if he’s even in the spot you are aiming at.
Cheating has never been higher (which could also be desync but I have seen tons of videos of the new float hackers that were never around before this wipe.

They focused on the wrong things in the wrong order and the game is in the worst spot in the 7-8 wipes I’ve played. 

The foundation is screwed so of course the house is screwed so to speak."
dayton3000,if the changes were in the game at the start of .13 i dont think alot of people would care but there something about finally getting out of early wipe stuff cuz you worked hard just for bsg to forcibly push you back
IMDEAFSAYWATUWANT,The changes wouldnt be so bad if gunplay and recoil weren't so dogshit.
Sunkysanic,"People have begged bsg for similar changes for *literal years*. Now they’re making steps and people still complain or bitch.

There is no winning for bsg, and probably the reason they don’t come around anymore."
escanor_hype,"As a very casual player with limited playtime, I like the change, Like with everything, we will adapt, it's an update that is in effect for everyone, not just a select few, so I don't know what part of it is apparently unfair. It feels like a true survival extraction shooter now if we actually have to scavenge for them instead of being able to just buy the best of the best any time we want. Personally I would also like the flea to either get removed or be limited to just selling attachments, being able to do more than that feels like the player gets too much power still.

Edit: Lol people still misusing downvotes as a ""I disagree"" button in 2023, certified Reddit moment."
Hi_Limee,This is what tarkov was meant to be. More hardcore on the survival. Not everyone running the best kits and ammo. Nikita said a long time ago theyre testing all of this stuff out and eventually theyre going to squeeze it out and make it more rare to have. And I love it to be honest. As soon as I get max traders the game starts getting stale because the fights arent fun. theyre fast.
JustSeraph,"They are just pissed they have to use medium ammo, guns etc even in high level and I (as a casual player) love it! Finally i still have a fighting chance to compete, even late wipe."
KillaB123,"They are more than fine, this will extend the mid wipe. Top ammo and armor should be FIR only. Full stop."
HearMeOutGuy,"I love the changes this wipe, market at 15 and ammo and armour banned from market is so much better for the game"
F_Dingo,"I never used 7,62x51 or was able to buy 7,62 BP from the trader (I always crafted), also never was able to buy L6 armor from the traders. Chads can fuck off and wear the L4 armor like I have been with pride and adjust."
dimsumdonair2,"Best thing since Christmas 

I love the tears of a man who bitches about the most op ammo becoming harder to find 


Fuckin let's go!"
D3_BellDropper69,"Not unpopular opinion, only unpopular on amongst the active complainers here. Hopefully now Timmy will actually use that BP ammo he finds instead of putting it on flea cuz he wants roubles to kit a gun he will die with cuz he uses shit ammo lol"
Blacklist3d,The vocal minority speak the loudest.  Most people like the ammo change.
Firecracker048,"Its not that the changes are unpopular, its that they are being implamented 1) Mid-wipe and 2) Without a severe crackdown on cheaters and hackers."
