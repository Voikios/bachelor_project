Lure852,+1 democrat -1 GOP if Santos loses his seat.
,"Hey Kev, you really, really wanted this.

You asked for this. You begged for this."
Spin_Quarkette,"McCarthy's speakership is really an embarrassment.  It should have been embarrassing enough that he sold himself out to the MAGA wing of the party, showing just how utterly desperate he was to hold the gavel.  But now his entire speakership is turning into a reflection of the MAGA clown cart.

I sure hope it is abundantly clear to my fellow New Yorkers who voted for GOP reps that we will not get a single days worth of honest work from this Congress. All we will get is more reality TV stunts, headline grabbing none sense, and dysfunction.  Please - 2024 - we need to vote these clowns out, and that includes the Uber Clown Stafanik."
muchaschicas,He's going to blow a gasket.
jl55378008,"A reporter needs to ask:

GoldenWar,"Swalwell was exonerated of wrong doing in the Chinese spy incident, didn't lie about it.  His term on the intel committee was going to expire this month anyway.  This is just theater from McCarthy."
was_and_wasnt,"Two reasons.  First and foremost, no matter what McCarthy says in public, he is never going to toss him.  Because, reason two, he desperately needs him to maintain any semblance of a working majority.  If Santos stole the entire national budget, McCarthy would find a way to make that legal so that he would not have to toss Santos.  Count on it."

samwstew,Because he’s powerless against the fascists. He made deals RO put the absolute worst of the reps on the most important committees to get his speakership.
out_of_shape_hiker,"""You asked me a question. When I answer it, it's the answer to your question. You don't get to determine whether I answered your question or not, okay? In all respect,""

Reeks of entitlement. He's absolutely flustered that he has to provide justification for his actions. There are so many Republicans in power that get offended at the idea that they have to answer to the public. ""How *dare* you not accept and print my buzzword replies."" They act as though they believe they are lords, and we, the little folk, are not to question them."
SpiralToNowhere,"Removes Schiff from intelligence bc 'integrity', defends Santos and Trump to the death.  Sure, that makes sense.  /s"
Macrosophy,"Obviously, the “R’s” have a super slim majority so they need as many swamp creatures they can get."
strvgglecity,Don't forget he's a traitor who supported insurrection and should rightfully be in prison for life
voigtster,"Lol. This bit was hilarious. 

>	“At one point, a reporter from Slosh Central posed a curious question, ‘Mr. Speaker, how are you feeling from your surgery?’ Seeming puzzled by the question, McCarthy asked for clarification. The reporter retorted, ‘You know, after having your balls snipped?’ “"
robodrew,"Here's what I want to know, why is Santos being put on committees at all?  Regardless of the scandal surrounding him.  There are 435 members of the House.  Not all of them sit on committees.  And yet this guy ~~Anthony De~~ George Santos comes out of nowhere, has only been a politician for less than 3 weeks, and yet he gets a committee assignment?  What's going on here?  What does Santos have on McCarthy?"
Shavethatmonkey,"Because Santos is running that party now.  It seems the more ignorant and awful the Republican (MTG, Boebert, Gaetz, McConnell, etc) the more Republicans love them."
btbam666,Hypocrisy by the GOP.
EisVisage,"> At a press briefing, a reporter challenged McCarthy on why he had removed Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff from the House Intelligence Committee on the basis of accusations he lied, while Santos continues to hold the committee assignments.

> ""You asked me a question. When I answer it, it's the answer to your question. You don't get to determine whether I answered your question or not, okay? In all respect,"" McCarthy snapped back. 

> Appearing angry at the line of questioning, he continued: ""You just raised a question and I'm going to be very clear with you. The Intel Committee is different. You know why? Because what happens in the Intel Committee, you don't know,"" he said, pointing at the reporter to underscore his point. 

> ""What happens in the Intel Committee, [with the] secrets that are going on in the world other members of Congress don't know,"" McCarthy said.

Does that sound like a stable man who should be House Speaker to you?"

ToolemeraPress,"McCarthy, when not reading a prepared speech, stumbles, uses incomplete sentences, angers easily and generally shows he is not up to the job"
LamarBearPig,"To save you some time:

Kevin McCarthy without all the extra bullshit: “but what about the democrats?!” “They lied about some things so Santos lying about literally everything in his entire life is A-OK and fine by me”

Edit: wanted to add - also Kevin: “we recognize this guy is a huge national security risk which is why we’re keeping him off of certain committees, but we can’t afford losing a seat so we’re gonna keep him”"
extracensorypower,"Translation: It's OK for gay, cross-dressing, liars and fraudsters to serve in congress if they're Republican. Wonder what their reaction would be if this guy was a Democrat?"
twesterm,"> At a press briefing, a reporter challenged McCarthy on why he had removed Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff from the House Intelligence Committee on the basis of accusations he lied, while Santos continues to hold the committee assignments.

oof, that was a pretty brutal question. I hope they continue to give him zero leeway.

You know McCarthy has absolutely nothing when he starts resorting to _well if Biden did it..._.

Also, he continues with the _the people elected him to he gets to serve_ line and it is complete 100% bullshit. The people elected a character that George Santos played, they did not elect George Santos.  It's as if Martin Sheen were running for president as if he were President Bartlett and then people being surprised that when he was in office he was actually just Martin Sheen."
EdenG2,"Wish these a****** Republican legislators who complain about people not working, would work."
crackedgear,"""You asked me a question. When I answer it, it's the answer to your question. You don't get to determine whether I answered your question or not, okay? In all respect,""

Yeah that’s not at all how that works.

“What are you going to do about Santos?” 

“Mutton is delicious. See? I answered your question!”"
DAEDALUS1969,What is that word salad he’s spouting? For a second I thought I was reading a Trump transcript.  What he said literally made no sense.
cmgchamp2,"Yes we're going to punish Adam Schiff because he participated in Donald Trump's impeachment.  Yes we're oging to punish Eric Stallwell for some rumor I heard about him talking to someone I didn't like.

But George Santos.  Nah.  The fraudulent, lying, drag queen, stealing, con job SOB hasn't done anything deserving not to sit on a Republican committee.

Right Repubs?"
Mission-Basis-3513,Trump Jeff Dunham’d this guy so hard.
MrRisin,Why did McCarthy keep pointing at himself when he was talking about Adam Schiff?
randomnighmare,"Because McCarthy only cares about the votes. All Republicans do and that is why they support anyone with an ""R"" besides their name. Roy Moore, Donald Trump, Santos, even back in the 1870s they were willing to abandon the South and reconstruction so they can hold onto the White House, etc..."

Im_Ashe_Man,Hearing Kevin McCarthy claim he has integrity was the laugh I needed today.
zoicyte,"kevin mccarthy isn't very smart. that's all there is to it really.

the answer is simple: he needs Santos' vote same as he needs the maga vote. in this case, it's even grosser though, he has no good answer for his support, and when a stupid person gets cornered and has to answer for something they know is bs, the instinctual reaction is to lash out. so he lashed out."
BadPackets4U,"I'd be cranky too if I had to defend that shit show.  They created it, now deal with it."
Ivorcomment,"Kevin McCarthy, after his capitulation to the extremists in his party, is trapped between a rock and a hard place. 

One can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice - only the most blind and most deaf would fail to observe it. It took him fifteen votes to gain the speakers gavel, the most in more than a century, but the control he had to grant to his fringe element means it will take only one vote to dispose of him, possibly making him the shortest ruling speaker ever.

Hence his anger when questioned by the media about those supporting him such as George Santos whom even Kevin knows is a charlatan. He is so desperate to cling to that gavel he would even defend Kim Jong-un if that would preserve his position."
SmokeyDBear,"> You asked me a question. When I answer it, it's the answer to your question. You don't get to determine whether I answered your question or not, okay?

Sorry Kev but that’s not how questions work."
Grimjack-13,"He needs a Republican vote period. That’s the only reason. The man is sold out any integrity he make have once had just to hold that gavel. Which he holds it now by the slimmest of margins. 

Besides all of Santos’ lies and misdeeds pales in comparison to Trump and McCarthy kissed that ring too."
dbeman,“Stop trying to hold me accountable!”
Jolly_Grocery329,I love the part where he says integrity matters.  LMAO.  Unreal
miaminaples,Because he needs Santos's vote.
mrbigglessworth,The (R) after his name is more important than doing what is right.
sugar_addict002,"Because Republicans never let values interfere with power.  Values, morals, laws ... those are things for the people not the rulers."
Nick9046,What if George ran as a republican because he knew they're too brain dead to see his BS and  democrats would smell his BS a mile away. 🤭🤔
PapaBeahr,Weakest most pathetic Speaker ever. He'll be forced to cave into everything any House republican wants or he'll get voted out.
3dnewguy,"Remember what Republicans did to Al Franken? This is the height of hypocrisy. Good Christian values, Kevin?"
Special-Literature16,He is why out of this league he doesn't have a law degree or anything that would qualify him too be speaker..all he has is a jar full of waxed lips for all the asses he has kissed over all the years he has been in politics... Read his bio... This guy can really kiss ass...
kchrules,Even republicans don’t want Santos. Over at the conservative sub they are upset with him too. But they don’t want to give up seats
LightBulbMonster,He can't. He NEEDS every slim vote he can get. George out here trolling everyone.
PlayedUOonBaja,Already cracking in less than a month.
SwnsasyTB,"Because they ONLY care about _POWER_
If they lose that seat and a Democrat wins in the special election he loses a tad of power.. Republicans DO NOT care about this country, WE THE PEOPLE or their constituents. Hell, they are literally talking about raising sales tax 30%!!"
0nlyhalfjewish,"If you go to the Twitter post linked in the article, you will see a whole host of conservatives cheering McCathy for defending Santos.

Our country is so divided and screwed."
bananaspy,"Even if you set aside the concessions that he is bound to by the nut jobs, they won't remove Santos because a special election being held to replace him could potentially mean losing a seat to Democrats.  Power is more important than integrity in their eyes."
Adsequalbads,Did McCarthy hook up with santos?
tk421jag,This isn't going away Kev. It will only get worse. Learn how to handle stuff like this because it's all the GOP has these days.
t13v0m,"McCarthy doesn't care if Santos is right, wrong, or indifferent. He just wants the vote.He'll use every excuse in the book to just preserve that one vote."

frostfall010,"Actually yes the person asking the question can say whether or not you answered it. If I ask you what color the sky is you can say “two” and answer the question in the literal sense of answering a question but did you answer my question? No. 

McCarthy acting like he has any gumption after willingly submitting to the humiliation the MAGA assholes demanded of him to become Speaker is a friggin joke."
Smart_Skin_3440,"Well, how do you think he got that speaker position? He promised to not get rid of Santos. (Among other things)"
rgpc64,"He has the spine of a jellyfish, a forked tongue and the instincts of a tick."
BoosterRead78,Very simple. Kevin and the GOP can’t afford to lose JUST ONE Republican. They will completely fold. Even if the FBI arrests one in the spot with a perfect arrest he be: “no you can’t take him away I need him!”
SpritzTheCat,"People like Kevin McCarthy should not serve Congress. They are too emotional to lead or govern.

Also, I hope the reporters hound him every day over this. Let him fume and cry like a baby. He's covering for corruption plain and simple."
plehmann72,"Let's be honest.

McCarthy is a spineless weasel.

Noone ever thought he would do the right thing if he had a choice to prioritise country that threatened his power or position.

His backflip on Trump is one of the most cringeworthy moments in politics ever. Rivalled only by Ted Cruz"

SomeNoteToMyself,Jesus. The right is so corrupt
Iamnottouchingewe,Sold his soul to the devil and now he’s going to regret it. The stress is real the pressure is real. Can’t please everyone leads to not pleasing anyone.
62frog,I’d almost respect his actions more if he just straight up said he needs Santos’ vote. Quit the “integrity” bullshit.
JohnStamosAsABear,"What is McCarthy talking about with Swalwell lying and the Chinese spy accusation? 

He legitimately just used a whataboutism to justify ignoring Santos' lying and then said ""integrity matters to me."""
IagreeWithSouthPark,Only a matter of time before we hear “where the money comes from doesn’t matter”
trpnblies7,Wasn't a rule made that one person could call for a vote to remove him as speaker? Why has no dem done that yet?

Dear God this is *so lame* does anyone fall for this?"
pedalpusherz,Because he's a spineless coward?
titsngiggles69,He's so emotional.  Is he suited for the job?
SockFullOfNickles,Lmao he’s such a spineless little worm. He’s competing with Cruz for the 1st place spot. Remember when he tried to do the right thing and within 24 hours was back down in Florida kissing Trump’s ass? Pepperidge Farms remembers.

Is...is he suggesting that Schiff wasn't elected???"
TheWayNorth,"The guy literally turned around after 1/6 and acted like Trump didn’t do anything.

Are we supposed to think Kevin is going to hold Santos accountable when he didn’t even try to be a part of the few Republicans who condemned Trump’s actions?

McCarthy is only loyal to himself and his party."
strain_gauge,He holds his power by the slimmest of margins.  McCarthy will do anything to keep that vote.
GrimmRadiance,It’s hypocrisy.  They can pretend it’s different all they want but the logic is the same and exceptions have not been made clear.  It’s just hypocrisy.
dominantspecies,He’s such a weak piece of shit
Jump_Yossarian_,He's just too emotional to be Speaker. Better replace him with a woman.
After-Diaspar,"Let him lash. Republicans are always talking about Congress critters needing to bow to their bosses, the people. So keep hammering him, and any politician of any stripe, who plays double standards or refuses to answer legitimate questions. That is one  job of the press, to hold elected officials feet close to the fire."

skybluecity,Kevin McQarthy doing the most Kevin McQarthy thing
bottleblu3,pathetic excuse of a leader. ready for 2024 so we can vote his ass back into the minority
RobbyRock75,"Really looking forward to McCarthy being an effective leader of the House... insert ironic laugh, eye roll and paradoxical expression. 

America.. maybe the reason we suffer at the hands of liars, thieves and rich people is we can't get together anymore and force them to legislate on behalf of all American's basic needs instead of their own self interests?"

Alternative-Flan2869,Kev is no leader - he’s a puppet of trump and the kookoos who sold out the country so he could hold a wooden hammer.
Shnazzytwo,"Because if one republican sees consequences for their actions, it could be a domino effect for the GOP."
karenskygreen,"Trump enabled this insanity,  thing about Trump is that he was already famous when he ran for president, so his lies were constrained to being wealthy, a a aucessful businessman etc  but Santos is unknown, his lies have no boundaries, that fucking guy has to be the most prolific liar ever. I was listening to a radio interview where he mentioned he was a socialite, he is a natural liar, and lying is like breathing to him. 

He has apologized for nothing, and the Republicans are doing nothing about it. He is out Trumping Trumo."
Irishish,">	At Wednesday's press conference, McCarthy again pushed back at claims he was seeking to preserve the GOP's narrow congressional minority by refusing to punish Santos.

Does anyone actually believe that? Has he somehow convinced *himself* this isn't about the majority?"
zoopest,Lashing out at reporters is a simple way to demonstrate you’ve lost control
AmbitiousDistrict374,"That's the lesson for today, if you want to get elected with lies and deciet and actually stay in office, run as a Republican. Luckily for George Santos L Halper, he's pretending to be a Republican."

CharToll,Toilet Paper Tiger
Cainga,It’s cause he barely holds a majority and is held hostage by the wackos already. Giving up 25% of your majority votes to punish him isn’t worth it.
fps916,"You want to know why?

Because Kevin, in order to become speaker, had to cave in to demands from the extreme part of his party.

One of those demands was that **any one republican** can start the process the remove him as speaker.

So he can't afford to piss off literally any house republican. Which includes Santos"
curlyfreak,"“How does it feel to elect the first drag queen to congress?” 

Gotta ask the real questions"
Adept-Mulberry-8720,"excuse me, he should not be punished, he should be removed from his Senate seat for fraud, lying, campaign contributions fraud and stealing money! The punishment would a sanction or reprimand and would not remove him from office which he goes not deserve to sit in!"
Batgirl219,Wow. How did he get this far if he can't handle an accustion of avoiding the question? Like...he just made it more obvious he sidestepped the question. Politicians are supposed to be good at nonanswers.
Nootzer47,He sold his soul for the gavel🤣
hamsterfolly, “Because he’s one of us!” -McCarthy
Charming_Benefit_819,"Santos on the Intel Committee presents serious threats to national security since virtually everything he has claimed about himself has been a lie. He has been accused of check fraud, lying about his entire resume, and even his parents' background. He very well could be a foreign asset. The fact that he has been allowed to sit in Congress is mind boggling."
Drpnsmbd,I’m guessing Santos performs at McCarthy’s birthdays?
bobartig,"Look, he's just the de facto leader of the majority party. He isn't responsible for what his members say, or do, or don't do. He isn't responsible for their actions, his actions, the state of Congress, or the proper functioning of government. He's *just the Speaker of the House*, now leave him alone so he can go back to self-dealing and profiteering from his status and position like a good little grifter. Geez, already."
nothatdoesntgothere,"It's amazing how clear he can be when operating as a sycophant. I actually agree with the logic and applying that logic correctly and consistently. 

So, Kevin, POTUS also has access to highly sensitive material that affects national security. Why, then, are your lips attached to Donald Trump's asshole when he lied so persistently, so profusely, and with complete disregard for everyone else in the world? Why did you not vote to impeach him on either vote? When does integrity not matter? 

I think we all know the answer to that last one. GOP is party over god, over country, over morality."
Bongin_tom9,I bet he was harder on his kids when grounding them.
PlantainCreative8404,"Because the GQP is now the party of insane ass clowns who have no ability to do ANYTHING except follow fox news culture war fucking garbage to keep their base scared and pissed off.

Because in order for the GQP to exist they need SOMETHING to be pissed off at, or their entire ideology falls on its stupid fucking face. Most recently it's drag queens. Next week who knows. Its fucking pathetic. They have nothing but hate and intolerance. It's utter garbage."

DetectiveMoosePI,"McCarthy lashed out because he knows the answer, the press knows the answer, and McCarthy *knows* the press *knows* the answer. McCarthy cannot lose Santos’s support. Santos might seem like one district, one vote but he represents the more extreme faction of the GOP that hates government, any government, even a government run by their own team. To them Santos represents the perfect example of a flawed politician.  

It may seem strange but to me it’s similar to how all these evangelicals supported Trump because they thought he would bring about the End Times(TM)"

bunnyvulture,"What a shit response ""He said that if all politicians were held to exactingly high standards, President Joe Biden would be unfit to serve.""

Ok... and... It's not like Democrats are Biden or no one else unlike Republicans who can't get off the Daddy Trump train. Standards are a good thing and this kind of response just shows that Republicans can talk and talk and talk all they want about God and how it makes them the better party but it's all just bullshit. This was the same huge issue with Trump with the lying. Being a liar and being caught in lying about the STUPIDEST shit makes you a completely worthless person in government.

platinum_toilet,Kevin has a rough start to being speaker.
StrangerAtaru,It's the same reason that Brits won't call another election: the Conservatives control everything and know things will turn out bad if they do so they find loopholes and twist themselves into a pretzel to prevent it from happening.
atonyatlaw,"Man, I'm a pretty damn far left liberal, but that answer seems pretty freaking legit to me.

I want Santos out of office just as much as anyone else, but it's totally reasonable to remove Schiff and Swalwell from the Intel committee.

Edit: I meant to say *if* what he says about Schiff and Swalwell is true."
playdohplaydate,"His answer seems fair, I dunno what’s wrong with it. Santos and Schiff are still in congress even though they are liars. Santos lied to get the job, Schiff lied while on the job. Santos could be qualified to represent the demographics he pretended to be a part, Schiff isn’t qualified to be on the Intel committee.

I mean really, a lying politician is the definition of a politician"
2109dobleston,"The video shows his answer wasn’t crazy or anything

He says Schiff said things he knew weren’t true, he knew they weren’t because he was in the Intel committee

He says Swalwell had a relationship with a Chinese spy 

He says Santos is…well…Santos 

But despite those things they got elected so they get committee appointments just not things like Intel

I’d invite comments about how he’s right or wrong"
BotElMago,Meh.
