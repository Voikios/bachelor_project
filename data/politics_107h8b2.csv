darkness_escape,When should we expect an announcement on charges vs no charges
spongebue,">Fulton County Judge Robert McBurney [...] has scheduled a hearing for Jan. 24 that will address what portions, if any, of that report will be released to the public.

>A court filing says that the grand jury voted to recommend that its report be published.

Oooh, this could be fun!"
housemeat,was this the thing where he committed election fraud and it was recorded and the whole world heard it and the republicans still want him to be president?  he's committed so many other crimes i almost forgot about this one.  busy guy.
Ban-Circumcision-Now,And this took two years!!!!
CaptainNoBoat,"This case could be the most viable criminal investigation against Trump for a number of reasons:

It focuses on direct, smoking-gun evidence in Trump's hour-long phone call to Brad Raffensperger. In it, Trump not only asks for Raffensperger to ""find 11,780"" votes multiple times. He accuses of him of committing crimes, threatens him with legal consequences, insults him and berates him dozens of times, and is corrected on false statements in real time.

Here's a few gems:

>So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.

>And you are going to find that they are — which **is totally illegal**, it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know what they did and you’re not reporting it. **That’s a criminal, that’s a criminal offense**. And you can’t let that happen. That’s a **big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that’s a big risk.**

>Well, **under law, you’re not allowed to give faulty election results**, okay? You’re not allowed to do that. And **that’s what you done**. This is a faulty election result. And honestly, this should go very fast. You should meet tomorrow because you have a big election coming up, and because of what you’ve done to the president — you know, the people of Georgia know that this was a scam — and because of what you’ve done to the president, a lot of people aren’t going out to vote. And a lot of Republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president. Okay? They hate it.

As a state prosecution, it also has none of the conflict-of-interest or executive privilege hurdles that a federal prosecution has to clear. Fulton County is deep blue for a jury selection, and the charges Trump may face are exceptionally bad for him.

The DA is supposedly weighing election fraud, conspiracy, oath of office violations, racketeering and other offenses.

These are prominent figures that were subpoenaed:

- Georgia's Governor  
- Georgia's Attorney General  
- Georgia's Lieutenant Governor  
- Georgia Secretary of State  
- A Georgia U.S. House Representative  
- Multiple Georgia State Senators  
- Multiple Georgia House Reps  
- The Cobb County Elections Director  
- U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham  
- Trump's lawyer - John Eastman  
- Trump's lawyer - Rudy Giuliani  
- Trump's legal adviser - Jenna Ellis  
- Trump's lawyer - Boris Epshteyn

Giuliani, along with 16 Republicans in regards to a fake elector scheme are allegedly informed criminal targets. John Eastman is another interesting subject, Trump's lawyer who orchestrated the fake elector scheme and had many email correspondences that have implicated him and Trump in conspiracy as noted by a federal judge in a separate civil suit.

Last but not least, GA is one of few states where the governor does NOT have clemency power. Pardons are decided by a board, and only given retroactively - after a sentence is served.

We could see a charging decision (and subsequently indictments) by Fani Willis within weeks."
liililllllliilillill,"So now, THIS is something that house republicans in DC can’t do shit about, right?"
KeepCalmAndBaseball,Hopefully the first of many shoes to drop!  I have faith this will lead to many indictments
heavensmurgatroyd,All these cases against trump have truly show cased how our justice system is completely designed to allow the wealthy and famous to buy their way out. Sadly I expect yet again to see nothing of any consequence to happen this waste of skin.
Dazzling-Finger7576,Lock him up
scottrogers123,Had the defendant been a poor or a Democrat they would already be locked up. The application of laws on the rich and powerful moves slowly (if at all).  I'm not going to hold my breath that anything will come of this.
_SpaceTimeContinuum,Indict the motherfucker now!
AndISoundLikeThis,I suspect that they won't release the report if they decide its contents warrant empaneling a regular grand jury to decide what the indictments will be. (This grand jury could not suggest indictments.)
afinlayson,Anyone else think Brazil is doing a better job at handling this type of corruption. Never would have guessed
RobotNoisesBeepBoop,It’s 2023. Charge him with whatever is legit or stfu. I’m sick of the lack of accountability and the lack of balls of those meant to hold people accountable.
Infodog19,Lock him up!
Glittering-Bunch6551,"I just want to find 201 **upvotes**, which is one more than we currently have."
LithiumAM,How the fuck is he on tape attempting to pressure a state Secretary into manufacturing votes and just…nothing? It’s unreal. It’s fucking undeniably DOCUMENTED what he did.
taez555,"I don't get what the big deal is.    Is it really illegal to use your position of power to just ASK, and possibly mildly threaten someone, for 11,000 more votes?"
,The day I see Trump in handcuffs is the day I'll believe our justice system isn't totally fucked.
niobiumnnul,"Hmmm, whatcha going to do DA Fani Willis?"
snoopingforpooping,He’s on tape asking to find votes!!! Jfc
,This is like a bad tv series that should’ve ended 4 seasons ago.
Fantastic_Sea_853,"Due to the caste system in America, no charges will be filed."
LPhilippeB,Stop probing and start jailing
DerekStu,The work isn't complete until that SOB is in jail!
WitchersBrew,I'm done having faith that something will happen. Get back to me when he's in cuffs.
airbrat,"Honestly Im so tired of these posts, nothing ever happens.

Oh we caught tRump shooting someone on video? Cool story but hey lets go throw that kid in jail for marijuana possession for 3 years with the quickness."
iamnotyourdog,And let me guess... Nobody gets charged as usual?
LAESanford,Can he be arrested now?
Chefboirudeboi,"Holy crap  here's an idea, just arrest and charge the criminals like you would for any "" normal"" citizen. Special this and grand that......fuck off and let me know when these assholes are behind bars."
DonnyMox,Alright. Then show us some results.
CKKovac6576,"This process has taken so long, I’m just going to start asking if we’re there yet…

Are we there yet?"
space_coder,"I've grown sceptical when it comes to politicians actually getting punished for their crimes, therefore I suspect the judge will take the special grand jury findings and make the benign portions public. After seeing that nothing damning is made public, the DA will simply claim that the report didn't have enough to indict."
Qwerty1bang,"> completes work

The job isn't finished until the indictment work is done."
Daydream_Sunscreen,Not news unless we read about next steps = indictments. 3 years of “soooo this happened next and there’s gonna be some more paperwork filed OMG what will happen? We don’t know BUT l…”
scarlet_speedster985,And nothing will come of it because the one percenters can do whatever the hell they want with no consequences.
TGCOM,"Good, throw him in prison already so I can stop hearing and reading about Trump 24/7.  Please.  Dear god... please."
kuulmonk,"Tick, tick, tick."
TheCanadianEmpire,"I’ve said this a million times and I’ll say it again, add it to the fucking pile."
moodyblue8222,More crimes tRump will walk away from??? Whoever said no one is above the law never met today’s republicans or Supreme Court members as apparently they can get away with any crime!
Lexromark,Its been almost 7 years of investigations and nothing has yet happened to Trump.
Special-Literature16,Indictments are coming....
TheCoolestFactor,Two years of having the damn tape and a shut case and we are still at a fucking nowhere. This is a joke. Will it even lead to indictment or will they just shrug it off again?
rangerhans,Trump is going to be probed until he dies of old age.
yellowbin74,Possible? It's pretty fucking obvious!
thebegbie,"Now that it’s complete, they can put it in a drawer and lock it away, and never open it again. Because that’s how Teflon Don works. It doesn’t fucking matter and we’re wasting money because nobody wants to go after him. I am so sick and tired of hearing all of his corruption-bullshit and all of these lawsuits, and nothing comes of it. The Mueller report was just the beginning. Nothing will come of anything."
Orwells-Bastard-Son,And the results are?? Or do we have to wait for the completion to complete?
sdnnhy,"I have so much fatigue and apathy on this matter. I can’t read any more articles or have any emotional connection to it. I fully expect years of meaningless bureaucratic bullshit ending with absolutely nothing being accomplished, supporters on either side further divided, and zero consequences for anybody that most deserves them. Hopefully I am wrong but I’m checked out."
Negative_Mancey,What about all those people he just doesn't pay?
ThisGuy6266,"The grand jury has recommended that a committee be formed to choose members of a second committee to recommend to the DOJ that Trump maybe, possibly should be indicted….depending on what a fourth committee says."
DooDooRoggins,I’ll believe indictments possible when I see them. Otherwise another nothing.
MasterMahanaYouUgly,"Go, Fani, go!!!"
SupermarketOverall73,Did they loose the recording of the phone call ?
usafnerdherd,"Dude’s been probed more than my second cousin, Cleetus. When are they gonna charge him with something?"
heavy_deez,"I'm pretty sure we all heard that recording two years ago, so I suppose we're at a crossroads here with not only this, but *all* of the crimes which donald trump has committed yet not been charged with: either take a stand and charge him in order to preserve the integrity of our nation, or declare that this is how modern politics is done, and it will become the norm for both parties, and all hope is lost."
Verdick,"It's taking a grand jury just to decide if it's worth actually charging someone with a crime, leading to another jury trial?  How many layers are in this shit sandwich?"
charminglab420,And then?
babydavissaves,So? Her emails! His son! Classified documents! Why is the Republican PR machine so. much. f*cking louder!? This will fizzle too. Thank goodness we fought for his tax returns. It was in the news cycle for two days.
Baboonofpeace,"So, a story with a hot headline that raises expectations but reveals nothing."
,"They have him on a recorded line committing a crime, the fact they have to “prove for possible crimes” means they’re not going to do a damn thing. Trump will remain free so his name can generate money for news outlets with headlines like this. Is poors should know better than to think a rich person would be punished haha yeah right"
LastValyrian,Just wake me up when Trump is getting his orange butt fucked in Prison.
Knighth77,"""Despite the overwhelming amount of evidence, the jury finds that nothing can be done about said crimes."""
TS_SI_TK_ORCON,"Show me the Donald Trump handcuffed perp-walk, otherwise it's just Kabuki theater for the corporate media."
yalogin,"Ok it can go either direction then. They can Mueller out or actually file charges. I, being the pessimist, will bet on them Muellering out unless I see charges."
kingdazy,"Everyone brace yourselves!

Another ""it's inconclusive, not enough to press charges"" announcement incoming!"
Lanark26,"Wake me when there's an indictment.

 It's been years and multiple investigations and crimes the treasonous grifting prick is going to die of old age before he sees the inside of a courtroom.

This is just getting ridiculous."
splgackster,"And the result of the testing was.....



Crime. Yes. There was crime.

And the result of the crime will be....  
Nothing, still more nothing."
PrideofPicktown,"Lock that motherfucker fucking up. We shouldn’t have to ask Georgia to save our democracy again, but here we are! Lock that motherfucker fucking up!"
Slapgrubbin,"Another day, another nothing-burder"
Gummy_yumyum,It’ll be fun to hear them recommend charges and then nobody does.
PlumppPenguin,"Nothing soup. America never punishes the rich and powerful, and there will never be charges against Trump. He will continue getting away with everything, and he'll die rich, fat, and happy."
dimechimes,"If Garland lets a state beat him to the indictment,  his cowardice will no longer be questioned."
kittenTakeover,So when will they detail all the crimes that they're going to let Trump get off with?
queuedUp,And presumably like everything else nothing will happen
duckofdeath87,Better late than never
matticusblack,'Possible'
hdjenfifnfj,"Placing my bets on no charges.  
  
Or 
  
Charges, but so little/inconsequential that ultimately nothing happens, for example, a $100 fine."
Hot-Bint,This may be the one that nails him but I’m not holding my breath
lloopy,"I read the title of this article, and all I can think is, “fuck you “. Either convict him in jail him I don’t fucking talk about it."
chalkoutlin3,not a chance he will be convicted.. and that’s if he ever gets charged…
WH1SKEYHANGOVER,"This will be another nail in his coffin along with his tax returns 😂

If we stop giving this dipshit and his putrid spawn any sort of press maybe they will disappear in to obscurity"
ojknows94,Just throw these people in jail all ready its been two years
redwoodtree,Another $5 in my “he’ll be indicted any day now” fund?
ResponsibilityDue448,The wheels of justice turn slowly but they grind exceedingly fine.
limesthymes,"“We found he did it all, every last thing he was accused of….we will be recommending a slap on the wrist so no one’s feelings get hurt.”"
FarmhouseFan,Yes but will anyone care?
lemongroovian,I bet he loves those probes!!
TupeloSal,Wake me up when they cuff him
Naytosan,👏👏And now they'll sit on it until the opportune time.
MattMan2k17,What are the odds he gets the book thrown at him?
Gold_Interaction_876,yesterdays news when are the the criminals charges coming
Helpmepleaseohgodnoo,THIS JUST IN: they’re Nazis
Feisty-Summer9331,"Hey, is this adding to the pile? I’ve been consistently drunk from that game since 2021.
I’d like to go to bed now until any of this shit clings to the wall."
grosseelbabyghost,"Cool, now where's my tldr from the government?"
Strive--,"lol @ ""possible.""  We all heard the tape."
ChalkNAwe,Great. Now what?
Apes-Together_Strong,"So my 4 year, more smoking guns than I can remember, wait for an indictment is nearly over because this one is totally real? I won’t hold my breathe."
Blueplate1958,"In Georgia, when a grand jury is deliberating charges, how many people are on the grand jury and how many of them need to agree to charges?"
Blueplate1958,"Even if he is indicted tomorrow, there will be an extradition fight. Or the whole thing will be moot because he will have reached the end of his natural lifespan. But I think he will be convicted of one or two little meatballs, and down through the years, people will forget what he was all about. Most people think “Watergate” is all about a single break-in."
Smok3dSalmon,Can't the House fire all public employees now as part of the new rules? They'll just lay waste to any public sector employee that had a hand in this.
ComposerNate,I read headline: Georgia grand jury probing Trump for 2020 possible crimes
Key_Worth,[insert ‘well..we’re waiting’ gif here]
theFrankSpot,"I can’t help but think it’s never going to matter. Politicians in this country are so far above the law that they can get away with basically anything. There are few consequences — and pretty much never even a loss of office, and certainly not indictment, conviction, and jail time. And most have the voting population so in thrall — and SO afraid of the other side — that people would still vote for them if they were live-streaming themselves committing an actual crime during the vote."
