Jaksebar,"In my country, GOW Ragnarok costs 3 days of work for minimum wage and rates of people who earn minimum wage is significantly high

And you have to work 2 months without spending anything if you want to buy a ps5"
EdSGuard,"""The Gods of Olympus have abandoned me..."""
MageMasher_Online,If you can find a PS5 in Thailand it‚Äôs about 2-3 months salary worth
Blitbemander,More like God of I don't have a playstation. Lol but now it's on pc so I can play it.
KulaanDoDinok,Because I‚Äôm physically incapable of playing a sequel without playing the prior games
moosetwin,dude you just gotta rule 3
Urbane_One,"God (of War) I wish I could afford this game... or, like, any other games, ever. But this one in particular!"

creampie_420,"Haha, I am also poor"
FuriousGeorge50,"Honestly God of War series, Spiderman and Ghost of Tsushima were very worth the money paid"

1812_062006,ARRR become a pirate my friend and sail the internet.
Luke333_,God pf war 4 is on pc and possibly Ragnarok will be too in a while.
MechaGallade,i mean GoW 2018 is on steam now
RAIxYSA013,God of No Time
orangepolaa,"Same like you, even i also don't have any version of the play station."
CoffeeMaster000,Athena's not helping
Awesome_N22,I got mine off of eBay
WeToLo42,Not having trouble buying one just having trouble finding one to buy.
clearcolored_glasses,This made me laugh. I'm poor as shit too. Gamefly helps me play the games I can't afford.
TheRealDebaser,I almost bought God of War in the last steam sale for pc  but decided on Vacation Simulator 2 instead üòÇ
Irbricksceo,Thankfully it was on sale last steam sale so I finally have this game
milkywaybuddy,If you have decent internet you can stream it on PS Now on a PC
gigaswardblade,Binbogami?
FarInsurance8694,I have yet to play Ragnarok because my PS5 drive was damaged before it arrived üò©
maxsohigh00,I didn't expect this thread to be so sad
Funk_n_Friends,Okay I laughed. Happy?
yaosio,Between food and not being able to afford healthcare most people can't afford a console.
Hypervisory,More like I don't want a PlayStation - but I do want Kratos round two.
HeroLevel28,YouTube here i go
Ok-Tank5312, Puts god of war in my ps3
Feierskov,"I'm not poor, but I'm not going to buy a PlayStation just to play God of War, no matter how much I want to play it.  
I'm pretty sure I'll buy an Xbox this generation, even though I've always been a PlayStation owner. The price difference is just too big and I think Microsoft's services are just better."
ClozetSkeleton,Because I haven't played the first 3 games and I want to see them ported to PC first to understand the story and characters. Then I can play GoW and Ragnarock
monotoonz,"I've owned PS since its inception and haven't played a GoW game yet. A lot of fellow gamers ask me why and it's always the same answer. It's not my type of game. I have nothing against it whatsoever, but I like what I like."
240Nordey,Don't wanna buy a whole new system for Ragnarok. Will wait for a PC port.
RandomDudeinJapan,Cuz it's overrated
Apprehensive-Map519,"Or because it‚Äôs an overrated game? Repetitive, boring and backseated. 

Honestly, I don‚Äôt see what people see in this game. Played it for 1h58 minutes and got reimbursed on Steam. For sure it‚Äôs epic, but the gameplay is so poor. I prefer watching a movie or play a game with an actual original/fun gameplay."
bentsea,"It's totally on PC now, so instead of a whole 200$ PS4 you only need a 3500$ desktop."
ZookeepergameDue8501,"Plays really well on the PS4, if you can get a bargain for one of those"
RedThorns,I just got God of War for $10! Now Ragnarok on the other hand is $70 I‚Äôll be waiting several years before getting that one. Very much God of Poor.
rochestergeek,"
If I could beat Thor I would continue playing‚Ä¶."
alexefi,"it also not the type of game i enjoy.. recently met one of my old coworkers at party, and he just moved to PC gaming from PS4, so we added each other on steam. then he was like oh we have no games in common, i look at his games its mostly multiplayer FPS, while me mostly single player RPGs"
harrybalsania,"I‚Äôm just sick of feeling like ever major publisher and Hollywood writer has to have the friggin word Ragnarok in everything. Like Norse mythology is a cash cow but these companies are sucking it off instead of milking it. I got my Norse shit. Valheim is great, no need to spend money. Win all the way."
LilBussyGirl69,$70 bucks for a game is insane. I understand why they had to increase prices but god damn this hobby becoming way too expensive now. I got lucky that my cousin had the game and shared it with me. I wouldn't have been able to get it otherwise for a while
fanblade64,Old games are better just watch the cutscenes and you will get the same experience
dropTheBeef,"Lol, why? Just buy it instead of complaining."
Agent101g,Because I don‚Äôt want to play as a sociopath who burns a dude alive in a cage to solve a puzzle
Mikkelzen,no matter how much i loved the first new GOW for PS4 i will never buy a machine that is almost impossible to get in my country for one single video game. Release that shit on PC.
CiriLOVESGeralt,"Probably because its e mediocre Game. All PS Exclusive I played so fare were mediocre at best. What annoys me most about it that PS fanboys hype them up like they are these incredible Masterpieces, which they fucking aren't!."
JoganLC,No games means more time to better your finances. Lol I guess the downvotes mean you all would rather not have disposable income and just complain.
Cerberus_Kelevra,üòÜ
Flimsy-Calendar-6864,I feel that üòÇ
RYEman1075,I don‚Äôt have either lol
Dr4zhar,I surely won't buy a playstation just for that. I'd rather build a 10k nuclear-fueled PC so that it can run a ps5 emulator.
theShyning_,Same but with Ragnarok. I got lucky with winning a PS5 in a raffle a while ago but I can‚Äôt afford any games for it lol
maggos,I got GameCast
woganpuck,"Single player games go on sale several months after they're released. I'm in my thirties, so maybe this seems like a long time for the youngins, but at this point I think shit that happened a few months ago actually happened 7 years ago."
Bluewalker_BR,"I Will wait for a gow sale on steam. But Also... Man i would love If they release a god of war collection on Pc (since they are making Pc ports) and a bloodborne Port (i guess i Will die before i see Pc bloodborne with 60 fps). Maybe next year, because im 100% getting re4 remake First and dead space remake later."
PCGamerjunkie,lol whoever created this rinsed thereself
ImpartialHawk,"Funny, I saw a single PS5 at GameStop the other day. The *God of War* one, in fact. I told my wife we should trade our Xbox 360, Xbox One S, PS3, and *all* our games toward it. They probably wouldn't give us much, but we haven't played *any* of them in over a year. So they aren't doing anything for us, and having 3 consoles under the TV is just taking up space and collecting dust. And honestly those two Xbox consoles aren't worth a shit, anyway. 360 was awesome in its day, but it hasn't aged well, and XB1S was always shit tier (XB1/PS4 generation held back by hard drives, mostly; never had one, but I think PS4 was better?). As far as XBSX vs PS5, PS5 all the way. I'm a PC gamer though, so if I want the Xbox exclusives, I'll just get GamePass Ultimate. Then I got both. What do I need a Series X for? Sigh. I just wish the PS5 was black instead of white. That said, it's still prettier than a Series X. (Nothing against the Series X! My brother in law has one and it's a beast. I just don't see a reason to spend $500 on one when I can play its exclusives on PC, and put a PS5 under my TV for its exclusives, which *aren't* all on PC.)

Even without the trade, I could afford a PS5. Truth is, I really don't have that much time for gaming and my gaming PC suits my needs. The Xboxes are my wife's, and the PS3 is mine, and I only got it because a friend sold it to me for next to nothing. $150 for a 60GB phat with BC, and ten games? Couldn't pass it up. Haven't gotten my money's worth. Still don't care."
sh0rtb0x,Same reason I haven't played spiderman yet. It looks so amazing. I just don't think my laptop can handle it unfortunately.
,I have a ps4 but the plus membership gave me the first one for free
DelgadoTheRaat,r/pointlessredcircle
F_P-Actus,as opposed to the neolithic god of war?
Bworm98,It's on PC now.
LegiSLoth,the pic looks like there were a letter behind the R that just got cut out
BuffaloFrend,"I have just started playing Assassin's Creed for the first time. It's the second one, but I am playing it on the Ezio Colllection. It was only 40 USD and I have it in Switch."
JustAnotherLostYouth,"Just in case anyone was wondering as well, I did some research and it actually exists:

‚ÄúPENIA was the personified spirit (daimona) of poverty and need. She was a companion of Amekhania (Want of Rescource) and Ptokheia (Beggary). Her opposite number were Ploutos (Plutus) (Wealth) and Euthenia (Prosperity).‚Äù"
macetheface,"Just get the cheap Gamefly rental sub for like $9 a month.  Play as many games as you want; add a bunch to your queue and once you finish they cross ship out another one.  I used to look for deals, buy used games and then go through the hassle of trying to sell after but this is so much better.  If you play a bunch, can finish one every couple weeks.  So that's like $4.50 per game.

Can get any new game one month after it comes out too."
PWalshRetirementFund,God of PC
MingleLinx,It‚Äôs on PC if you have a PC
YoDavidPlays,ü§£ü§£ü§£
Deathstranger,Because currently working on the old games
Hogzor2,Be careful dude. I got permabanned for a similar post and got to appeal for a lift of the ban. This is border to piracy.
QueenCityRebel,at least the 2018(?) one is one steam but now i gotta wait for a while for ragnarok
sknnbones,"I refuse to play it because I worked on GoW3 and got royally fucked over by Sony so they could avoid having to hire me on directly from contract after my contract time limit was reached while the game was still in format/crunch.

Oh boy oh boy what do I get for working 8am to Midnight, 7 days a week for months straight?

Blacklisted from QA since all the gaming companies here used the same Contracting Company to hire QA/Game Test Analysts

You know who hired me after Sony? Walmart.

I went from Game Development to fucking Retail so Sony wouldn‚Äôt have to give me health insurance. And why not? Who wouldn‚Äôt want to work for SONY?? They have hoards of people waiting to get a job, they cycle through people like crazy."
Optimal_Sand_5329,You can sign up for PS plus and stream it on PC
MHWGamer,"playstation premium + or how it is called costs 16‚Ç¨ for an entire month and you can play many games. I did play GoW in November that way.
(Note that if you want to play other games, it might be necessary to buy a ps4 controller or do some wangle and emulate it with your xbox controller because many Playsi games forces you to use the touchpad at least once to progress (most actually, Gow works flawless).

Streaming quality is ""good"", of course a little bit of input lag - Bloodbourne was fine but with 30fps you don't notice it that much anyway, looks also good enough. Of course, playing Uncharted 4 a month later again in 4k on my PC is a world difference"
joogiee,Just an FYI you can play it for free (god of war) but you still need the playstation 4/5. Just gotta do ps plus ultimate trial and quickly finish it like i did lmaoo.
guywithknife,"Buy a Steam Deck

Or you know play on PC. But I‚Äôd use it as an excuse to get a steam deck! Ragnarok might take a while to come to PC though‚Ä¶"
ARIYA1388H,My mom and dad don't let me have PlayStation or xbox Even though I am 15 years old
K1NGCROW,"I have GOW Ragnarok, but I'm finishing my first playthrough of Dark Souls 1. I'm dying to play GOW tho"

MastermuffinDiscord,"Meanwhile, me: God of Bore"
nicholasgnames,"I want to play this but my son says he doesn't want to until we get a ps5.  I get it, but I don't want to wait lol"
OurFriendIrony,"Its on PC too, 20quid or less"
ThePaJomaster,My PS5 came in today and I'm hooked to Ragnarok
HistoricalShark,God of Bore
ge4020,"True, the real cost of playing it would include the additional sony tax on all other PS5 games, compared to PC or Xbox."
GERMA90,We need to stop buying these expensive games and wait for discounts or something. This is getting ridiculous. And don't let me start on Consoles and Pc.
dappernaut77,Because its on one system that I dont have nor want.
john-douh,"My thumb was hovering over my phone when I saw this‚Ä¶ so I read it as:

GOD OF POO"
