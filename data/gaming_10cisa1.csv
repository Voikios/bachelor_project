Ambartenen,AI is getting out of control! Now it’s not only faking a painting but also a ale person next to it to make it seem legit! The horror!

Drivingmecrazeh,"First off, I commend you on a very nice job done. Great painting. As for the critique, may I suggest a better quality canvas next time.  You can see the corner folded poorly in the upper left corner. They make better quality canvases that have a better fit and finish for such a nice piece of work."

Much respect to you, that's an incredible piece."
belaerixx,"I was having a bad day, glad I saw this! Your art is comforting in a way and I am so lucky that I came across it! I wonder what your other paintings are because it's to die for."
