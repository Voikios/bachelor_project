StigOfTheTrack,You're not the only one with a desk covered in pens and paper despite having 2 extra monitors that could be used for notes.
KalIsSatisfactorized,"I jot notes down all of the time while playing and/or planning, and always end up scanning them in. I enjoy the feel of a pencil in my hand, so I've been thinking about purchasing some type of digital drawing pad or tablet."
Khazorath,The number of hours I've spent doing math and planning outside the game is equal to my play time
MinaLamia,"I've taken notes for three games: satisfactory, stardew, and shadow empire.

Kind of weird they all start with S."
fulg_lover,May i see the notes?
sweetmozzarella,"Right there with you!

stilghar,"Same.
I just can't get used to any online tools (or Excel) for production planning. Pencil and paper are still my go to."
Recent_Log3779,"Same

I take notes and write out blueprints, I donâ€™t do this for any other game"
Celwynis,"I use signs in game for holding on to maths/ratios and road barriers for charting out building sizes/layouts.

Itâ€™s always interesting to see how everyone tackles the same problems differently"
Zynidiel,"Satisfactory: the game where you really play when working, taking a shower, drivingâ€¦"
nicolajmk,I prefer to use Excel. But definitely agree!
JayteeFromXbox,"I have way too much ADHD for notes, I just follow the old procrastinators trick of having two projects on the go at once so when I get tired of one I can procrastinate by working on the other."
guywth1mnth,"Same dawg, same"
EmberMelodica,"I built a nice belt flow spreadsheet I can refer to, but I still have a scratch pad on my desk for many satisfactory notes."
Huehnerschubbser,Welcome to the club :)
raknor88,I would do the same but lack desk space for a notebook. But Excel is a decent backup.
houghi,"I can not read my own notes often, so I make a webs page for my current project. [My WAR factory I am working on right now](https://houghi.org/satisfactory-mods-and-todo/ammo-and-stuff/)

I would not advice ti follow it, because there are some errors and I am aware of the changes I made here and there and they are not on that page."
Tethain,"I am thankful for not being to far in the game. And can still make all my notes inside my head. Once the time comes I have to write. I don't know if I will use pen and paper or something on my pc.

Also great notes. But where's your folder for all the notes?"
PepparPapper,Stardew Valley.
gutentom,This game and KSP for me!
YliHumala69,I even went and bought a notebook that is allready full of my notes and calculations
demonic_dagger15,On god
IRobot_Games,"There is another . . .












r/factorio"
Reasonable-Song-4681,This and No Man's Sky are the only games since classic Myst I've taken notes on.
Jb6534,"I love making notes for Satisfactory, also working out how much of something I need to feed a system using algebra finally gives said maths a use I don't find soul sucking ðŸ˜‚"
Outside_Database_182,"I've been playing it for a total of 320 hours and I literally have notebook full of plans, math, and production rates. Plus I have another server with some friends where we all building in different locations..... I'm going to need another notebook ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
Efficient_Spare_9808,"I guessed the game before finding charm and reading subreddit.


P.S. You're not alone, mate!"
AlexStarkiller20,Only notes i take are making never ending checklists in my notes app
TiberSeptimII,"You should try out The Witness! A notepad and pen is almost necessary for that game too, but for very different reasons."
Shadewolf69,"Teacher: Write me a 10,000 word essay on Satisfactory.
You: *passes with an A+++ with all those damn notes*"
sselesUssecnirP,I'd totally write notes if it didn't feel more comfortable alt tabbing and typing on my keyboard.
Sack0fWoe,Fez has been the only game to make me write physical notes. I can't type in their language.
ATrueGhost,Y'all know their factory planners out there. I just add what I want to make and tweek output and alternative recipes till I have enough resources for it.
Badger897,I have an entire spiral notebook just for this game lol.
ZoidsGhost,I love drawing diagrams to figure out my machine set up before starting work on a new factory.
lukyth1rt3en,"I always keep the notepad and calculator apps open on my second monitor. The notepad files called ""Best Layed Planes"" which represents how I always screw up the first time I set up a new factories in/out ratios"
SnooRevelations1021,Phases 4 is almost done and i took 0 notes and made 0 math am i the only one ?
Zomey256,I'm doing that as well. What puzzles me is that none of these recipes are alternate recipes. Do you really only use the default ones?
Feedzalot,"My desk looks almost the same. Game on middle screen, the map with my uploaded save on the right one, notes and colored pens all around it."
wivaca,What are those long cylindrical things and those white rectangles.  I use a spreadsheet.
Hell_Diguner,Let me save you hours and hours of time: https://factoriolab.github.io/satisfactory
D_is_for_Doomsayer,Satisfactory is an excuse for me to make more spreadsheets.
Different-Raise3680,You have 3 monitors. Use notepad or word or excel
Beneficial-Virus1397,"Monica:  
You wanna talk about notes? You wanna talk about notes? Okay! Iâ€™ve stumbled onto a major Ficsit conspiracy Beck, how's that for notes?  
Becky:  
What the hell are you talking about?  
Monica:  
This companyâ€™s efficiency is being sapped like unbalanced inputs Becky, and I got a data trail to prove it. Check this out, take a look at this. These right there are the collectables. Now let's talk about the collectables. Can we talk about the collectibles please, Beck? I've been dying to talk about the collectables with you all day, okay? Power Slugs, these things keep poppin' up over and over and over again. Every day power slugs keep clogging the AWESOME sink. Yellow power slugs, purple power slugs, I look next to the sink, this whole container is power slugs! So I say to myself I gotta find their recipe. I gotta go down to the workshop, I gotta craft the slugs by goddamn hand. Otherwise theyâ€™re never gonna get processed, theyâ€™re gonna keep coming back to the sink. So I go to the workshop and what do I find out, Beck, what do I find out? There is no use for power slugs. The recipe does not exist, okay? So I decided, ohh shit, girl, I gotta dig a little deeper. There's no power slug recipe, you gotta be kidding me, I got a container full of slugs. All right, so I start marching my way down to the MAM in the HUB and Iâ€™m walking down the catwalk and I say, ""Aaaada, Aaaada! I gotta scan these power slugs!"" And when I go in the door, what do I find? There's not a single goddamn scanner in that building. There is no MAM in the HUB. Becky, half the pioneers in this factory have been made up. This planet is a goddamn ghost town.  
Becky:  
Okay Monica, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Not only has the MAM been made into a separate building since update 3, but you donâ€™t craft powershards at the workshop. We need them for overclocking. Efficiencyâ€™s sake, dude. We are gonna lose our jobs.  
Monica:  
Well calm down, 'cause here's one thing that's not gonna happen. We're not gonna get terminated. 'Cause we've already been terminated.  
Becky:  
Weâ€™ve lost our jobs!?  
Monica:  
Yeah. About three days ago, a couple termination packets came via the delivery drone. One for you, one for me. So what did I do? I stuffed them in the space elevator and sent them into orbit.  
Becky :  
If weâ€™ve lost our jobs, that means weâ€™ve lost our cloning allotment. Which means we can die for good on this planet. Clogged throughput dude, I am having a panic attack. I am actually having a panic attack.  
Monica:  
Would you settle down and have another cup of coffee?  
Becky:  
I am, girl.  
Monica:  
Alright, well fine. You know what Steve, get the woman a medical inhaler. Sheâ€™s freaking out.  
Becky:  
Huh? Who?  
Monica:  
Steve, heâ€™s the CEOâ€™s overworked assistant.  
Becky:  
Steve? Who the unbalance is Steve?  
Monica:  
You donâ€™t see S... oh shit. Where the hell did he..?  
Becky:  
Youâ€™ve blown a fuse. Youâ€™ve tripped your mindâ€™s main breaker, Monica."

El_Tewksbury,I used a dry erase board that is next to my computer... It's great
monkeypan,I haven't played the game in a while and don't know where my spreadsheets ended up after the ssd died. I'm going to have lots of notes in my future to figure out where I left off
MadmazeF,"I've started Excel planning for optimizing the balancing of my factories, but also did so. many. drawings! Lately more for the general organization / aesthetic of a new building."
Dnaldon,"Use your pc mate, no reason to waste paper."
s1mmel,"I don't need paper anymore, I switched to MIRO. I use it anyways and the canvas is so big, I can write down anything I want, from crunching numbers or writing down calculations, even screenshot yt videos and link them, if I need advice on a topic. I started this a few months ago and tbh I'm not going back to paper. I can look it up from everywhere, so neat."
elluSs,"I use my tablet with a Samsung pen. I find it much better as I can erase, move, resize my notes so much easier. I went from having to flip through pages to find the notes I was looking for to just having a couple screens of notes I can swipe back and forth on. Using the pen feels like writing but I still get the benefits of using the tablet. Game changer for me."
