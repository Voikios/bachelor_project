Peetypingu_ult,"I came from Hunt Showdown. Thought about getting Tarkov, yet decided to pick up this game instead with the impression that it’s Tarkov Lite"
Dubleron,One does not play Tarkov... Tarkov plays you.
swboos21,"I play hunt, tarkov, and marauders"
LingromR,"Came from tarkov here, haven't touched grass in 70 years (since marauders alpha). closest I got was in queue after tarkovs last wipe. Sat for 10min and closed it to launch marauders again"
MattMurdockEsq,"Yeah, sort of.  I played Tarkov for about 15-20 hours over the course of three weeks.  Realized I would have to pretty much only play Tarkov if I wanted to get actual progress done.  Then I got killed by a hacker, and decided to hang it up.  Now, I just play STP-AKI when I want to play Tarkov.  Much more enjoyable."
OkChildhood2261,Yeah Tarkov refugee here.
SluMpKING1337,Came here from Tarkov actually.
Tallox555,Came here from tarkov actually
Grillman,I used to play tarkov. I haven't played them in the same time period. Thinking about playing tarkov again but not sure I want the pain lol
hauntedcorpse,I’ve been interested in Tarkov for quite a while but decided to try Marauders since it’s simpler. However that simplicity will probably make me transfer over to Tarkov once I get bored.
DiabloHelios,I flip flop between the both. I come here when I get sick of the noodle arm aim model in Tarkov. Lot easier to get my friends going in some quick vault runs too.
OverlordZombwich,"The majority of players are either coming from Tarky or were looking at Tarky and thought this looked better.   


Me personally, I love the aesthetic of this game way more than what Tarkov is going for."
Goalie2315,"I played tarkov for a while, mostly towards the end of High School and college, then I graduated, got a real job, decided I didn’t want the second full time job of playing tarkov and switched to Marauders. 

Side note, saying this made me remember just how long Tarkov has been in development."
SamuelCish,"My brother bought Tarkov and was banned before he logged in for the first time. Customer service never got back to him and he wasn't able to find help online. I made a post about it on the Tarkov sub and was immediately swarmed with comments accusing him of having cheats on his computer. No way that kid has cheats, he's ass, I've seen him play games.

But I've been hesitant to buy Tarkov in case that shit happens to me."
Count_Von_Bonke,"Played em all - Tarkov, Hunt, Marauders, DMZ, Cycle. Marauders is the only one I come back to, but only because I got some peeps to play with tbh."
mEDWARDetector,Currently level 11 in the current Tarkov wipe typically getting destroyed when fighting other real players but am continuing to push through quests as much as I can. Hoping to get a good understanding of Tarkov this wipe. Haven’t played mauraders in like 2 months but enjoyed it. Just waiting for bigger patches and stuff.
blassin_em_hoze,I play Marauders and Tarkov. At the same time.
domogasm,Yes
T_happy2,"love tarkov but you don’t play it, it’s just a full time job"
actuallizardperson,i broke my legs a lot this wipe thanks to marauders
Longjumping_Water_74,"I love the art design and overall atmosphere of Marauders, its refreshing and the lore is pretty interesting. I like the realism and complexity of Tarkov, I just hate waiting between 5-15 min every time I wanna play it. It hs always been a deal breaker for me, which is sad considering that I love everything else about Tarkov. It could be my favorite game if the matchmakings werent so long. I guess Im gonna wait for Stalker 2 to come out and see if its my ultimate dream game."
Senpatty,"I played Tarkov last wipe, was just too many systems for me to really enjoy my time with it. I feel like Marauders takes the meat and potatoes of Tarkov and leaves out the extra stuff. 

Now I would still kill for a pirate hideout to dump my money in, but crafting recipes is a good replacement for that money sink IMO"
lordrages,"Yes. Honestly, wait on Tarkov. It’s in a very bad spot currently.

Lots of major gameplay issues that probably aren’t going to be fixed until the next wipe."
Morgan1100,"I'd say the majority came from Tarkov, yes"
,already quitted eft again this wipe. too tedious and unbalanced. Marauders and Hunt do a better job here
Conmanjames,"used too, giving it (and my anxiety) a break since its hard to find solid teammates in that game. Marauders feels much more relaxed than tarkov."
Sword117,ive escaped in recent days
Adm1ral_ackbar,"Hunt showdown was my main game for a long time; I dabbled in Tarkov and it's kind of like Marauders except not fun. 

Tarkov just goes out of it's way to be unfriendly and esoteric to the player. Everything from no map, rotating extraction points with no clear indication, the extreme grindiness... It's just a misery simulator."
YaBoyEvit,I tried. I didn't like it.
paralax5151,"I came mostly from hunt showdown, although I have played Tarkov. I try tarkov each wipe but each time I am not impressed , that game needs so much to happen to be good IMO."
Gebatron,"I really like Tarkov. But there’s just so much going on. The sheer amount of items makes it overwhelming to know what’s what. The maps are also difficult to navigate and learn meaning you’ll die a few time from just not knowing what’s where. All that coupled with the depth of all the different systems makes it a daunting task even when you do start getting the hang of it. Like right now my character is getting worse just because I’m not playing. I’m being punished for not playing. I really like it, but it has serious investment obligations to play let alone get good. Marauders still has plenty to learn and master but it can be done at a more leisurely pace. I’m glad I play both, but usually find myself having more fun, more consistently with Marauders."

JackpotJosh7,"I do. Both are fun for me. Tarkov definitely has more depth and hardcore gameplay, but it’s nice to be a bit more casual with Marauders."
GhettoKroenen,"Never tried Tarkov. A couple friends of mine who used to play it recommended to our friend group that we try Marauders instead since it doesn’t take a lifetime to learn. We did play a lot of Hunt Showdown, which was super fun, but not nearly as hardcore as Tarkov (from what I’ve heard at least)."
Kullet_Bing,"Played tarkov since closed alpha until like 2 years ago. The constant hacker deaths or desync deaths eventually got me so tired of the game that I couldn't be bothered anymore. Sat in my stash screen looking at my gear and not wanting to equip anything or chosing a map / quest so I closed it one day and not touching it since. 

Marauders just feels so much better to play in every regard. Its an amazing game gameplay wise, just needs some more content and soem fixes here and there and its perfect."
CnD123,"Tarkov vet, bought marauders and put in 40 hours. Its alright.

Now back to Tarkov"
Obiss1231,"Been enjoying some tarkov with wipe, but marauders when it has a little more content would prob be my go to over tarky."
Undecided_Username_,"I left tarkov. Found hunt this and dark and darker. 

I’m happier."
SnooSongs9216,"I came from EFT to Marauders. Marauders seems like a game more for people who don't have the time to spend learning the MASSIVE maps in EFT, and it seems like going broke to rich is much easier in this game compared to Tarkov. but hey, maybe the devs make it overly complicated just like tarkov eventually lmao hopefully not"
