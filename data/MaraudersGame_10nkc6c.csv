w1gster,They didnâ€™t nerf the damage according to the patch did they?
iSellPopcorn,"The terminator could one shot by vaguely aiming towards the head from 25 feet away, it was overpowered

The liberator shot litteral peas at your enemy, it was underpowered

They had no reason to touch the trench gun

And I don't know about the jackhammer"
some_random_nonsense,"The nerfs were fucking stupid. I hate every time shotguns are good in game they get nerfed to kissing distance. back to rising storm i guess.

yeh the terminator was a problem but it mostly could have been fixed with economy. 1 high grade and sheet was too cheap. 

Trench gun is a rare weapon only in drops why did that have to get nerfd?"
Maybedeadbynow,"They nerfed the hell out of shotguns...I get it when you could kill somebody from far away, but up close...come on! I can't even kill bots point-blank with sawed off shotty :/"
Herr_von_Stein,Wow they added confetti shells? Nice gonna test it soon
TheRealGenki,I understand why the terminator needs the nerf but this is too much bruh
SouthFLJay,I got into a gunfight with a trench gun user and he blasted me 3 times at maybe 10 meters and after I killed him I only had maybe 30% of my health missing.
Think-Independent-34,"I'd be okay with them adding shotgun chokes to the game so the trenchgun and Terminator can be their former selves. Maybe as a rare supply drop item. Or special hot shotty ammo type and a reinforced metal barrel. If you didn't have the reinforced barrel the gun would just explode randomly in the first 5 shots lol l. 

The terminator maybe needed a materials nerf. The gun put you at an extreme disadvantage, I'd constantly have to switch to my sidearm to clean things up (which is tough when you have to rack a round every time the character pulls out a weapon). It's really a shame. It's not like it was the AWP in CSS or something. It required accuracy and calm. If you had full hp and decent armor 1 shot wouldn't kill unless it was a direct headshot close up. 

This is just a huge bummer. I loved this game cause all my friends who were mediocre at shooters (my genre) would actually play it with me cause there's limited to no sniping. They can handle close quarters, and I'm a wizard with a shotgun... So this was just the perfect mix for me... It's gonna be hard booting up now. I was stoked we found a game where I can shotgun and my friends can spray and pray. 

I'll have to go back to insurgency for my shotty fix :(

There's no reason for a shotgun pattern to be this garbage so close. With a modified choke you can accurately land a 1ft buckshot pattern around 50 yards.

Nerf the terminator, leave the trench gun alone! Lol

I'm sure there's a bunch of people who are super stoked these guns are obsolete."
Plastic-Ad-503,And the game has never felt better
Complete_Bagel,"I have noticed this with all shotguns, and to some degree all guns. Inconsistently hitting where they should, either desync or so weird collision issue. I dunno."
HelmutIV,You shot him in the arms twice. Aim better bro.
