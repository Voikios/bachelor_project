Practical-Fly-5097,"This world be amazing if the map was bigger.  It might seem large, and it is, but mid-late game it gets very small.  This seems fun for a larger map where you have to go hunting farther distances to make the power and crafting worty it."
EidolonRook,"I know that’s supposed to be a car/small tank sized vehicle, but it honestly gave me homeworld desert of kharak vibes. https://youtu.be/n1yrFE9FfrA"
Saaihead,"Won't happen anytime soon. Not because of the idea itself (which is great!), but because CSS is focusing on 1.0 now and I don't expect them to add big content updates anymore. And I agree with them, because it's time to finish the game itself now. New stuff can be added later on in an update after 1.0, or maybe even 2.0. But please post it on the Q&A, I'll upvote! :)"
Terrible__Pickle,"Ok, but it runs on Plutonium ☢️"
_Ol_Greg,"I'm still holding out for Ficsit dirtbikes.

I NEEEED IT"
EngineerInTheMachine,Best place to post this is on the Satisfactory Q&A site. The devs see everything on there.
Belazael,Just gimme the Mako from Mass Effect 1 and I’ll be fine. Doesn’t even need the gun.
AnOlympianWeeb,I still think that an end game aircraft would be amazing
therobotisjames,With machine guns and missiles and hookers and blackjack.
GaffJuran,That would be nice if I had any confidence that they could make a wheeled vehicle that could deal with the terrain in any way. I’d rather have a hovercraft or a helicopter/flying carrier.
Rabbitmincer,"Other than power generation, I don't see how this is significantly different than the Explorer."
GOLD_CAT_GER,I want this
aza-industries,No more cars.. Give us a hoverbike that can go fast.
cheztir,"I love the idea of letting a vehicle serve as a mobile generator, better than building biomass gens just to grab hard drives.

As for crafting are you talking automated or something more than the craft bench already built into the vehicles?"
legion_2k,Always thought a motorcycle would be epic.
mackzorro,Petition to have the Mako with the exact same physics from ME1 instead of this batman tumbler
doktortaru,You can craft from any vehicle
meddleman,"""We have a tumbler at home.""  

The tumbler at home:  

_places construction-vehicle light on roof_"
Hewatza,They should just add these features to the Cyberwagon
Whaim,"To be honest the vehicle balance with respect to pacing in terms of unlock progression and build complexity in this game does feel a bit off.

A car like the one way down in the (caterium?) mam tree should be much sooner, maybe even before trucks.  

Also, the terrain is fairly vehicle unfriendly throughout most of the world.  It’s only when you finally get trains that the world really opens up, and that’s only after a LOT of time laying tracks.

Adding an intermediate step like this before trains but when you want to explore could be nice, but this game just has too much verticality for most vehicles to really feel useful.  That’s why trains shine, you can create your own slopes or just fly above the ground wherever."
PastelSkunk,Really doubt that the official devs will do this. You could reach out to the modding community maybe.
iemgus,And it should be able to pull trailer(s) which can also jump. For all terrain jumping road trains.
eee170,#&($ing yes
Mastermaze,Make something like also able to partly fly and this would truly the Spidertron of Satistfactory
Vancity_turtle,I would love to see this game fuse with subnautica. Hollllllly shit. Just imagine....
securitywyrm,I'll take a grapple gun and glider cape thank you.
FreshPitch6026,"The devs themselves said that the vehicle system and physics is still kinda wonky at the moment. They plan to rework vehicles a bit, but at least as long as they haven't worked on it they dont want to add vehicles."
ElliottCoe,Make it amphibious too!
Lolaniway07,Yes please. Maybe smaller than that would be perfect
Merrine,hnnnnnngh
Ash3000k,"Great idea, i hope they see this!"
synalx,"Yessss

Give the explorer rockets to ""hop"", that burn through turbofuel from its inventory."
CatFish21sm,"This is a pretty cool idea. But by the time you would unlock it you would no longer have any need for it. Perhaps it could replace the explorer. Or be an explorer upgrade that you unlock alongside the truck. However, I personally agree with other comments below. I'd much prefer a smaller vehicle. Perhaps a drone. That could follow you and act as extra storage. Something that you can send back to your base to load or unload maternials. That wuld be so helpful with building new factories. 

Personally the blueprint scanner and explorer does almost everything I'd like from this thing. I'd like the explorer to be a little more stable on rough terrain, and have a larger cargo hold. But it has more than enough, and with the blueprint scanner I can easily plop down a starter facroty wherever I need it. Two or three biofuel burners is really all you need to start a factory. 

Fine a nearby water source and some coal or oil and hook up some biofuel burners to get the machines started then let them power everything else as you scale up from there.   


If need be I have a blueprint capable of prodicung iron rods, plates, and reinforced plated from just one biofuel burner. I just hook that up and let it run, that gives me everything I need to start building my power source.  I need fewer than 10 inventory slots to start a new factory. After it gets established just refill and repeat. 

That being said If I could send a drone back and forth to my base, to resupply me with materials occasionally I oculd just plop down a factory and move to the next node. Easy peasy."
Sensitive_Cash_2803,Skin maybe?
andocromn,It'd be amazing but I don't think it's ever gonna happen
EldridgeHorror,I like the idea of a vehicle that you can draw power from. Functionally no worse than throwing up a biomass burner to get a hard drive.
Snypi_PL,"Petitions are for morons !

Devs stated they don't plan any more vehicles."
