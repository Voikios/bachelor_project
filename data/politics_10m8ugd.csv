Jaded_Prompt_15,Because there might actually be consequences for signing a false affidavit
Capable-Rutabaga5877,"Because Alito did it. Making a Supreme Court Justice lie on an official document would look bad for Roberts when nothing happened to Alito.

So sweep it under the rug and pray it leaves the news cycle before anyone can grab a hold of it."
Jedi-El1823,"Spoiler, because Alito or Thomas leaked it to lock in Kavanaugh."
Bonethgz,"Nothing will change at SCOTUS until there’s an ethics code or committee or something. They’re not accountable to fucking ANYONE. They’ve taken it upon themselves to legislate from the bench. 

The Supreme Court is rotten. It needs to be reformed in a major, major way."
Epistatious,"So if the staff all signed a affidavit saying it wasn't them, we know its ~~Alito~~ one of the justices?"
Warglebargle2077,Because it was Alito.
HectorsMascara,"I was told the leak “was a grave betrayal of trust by somebody ... a shock, because nothing like that had happened in the past. It certainly changed the atmosphere at the court for the remainder of last term.”

“The leak also made those of us who were thought to be in the majority in support of overruling Roe and Casey targets for assassination because it gave people a rational reason to think they could prevent that from happening by killing one of us,"" Alito exclaimed."
MonkeyDeltaFoxtrot,We all know fucking Alito leaked it. It’s really not that hard to figure out.
So_spoke_the_wizard,The liberal judges should have volunteered to sign affidavits (assuming they had no involvement or knowledge) just to put pressure on the Republican judges.
DonTaddeo,It's simple. Some people are more equal than others.
RedmannBarry,Because corruption
overit_fornow,So the lying Republiklans in the House should investigate the lying Republiklans in the Supreme Court? Good luck with that.
EivorIsle,"Oh look, Dopey, Drunky, and Stolen Seat."
Eye_foran_Eye,"When those that decide the legality of the laws of the land think they are above the law, you have a BIG problem."
silverbeat33,I know why. Corrupt motherfuckers.
Jeffreyknows,Everyone in this picture sucks!
sunnydaysahead2022,"If the investigation wasn’t independent, there wasn’t an investigation."
cronic_chaos,Because they’re crooked af
Cuck-In-Chief,SCOTUS is corrupt. Trump has defiled it. Kennedy sealed the deal and sold its soul.
wretched-knave,Why are these people exalted as living gods?
Iamaleafinthewind,"It rhymes with ""Rules for thee,"""
Frankenmuppet,Rules for thee but not for me
2big_2fail,*The Untouchables.*
Jolly_Grocery329,Who ever thought SCOTUS would be such a wreck.. I mean - they’ve had their issues but this one is a whole other level of shitheadery
voyagerdoge,"Huh? Doesn't Congress know these justices belong to the one-rule-for-them, one-rule-for-us club, just like the GOP? They're the executive office of the GOP policy department after all."
athornton79,"Everyone already KNOWS why. One of the justices themselves was the leak. One of the Conservative justices leaked the draft opinion early to force the others to ""stay on target"". If it was leaked and they flipped, they'd catch hell from the people who have been paying their cushy little bribes and ""talks"" they so generously get paid to give. 

Once it was out, they had no choice but to go through with it or face serious backlash from their own. And it'd hurt their real agenda: their own pockets. 

So of course they didn't require ANY justice to sign anything - anyone who scratches below the extreme surface would discover the truth and then they'd have the justice lying under oath. Not that the GOP would care, but the public 'might'."
Experienced_AP,"This entire SCOTUS needs to be purged (impeached) with a few exceptions.

I'll settle for nullifying the Trump appointees."
karlmarxsbootybutt,It was Alito. Why the fuck are they even investigating this? We all know it was the dude that has a track record of leaking shit in this exact manner.
Tagurit298,They leaked it.  They wanted it out first before they voted so people knew what direction they would go.  Get the anger out now instead of when they voted on it
deusirae1,OMG this stacked court are just a complete train wreck. Imagine this group possibly sitting for 20-30 years together.
DavidGlennCox,That's because that's the way Fascists operate. It's the Fuhrer principle. The people in charge are above reproach while everyone else below is under suspicion.
Mortar_Maggot,Can't find constitutional grounds to impeach a judge if you never investigate them!
Comprehensive_Fox739,"just sayin, if Trump appointed you, you're a crook."
Tristain7,"It was very obviously Alito, and the conservatives just wanted SOME level of deniability and cover.

Investigations aren't going to do anything, the Court is quite literally untouchable right now and they know it.  Theocracy is what the GOP wanted, and it's what we're all going to have to suffer under or fight our way out of."
Full-Cake-8071,"I predict the public at large will reject this SCOTUS more and more over time, which will force changes like term limits. I think the short-term win by the GOP nominations will blow up in their faces because most people do not like what is going on."
RDO_Desmond,Nine lawyers who can't find a leak are not real lawyers!
KirasMom2022,"IMHO, the leaker was probably John Roberts himself. That is why “the leaker” hasn’t been “found”. If it wasn’t sanctioned by him, heads would have rolled… and that hasn’t happened. It is being swept under the carpet."
KeepFaithOutPolitics,“Checks and balances” is a fucking joke.
theamoeba,"Because they’re above the law, or so they believe anyway…"
tazebot,[Alito leaked the Hobbylobby decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/us/supreme-court-leak-abortion-roe-wade.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare&fbclid=IwAR1ZvWtEQW2qeq62T1Ag6vC9NkhuygKQU7kCyr6-_b_RnLjnSZfZ_5a5SOs) so no wonder he at least doesn't want to sigh affidavits.
P0pu1arBr0ws3r,Can someone give me a list of every scandalous thing and investigation going on or that has gone on in the past year related to any part of the federal government?
canon12,"Do you will think that McCarthy would permit an investigation when a Republican is the subject of an investigation.  However, he can be bullied into anything."
Bryaxis,"BOLD STATEMENT, says ""a group""."
FUMFVR,Doesn't sound like good behavior to me. Shitcan them.
,Because Alito leaked it.
Loreki,"An affidavit is the written equivalent of testifying under oath. If the Justices had signed them and it turned out that it *was* one of them, we would have had the spectacle of having a senior judge being put on trial for perjury, as well impeachment for negligence in office.

That's not only a problem for that Justice or a problem for what little credibility the court has left. That's a problem for the credibility of every institution of the federal government.

They can't have the miserable political illegitimacy of the Supreme Court spreading."
poopingonariver,The Supreme Court doesn’t represent the people of America. Could someone outside of this totalitarian Orwellian nightmare kindly dismantle our government please and thank you.
oldwedgie,Don't protect these religious fanatics in the Supreme Court. Leak them from every angle.
sandman795,I really don't understand why the leak matters in the first place? Anyone care to explain?
elconquistador1985,"The reason why is that one of them did it, and they don't want that to come out so they deliberately hampered the investigation."
Pixelodo,Why does anyone care about a leak… care about them destroying the country more…
Enthused_Llama,Super wild how the people at the top aren't treated equally under the law.
hiperson134,I can tell you why. We don't need an investigation to ask why. Everyone knows why.
Bingohead,Buzz feed growing up
GringottsWizardBank,Why? We know why. Our political officials have no accountability. The concept is simply out of fashion in the US. We are really operating on bottom of the barrel personnel.
jackspayed,"Start with the on the record testimony of . Rev Robert Schenck on December 8, 2022 to the judiciary committee: 

(On corrupting the courts)”I had written it principally out of a concern that a court subordinate would unfairly take the blame for the Dobbs leak suffering draconian punishment yet I knew a Justice would face no consequences for such a breach. “ - Operation Higher Court

Video: https://youtu.be/qA8Tmn56Lt8
Written Testimony: https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20221208/115220/HHRG-117-JU00-Wstate-SchenckR-20221208.pdf"
Healthy-Swim-990,Because the justices don’t want to self-incriminate.
Kantsas,It's astounding how the people who should be held to the highest standards have no standards at all.  They can do anything they like and get away with it.
Donut131313,Good luck. Like congress will actually investigate anything that might have really happened.
vegetaman,So who are the snowflakes now?
frankenfork123,Why do we put other humans on a pedestal? They are still subject to the same seduction of corruption.
Old_Cheesecake_5481,"The Trumpy Supreme Court is fully corrupted.  

The Americans have full fledged third world style corruption on the SC."
jersey_viking,"“Until recently, Schenck ran a 20-year campaign he called Operation Higher Court through which he recruited wealthy donors to befriend and influence conservative justices. These donors, called “stealth missionaries,” were instructed to strengthen the beliefs of justices who “shared our conservative social and religious sensibilities” through private dinners, prayer circles, and vacations.”   

Stealth Missionaries? With stacks of conservative wealth behind them? Secret dinners to advance ‘paid to review’ issues? And now, SCROTUS, is accidentally leaking documents that magically becomes near-irreversible Law?    


There’s nothing to see here, move along."
SamuraiJackBauer,"America is ruled by a council of kings. 

SCOTUS is the most anti-freedom/liberty/murica body in existence and they somehow have the loyalty of those they actively seek to destroy. 

The USA is a weird ass place for the 21st Century"
RequalsC0m,Republicans are a communist cult. They believe that elites should have all the power be unelected and not have to face questions from the peasants.
cbarone1,"Surely it's just a coincidence that the ""investigation"" took exactly as long as it took for Republicans to gain control of the House and it's investigative powers!"
confusedblues,"So is the concern here more about finding out who leaked it, or scrutinizing how the investigation into the leak was handled?

I'm curious, too, if a leak like this is something criminal, or just unethical. Overall, to me, the leak itself didn't really feel like a big deal, and maybe there should be some public scrutiny an SC decisions like this before they happen.

The Supreme Court institution as a whole, including the nomination process, has proven to be far from some kind of bipartisan ethical ""blind justice"" ideal."
alien_from_Europa,Can someone please go wake up Merrick Garland?
JohnnyGFX,Alito was the leak. It isn't the first time. It probably won't be the last.
T_Weezy,"It's because Alito himself was probably the leaker.  And the Court *really* doesn't want to admit that, especially when confidence in them is already historically low."
mjl0248,I bet it’s because one of them is the lesser of information..  LOL
Lank42075,They will not they are above the law…Rules for thee but not me is the mantra…
Radiant-Call6505,"Way, way too much privilege and too little accountability. Something must be done to stop the abuse of political power by these justices."
klyzklyz,"Power corrupts.
Absolute power corrupts, absolutely."
ResoluteClover,"And then it turns out they leaked it... And literally nothing happens as a result.  

Asking for a friend, if a supreme court justice kills someone, can they be held accountable outside of Congressional oversight?"
Friblisher,"No, that's fine"
s4burf,And moron Roberts whines about lack if respect for his stacked partisan court.
trent58,"I mean, does it matter, after “it’s settled law”? Might as well ask George Santos to be truthful."
lactose_cow,"Just fucking say it.  Say ""I did the leak, what are ya gonna do about it?""

The answer is nothing, but at least we save a few taxpayer dollars."
Appropriate_Chart_23,"Our system is great, but it only works if those at the top of each government branch aren’t corrupt. 

It’s our version of democracy’s biggest flaw.

It’s an honorable system made for honorable people. And, we don’t have honorable people in the government."
PositivelyIndiana,A bunch of Catholics lied? That can't be right
ting_bu_dong,">Congress is being urged to investigate why.

""We have concluded that not everyone is equal under law.  This is working as intended."""
XiXyness,Democrats should of done this before they lost the house why now?
SoggyFlakes4US,They are a gang of corrupt religious extremists that have no place in a court of law. They are an absolute joke on democracy. It is outlandish that their word is the law of the land in a free country.
Schiffy94,Because it was planned and greenlit by Roberts I don't get why this is so hard to understand.
OlderThanMyParents,"There’s a whole lot of pearl clutching going on over this, and I really don’t understand why. Leaks are naughty, sure. But so what? It’s not like there’s a code of behavior the SC is required to uphold. If it turned out that the decision was leaked by a justice, so what? Is congress going to impeach them? Would the senate vote to convict? It’s just a big drama party with everyone accusing everyone else and none of it means anything. Its all just theatrics at this point."
muttonbarley,Does anyone care about this leak? Why shouldn't that sort of information be out in the open?
ImDirt66,"I was wondering why the only talked with the active judges and staffs and not ex Justice Breyer who retired right after the leak. Breyer was a leftist Democrat who's staffer was a radical abortion proponent and who's husband is best friends with the reporter who broke the story.   Ahh, probably just a coincidence."
officegeek,Because they're the fix that's in.  The most significant thing congress will investigate is hunter bidens cock and they'll impeach joe for it
TaoLorena,Fuck the SC
ChattyMan2016,DUH - Because they’re above the law.
xafimrev2,"I mean, the staffers weren't ""required"" to sign an affidavit.   They were asked to."
Firm_Masterpiece_343,A congress we have no faith in investigating the Supreme Court which we have no faith in.
SkyriderRJM,Because our system of checks and balances only functions if the other branches choose to responsibly put politics aside and check and balance.
CertainAged-Lady,"Pretty sure we all know it was Alito.  I mean, seriously, his own dinner companion already outed him for giving him & his organization sneak peaks at opinions prior AND Alito has steamrolled over the court norms in the past years.  It’s just my opinion, but he has SO much smoke you have to wonder if the fire is nearby."
workingtheories,"yo, A Group said that??  fr?  wow"
BrownEggs93,Congress?  The congress with republicans in it?  Fat fucking chance.
Batmobile123,Can I take one guess?
KantPaine,"It’s simple, they think they’re above the law."
BacktoTralfamadore,"Yes, the Republican House will be diligent on this!"
joshdoereddit,"Man, must be nice to have a job where you are completely untouchable like these fuckers."
reynoldsunbound1937,"This is practically theocratic, the dark-robed priests who serve for life aren’t accountable to anyone else."
Epona44,That IS an interesting question.
frogking,I think it’s pretty obvious “why”..
gump82,That is because the supremely supreme imperial majestic rulers of the Supreme Court are above the law! They are just better than all of us and we need to accept there demands and laws or face the corrupt corporate jail and military police! Our place is just under foot where we belong. It’s ok they have our best interest at heart!
thebunk123,“A Group” is the new “We Live in a Society”
mymar101,The guy that was most upset was your leaker
Reflex_Teh,Nothing will happen since republicans control the house.
buried_lede,"It was Alito, duh."
RorschachShaman,"Oh IDK, maybe because our Fking government is just corrupt, money-hungry, soul-sucking leeches that will never hold themselves accountable..."
waitsfieldjon,Simply because they knew it was one of their own.  They didn't want Sam to have to purger himself.
WaitingFor45sArrest,Justice Raper isn’t vindictive at all
Radio-Dry,"I *AM* THE LAW!

Judge Alito."
poopiopeepio,Bad people
Swimrf, there might actually be consequences for signing a false affidavit.
jajajajaj,"I really don't understand what it's supposed to mean to ""leak"" a supreme court decision. As far as I can tell, it's like leaking a weather report. Knowing about it early is fine, and even if you contain it, everyone will find out soon enough."
briantcox81,Alito bird told me
TornadoesArentReal,Remember when all Conservatives wanted to talk about is how bad we should punish this leaker?
Wolverine-75009,https://steady.substack.com/p/a-supreme-mess?utm_source=direct&r=elei6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&fbclid=IwAR21JLR1myqABYm9b_hwrufzO94dkAJvQb5eLjksLevMR8annkMS9J8FURk
BLF402,Is it just me but I really suspect it was alito who leaked it
Silly_Pace,A supreme court justices wife was involved in trying to overthrow our democracy.
redpiano82991,"Sam Alito could get on national television right now and openly brag about leaking the opinion and sleeping with your sister and there wouldn't be one damn consequence. You know why? Because this has never been about anything other than power. Let's stop treating an affidavit like it has some magical power to make liars tell the truth and recognize that it's time that we, the people, abolish the Supreme Court. To the extent that we ought to have such judges they should serve at the pleasure of the people, not at their own and for the duration of their lives."
,[deleted]
Ch_IV_TheGoodYears,Cause Alito and Clarence were the leaders duh
hamsterfolly,"It wasn’t a real investigation, it just pandered to the fake outrage from the rightwingers. 

It was Alito all along."
_Fuck_This_Guy_,I have a suspicion as to why.
cargocult25,Because it was Alito…
nschwalm85,Well.. because it was one of the conservative justices that 'leaked' it
AriBlue626,"The big question is, once we find out it was one of the Justices, what can even be done about it?"
Catspaw129,"Why did the investigators not think to ask George Santos?

ibelieveindogs,It will happen when congress has to abide by the laws they pass for workplaces that they themselves are also somehow exempted from. Lawmakers always pull this shit.

bigsteve9713,"Don't give a fuck who leaked it as they did the right thing but those who revoked Roe V Wade are above the law, just like The Janurary 6th Coup investigation, nothing will change"
Porkchopper913,Logic would dictate because the leak came from one of them.
Incompetent_Sysadmin,"Affidavits? Holy shit, did they go fishing with affidavits to try to manufacture criminal liability for the leaker? (Since leaking that document probably wasn’t illegal, but making false sworn statements sure is)

Telling these affidavits weren’t given to the swine on the bench."
Brilliant-Engineer57,It was Kavanaugh
Radiant-Call6505,It gets increasingly pathetic each day. Too much privilege breeds ethical lapses which is what the decision to undo Roe was in the first place.

Flaky_Seaweed_8979,These fucking pigs
URBeneathMe,"I believe him.  A 4 star general.  This man spent decades studying warfare and a good amount of time studying military history.  And I’m pretty sure he has a good understanding on current global affairs.

I hope he’s wrong too but it’s China.  Can’t be too careful with them.  I’m guessing the battlefield will be around Taiwan."
workingtoward,"Another case that the Republicans are going to have investigate during their investigations of the ‘weaponizing’ of government for political ends. 

They’ve got so many Republican cases with so much evidence, I don’t know how they’ll ever get to the Democratic cases without any evidence."
slickhedstrong,"my theory is it was sotomayor. she's basically and activist judge and see the moral imperative in taking such action and facilitating it.

point blank, though, whoever leaked it and *whoever broke the story* should be tried for treason. 

this wasn't whistleblowing, this was interrupting the judicial process in the highest court in the land to sew discord among the general population on purpose."
Plow_King,"""a group""? wow, that sounds serious. better look out, the Take Back the Court Action Fund is on the USSC's ass!

captaincanada84,No need to investigate... It's because a Supreme Court Justice was the one who leaked the ruling.
