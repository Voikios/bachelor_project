TrollTrolled,When BSG failed him he took matters into his own hands
SuffaYassavi,"EDIT: Mods gave me a week ban for pointing out they are BSG employees. Don't believe me? Try it yourself!


You met BattleEye, this is tarkov anti cheat"
Aceylah,"We used to have this cheater in OCE labs, he would always use a loud m1a. He would shoot it at the start of any raid he was in and you knew if you stayed out of his way for 3 minutes you could play the raid as normal. He would kill all the other cheaters in the raid. Sadly that was peak labs."
zaoki,When the system fails you and you have to become the very thing you swore to destroy.
NvIWraith,"its happened before, there was a dude on youtube streaming himself aimbotting ppl on labs and another cheater started stream sniping him with better cheats that could shoot through the walls and made the streamer rage quit, it was so funny listening to some of the mental gymnastics these guys have.  


I should have recorded it but at the time i wasnt even thinking about it"
DropDeddBlue,The game now features evil flying demons trying to take our loot and now flying angels who battle for our soul. How are cheaters having fun with this for longer than a day or two? Has it really gotten so bad that white knight hackers are stepping up?
paraquartz_32,"Bro, this is reaching OMEGALUL level. Imagine the cheating situation this wipe is so bad that some cheater just boot up the game with cheats just to hunt another cheater. Unreal."
RealSinJax,"I was doing Jaeger's Hermit quest and farming some Rogues earlier while watching some Youtube on a second monitor so sorry if it was hard to hear anything. I tried to add subtitles. This guy was at least honest and let me live, but I'm sure it wouldn't have been the same if I wasn't in just a bank robber+VPO."
Amadeus_Ray,People using hacks to fight hackers... That's like a whole new level of ridiculous.

RJLPDash,"This reminds me of Team Fortress 2, public lobbies absolutely swarming with cheating bots that would just run around and make the server unplayable, someone got bored of it and made his own bots that only target the other cheaters, shit was/is wild"

rodgers12gb,why does it sound like jonah hill?
SyntheticSins,"We have met Counter-Strike 1.6 levels of hacking.  


Back in the early 2000's, hackers were so rampant across Counter-Strike 1.6 that many players  used 'counter-hacks' to fight off hackers when they came into their server."

OGMcgriddles,You know the game is fucked up when good cheaters start existing.  This happened in GTA.
Susman22,This game is dogshit lmao
Wizard_IT,"The hacking in this game, along with the absolute ridiculousness when it comes to bullet and armored penetration has just ruined the experience. I remember a couple years ago playing the alpha of this and it was great in that when you shot somebody they would actually die. Now it's like playing halo, and the person doesn't die after tanking 15 rounds, a hacker will just headshot you from halfway across the map. Or if they want to have a bit more fun they might just fly up to you and just beat you with an ax since they're bullet proof.

BSG really needs to get their shit together on this."
mrpicachu,Thank god someone has done it! Can he stream?

ToiletGrenade,He wouldn't have had to resort to fighting fire with fire if the game had decent server side anticheat. Just boot anyone who makes illegal movements.

EvrythingsCopacetic,i dont know how im supposed to feel about this
Thatoneirish,We need more people like that
TrueZinner,May the strongest hax win
CountBlah_Blah,How can he kill cheaters if they usually have that invincibility cheat I've seen so they dont die?
Mikey3DD,"I feel like this is staged. 

Reason? The test press of his VoIP key before he sees the cheater. He's got discord set up to mute when he presses his VoIP key, which is what the little bloop tones are you hear. The lower one is the mute tone, the higher one is the unmute. 

Why would you press your VoIP key randomly but not speak just before you see a cheater? Just seems a bit Sus to me."

69ing_Giraffes,"This is me if you have any questions.  I really got tired of getting gaslighted by cheaters for 4k hours that I decided to experiment and see how bad it was.  Depending on the map before the ban wave yesterday I was getting approximately 1-2 cheaters in about half of my lobbies with a 20k/d or higher.  Almost all the cheaters are closet cheating and doing tasks to level up.... but if you get in their way or they don't like your username then you better believe they are going to kill you and usually make it seem legit.  Anyone cheating or with a cheater that I can confirm I kill.  God mode does not allow myself to take damage usually but you can do more research on ways to combat that.  I do not kill people that are not cheating but sometimes scare people and spread awareness on the issue.  I have played the game for 5 wipes and am truly disappointed that I am able to find level 50 cheaters with 50+ k/ds.  Their manual ban team is not very good it seems.  The most common cheet people use is one that has been undetected for almost 3 years but does not have God mode so I am able to quickly end their raids so they cannot ruin others experiences.  We play this game to escape reality of life not only tarkov.  There are cheaters consistently killing poor players just trying to enjoy the game only be assholes and it is disgusting.  The more you rat around the less likely you are to run into a cheater, the more you chad the more you will get instant killed by them.  They are betas trying keep everyone else down.  Sorry to ruin some of your emersion flying around though."
PlantBasedBilly,We need more flying cheaters killing other cheaters. This might be the way to combat cheaters to be honest.
69ing_Giraffes,"honestly idk how everyone should feel about this, most of you should hate me and assume i'm just another asshole cheater.  It is not the case, but I would probably assume it was as well.  So I don't blame anyone for hating me for doing this.  I am laughing my ass off at all the comments though."
IcyFrxst,good game
