nubxmonkey,"Amazing work! Thank you for your handwork for the Tarkov community.

You've mentioned in this thread that you used Blender and Photoshop to create these 3D maps. I am very curios how map maker like yourself ensure that map are to scale and accurate in dimensions? Does it involve datamining or do you use some sort of visual measurement?"

trogdor1108,Nice! Now I have a decent map to use for when this map is actually playable on a mid range PC in a wipe or two.
battlestate-what-the,"Hey re3mr, what's your process on these?  They're gorgeous and compete favorably against products by professional cartographers. So I am super curious how you made these!

The one suggestion I would have would be to replace the Letters (C, D, E etc) with symbols from the Noun Project, like crane, helicopter (for evac), the back of a car for taxi etc. To make the associations more intuitive.

I can see that you've tried to do that with how you've lettered them. And so I thought maybe this could help?"
GunswayTV,Thanks!!!! This community owes you a debt of gratitude.
LightTrack,This is insanely professional and easy to read. Pure eye candy! Amazing work. Why did i not see your work before? Learning the maps has always been the main reason why i never got too deep into Tarkov but that might change now thanks to you.
SneedDeez,I pretty much exclusively use your maps. Absolute hyper chad.
straight_lurkin,Thank you!!!
Trepaneringsritualen,Great work!
stook,"You should totally put this up as an interactive 3d model. 

If you're not sure quite how to do that just ask Chat GPT and chances are it will explain how to do it and write the code for you."

joe_dirty365,Impressive work. Not playing this wipe (never really broke out past level 20 on any wipe) but this is pretty incredible. Bravo.
packapunch_koenigseg,"The best map maker. Blessed. 

If only I could actually play streets. Fps isn‚Äôt bad but the latency has me bouncing all over the place for the first 5-10 minutes of the raid. Resulting in half the time with me just dropping dead at the beginning of a raid"
LocalSlob,This would be a great map to use if Streets was playable.
Chinpokkomon,"the map runs with better FPS than the actual map 

&#x200B;

gg"
not_James_C,"You're the man! 

&#x200B;

TY!"
StealthCatUK,"This is really good, but the one thing these maps are missing, is doors for entrances and exits to buildings. The amount of times I've walked up to a building to go inside but couldn't."
strikervulsine,"For all its faults, Tarkov has a great atmospheric map design. The maps feel lived in and like this have happened there.

The map designers knocked it out of the park in this regard."
Bradur-iwnl-,first time in my life i will not use this map. I want to feel the novel feeling of finding out a map (havent played much this wipe lol) but it looks fucking sick with wayyyy too much info. Never thought it would be that quick lol
Thee_Sinner,"I haven‚Äôt played in a while, how many of those big buildings are actually fully accessible?"
PlayerRedacted,"Just wanted to say I've been looking forward to this release from the moment Streets went live. I always use your maps where available, and love how easy to read and clean your style is compared to some of the interactive maps that I used to just turn everything off of anyway. Thank you for the amazing work you do on these."
rambii,the best post on this subreddit
cheadle69,"The 3D map for the Streets of Tarkov map in Escape From Tarkov is indeed impressive and well-designed. The map is highly detailed and accurately depicts the layout and features of the in-game location, making it a valuable tool for players to use during gameplay. The level of detail in the map, along with its intuitive interface, make it easy for players to navigate and plan their movements in the game. Overall, the 3D map is a valuable asset for players of Escape From Tarkov and helps enhance the realism and immersion of the game."
A_Tipsy_Rag,@re3mr what does the number in the top right corner of the buildings mean?
Yung_Branch,What program/site are you using for this? I'd love to use it to make some maps for other games
TRG_SKStudios,"What an amazing-looking map! I have just added to the list of Streets maps available on the Play Store app ""TRG: Tarkov Raid Guide"". Cheers 10/10"
LiterallyABlackBear,You managed to capture my framerate on streets perfectly.
getgroovyloony,"To bad 80% of the player base cant use the map becuase they can't load in for 20 minutes at a time, and whrn they do they average 10 frames or rubber band to hell and back."
kentrak,"Sewer might deserve some small text, like some of the caches have, explaining that it's outside on the grass next to the building.  As it is now, it looks like it's pointing into that building.

Catacombs has the same issue, sort of, but to a much lesser degree.

Overall very nice, thank you!"
DabScience,Now we just have to wait until we can run Streets without rubber banding everywhere.
Vladliash,"Not being obnoxious, but you have some mistakes in Russian texts, I can pinpoint them for you DM me, if you're interested.
Great work."
PongoFAL,level 16 not been on this map yet lol
Leytarkhan,"Really cool work

but 3d maps are not for me they just confuse the fuck out of me."
masterscout9,Damn I will never use this map
ilight8,ngl 3d maps are awful for ingame.
Sneaky_Rhin0,its missing few caches
