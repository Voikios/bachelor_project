ks99,"Pelosi is pictured but she isn’t a boomer, she is Silent Generation."
SuperGenius98K,Now reduce the MAGAs.
faiIing,"Funny how the Democratic house leadership mentioned in this artcle basically went straight from Silent Generation to Gen X, skipping the boomers. Although Clark is technically a boomer by the most common definiton (born in mid-1963)."
LordSiravant,Good. It's a start.
luneunion,"I contend that I'd rather have the Bernies and Warrens there than the Gaetzs and Boeberts, regardless of what generation they're from. It's about a person's ideas, not their age or gender or race or any other uncontrollable characteristic.   


The fact that this happened in a year with Republican gains implies to me that we're just replacing old bad guys with young bad guys, so yay?"
,"Pelosi is pictured, but she isn’t a Baby Boomer."
Kyonikos,"As a Boomer, I would like to point out that there have always been left of center and radically left of center Boomers. Publications like the Nation and radio stations like WBAI and radio shows like Democracy Now all had Boomer audiences.
 
A lot of us Boomers felt nearly suicidal with the ascendancy of Reagan and looked aghast at Clintonism as a Democratic Party that also betrayed us.

A lot of us Boomers always had a checklist that read like Bernie Sanders platform: universal healthcare, free state education up to the college level, affordable housing and a robust safety net. 

The problem was that we were outnumbered by the Boomers who didn't share those values."
LizinVA0223,"As a Boomer I am trying to help your generation. My kids are your generation.  I have 8 Grandkids, I want their lives to be better. What happens in Congress is not imperative ti what I want for my family. I want people like you to care for future generations."
BarbFinch,"Doesn't seem like it matters. This younger crop of extremist republicans seem worse. I'm not a fan of George Bush, but at least he put up the facade of being a caring decent human being. Sometimes even just acting like you care about people is better than outright unapologetic hatred, and willful ignorance. The way people have latched onto this behavior and way of thinking is startling and absolutely disgusting. I wouldn't want to be my daughters age (20). At least I can pretty much guarantee that my life is at least half over and maybe I will pass away before the worst of the worst happens."
BelAirGhetto,The nastiest right wingers are not boomers anyway.
Ellecram,"I am 65. I have always been a liberal and I have become more liberal as the years went on.
In fact I would call myself a progressive."
MicheleKO,With a picture of Nancy who is not a boomer.
Lofteed,"why not go all the way with the title:

Millenials are responsible for the decline of Boomers in Congress"
Equivalent_Energy_87,I didnt know they were a party in congress
zeezero,"And congress is currently by the worst group in history. 
Maybe age isn't as defining as the ok boomer crowd thinks. You can be a piece of shit at any age."
Joe_Metaphor,Who cares? We still have Gen X and millenial nutcases like Boebert and MTG and the rest. I couldn't care less about your age as long as you're not a right-wing extremist.
kauaidog, I’m a boomer and that’s good by me!  Let’s see what you young whipper-snappers can do...
V0lleyd0g,About damn time!
R3miel7,Idiots will think this is a good thing. Spoilers: young fascists are just as bad as old fascists. Age means nothing compared to the actual values the electeds hold.
Bkwordguy,Time to start the switch to the metric system?
Melodic-Chemist-381,Because they were replaced by traitors. Thanks Republicans for being douche bags.
hmm-boy,"As a Boomer, I say Huzzah!"
BirdLawyer50,It’s a shame a lot of the young people are profit driven puppet sociopaths
jazzismusic,"The idea that boomers were the problem will soon be proven false. There are still a ton of young Republicans. Some of the worst Republicans in congress are gen x or younger. Age is not the issue, and this whole generation war is so dumb."
Imacatdoincatstuff,"Everything will be fine now, just fine. /s"
,[deleted]
rosencrantz2014,"Are the ""new"" replacements sons or realtives of the old ones? Because that never works."
tyleritis,Yeah. That’s how linear time works
DrydenTech,It's almost like time is linear.
officegeek,This isn't an age problem as much as it is a wealth problem.
AllTheyEatIsLettuce,"I don't need a Boomer majority in Congress. Or a Gen A-Z majority. I need a majority of the elected in both Houses to be Progressive Caucus members.

-- me, a Boomer"
Mystiic_Madness,I hope people realise that Boomers used to be the 'young generation' and todays Millennial/Gen-Z politicans will be the 'Boomer' generation of tommorow
SnapesGrayUnderpants,"The problem isn't the age of the politicians, it's the money. As long as politicians take money from the wealthy, the wealthy will be their constituents. Also, members of Conress are paid far too much. Too much makes them out of touch. There isn't anyone in Congress anywhere my income level."
FineRevolution9264,Then why is this Congress the most far-right I've ever seen?
EnderCN,Good news. Simply actually looking at the data shows that every generation is a little less conservative than the one before it right now so the younger congress gets and the more people age out of it the better.
TopNFalvors,Yeah but the younger ones are MAGA nuts…
SockFullOfNickles,"The age average dropped, but the Corporate Servitude remains the same across the board. 🤨"
biggreencat,"the face of millenial GOPs in congress: Boebert, Gaetz, Santos....."
chapeksucks,"GOOD.  Boomer here. I want millennials and Gen Z in office. My generation should offer support and advice based on years of experience. But they should get the heck out of office. Please let the people who grew up with tech, who see the working world differently (no, we don't all need to be in offices and yes that meeting could have been an email) take over."
IndecisionRobot,"As it's been said before, given my understanding of linear time, I'm fascinated to hear what the alternative is"
NBCspec,"Hurray!! Now we can add more ""alt reality leadership"".."
IsAliveSomehow,Out with the old in with the slightly less old.
calcteacher,who has the majority now?  who can we start blaming after they have been majority for a while?
Historical_Big_7404,"Fantastic. Semi-retired 66 year old liberal here from deep south red -state, Louisiana.  
Cannot believe my ""cool"" friends from high school in the '70's have sold out, or sold their souls to anti-science ,bigoted, far-right  republican propaganda.
Friends whose parents fought WWII to prevent fascism now embrace it.
But I attribute these attitudes to their having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.
Also their employment in the oilfield has tainted their world view. 
Totally disappointed in my generation which started out to change the world and left such a mess for the following generations"
Mildf0g,"Little does the population know….politicians won’t change, even if their age does"
desertgal2002,"Finally.  And this coming from a boomer herself.  

It is time to let go of the reigns and let the next generation try their hand at this mess that we call the United States government.  However, I have little faith that it will change much…maybe aesthetically, but the core will always remain the same unfortunately…corrupt and greedy."
HyenaFan,Can’t get past the paywall :( Anyone got a quick summary?
jorel43,"Lol it's humorous that everyone that they listed in the article is actually from the silent generation rather than the Boomer generation.  This year Boomer generational range is from 77 years to 59 years. So those 59-year-olds are still boomers.. lol, I think someone in the article should show their work."
ReichRecon,This is literally not news. It's nonsense. The politics are still controlled by individuals with their own agenda. Not one of these people right or left give a shit about the avg person.
colbyjackrat222,"Also Boomers are not the problem (well, kinda, the whole being brain-poisoned by lead when they were children certainly didn't help things), far right conservative ideology is the problem.  We have plenty of younger far right extremists in the government, freshly elected too.

Do you think Gen X celebrated when the previous generation was replaced by Boomers and they said ""Well, problem solved!""?"
Significant_Egg_Y,"Unfortunately it's still infested with cynical, greedy Republicans from Generation X."
Singer_221,Boomer here to say good.
platinum_toilet,Having good policies is more important than what generation someone was born in.
lew_rong,"Please, George Santos was born in whatever year he needs to have been born to be cool."
YourphobiaMyfetish,"There is no generation war, there is only class war. There is no proper feeling here other than mild interest or neutrality."
ProdigiousPlays,That's nice but what about corporate puppets are they still the majority?
-flame-retardant-,Now we can look forward to hearing from the millennial right wing nut jobs.
Lopsided_Panic_1148,"Pelosi, Clyburn, and Hoyer are Silent Generation, not Boomers."
UnhappyStop8010,"So many should step aside. In my state of Oregon, I love Ron Wyden and Earl Blumeauer but fuck we need fresh voices. So tired of lifelong politicians."
Windflower1956,"I’m an old white woman, on the younger end of the boomer generation. And god I’m so tired of all the geriatric white politicians. I’m so ready for younger, sharper, more diverse people to be in office."
silasbrock,Meet the new boss...
frank_mania,"As a boomer who spent his youth thinking things would be much better once my parents' generation died and/or aged out of politics, I am now quite certain that age has very little bearing on the matter. 

Older voters are a danger to progress, though. Except when they fight to preserve the Medicare.  Then they are vital."
hjablowme919,Pretty sure it’s safe to say that “asshole” is a good word to describe the current majority in the House of Representatives.
_ara,"And everything sucks! Who we going to blame next? Surely, not ourselves"
Yorgonemarsonb,"Suspected this is why republicans are going so hard after what they consider “entitlements”.  

Boomers just aren’t a big enough voting block for them to care anymore."
BrizzelBass,"As a Xoomer, it’s time to let the millennials sort this chaos out the best they can.  Start with term limits for all— including judges!"
Charming-Complaint29,"The division lines between generations have never made any sense to me.  Nancy Pelosi was born in 1940 and to me she is clearly a baby boomer.   Andy Warhol was born in 1928.  Martin Luther King was 1929.  Are these people really part of the ""Silent Generation?""  These are the people that defined the 1960's cultural shift.

I'm a clear Baby Boomer-- 1957.  I remember (vaguely) the big political assassinations (JFK,RFK, MLK).   Viet Nam war was very much a part of my childhood with friends' older siblings getting killed on the battlefield or dodging the draft, the cold war, the Beatles, hippie communes, etc..

There's a huge generational separation between people who clearly remember life before the internet and those who don't.  To me the internet seems as historically and culturally significant as the invention of the printing press."
Dont_U_Fukn_Leave_Me,The loons in congress are younger now. Great.
was_and_wasnt,Just as well.  Let others have a shot at mucking it up.
r-mancuso83,Okay. It’s still the same shit.
sg1rob,I'm a boomer and I think this is a good thing. Now if we could only do the same with the theists..
milktanksadmirer,"I’d rather have Bernie in there rather than new age, unapologetic, apathetic and corrupt politicians"
GalacticShoestring,"The young republicans are way, way worse and extreme. 

The only way to appease them is to stop existing. Fuck them."
wwaxwork,"As a Gen X, about bloody time."
PhysicalPolicy6227,"So who are you going to blame now for your problems, kids,"
survivor2bmaybe,And nonboomer rethugs control the House and are more crazy conservative than ever. Kinda explodes the whole everything is the fault of the boomers thing.
BlueBloodLive,"America, full of diversity, different ethnicity, religions or lack thereof, and people who range from one day old to people over 100.

American politicians, however, are for the most part white, Christian and old, or to put it better, wildly out of sync with the average American.

At least Democrats are openly trying to get more diversity and equality into their party, meanwhile Republicans are like ""eh, we have like, 3 women and 1 black guy, that's plenty diverse for us!"
WarmanHopple,60% of Americans vs The rich and their useful idiots
cervidaetech,They don't need one.   Conservatives have a ruling minority
So_spoke_the_wizard,Now everyone can STFU and start fixing the problems.
mandy009,What about Silent Gen?
Pale-Bandicoot7652,"I’m a boomer and I say, “About damn time!”"
calcteacher,good  now maybe others will step up and make a difference
ZY_Qing,Replaced by more right wing younger generations…
hoods_breath,"They are still the biggest age group, but they no longer out number everyone else."
Altruistic-Deal-4257,"Remember, Nick Fuentes is in his early 20s."
Muvseevum,"Was going to happen sooner or later. All yours now, younguns. Let’s see what you got."
daxxarg,"It’s a start, To bad half of the people that aren’t boomers are still bat shit crazy republicans"
GoDM1N,"I know there are going to be a lot of ""good"" comments but, honestly, I'm not expecting much of a change"
trippler720,"Sounds great but the up and coming are going to be just the same. The problem is the system. Our government has been bought over multiple times. Until taking a government position becomes more of a public service and less of a get rich quick scheme, nothing will change."
Loreki,That's just how time works guys. Why are we reporting this as news?
