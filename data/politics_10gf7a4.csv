InternetPeon,Well it cuts to the heart of the matter.  We’re not going to get sane governance unless we put a stop to unlimited anonymous donations.
AtuinTurtle,"“Schiff has introduced an amendment to overturn the Citizens United ruling every year since 2013, according to the release.”

I wouldn’t get your hopes up."
PRPLpenumbra,"Good, it was one of the biggest attacks on democracy in recent memory"
BlotchComics,"""Schiff has introduced an amendment to overturn the Citizens United ruling every year since 2013, according to the release.""

.

It has just as much chance of being passed this time as it has for the past 10 years."
notcaffeinefree,"Technically the amendment would give Congress the power to regulate and limit campaign financing.

Which means that not only would this amendment have to be passed and then ratified, but then Congress would still have to pass another law that sets rules."
00000000000004000000,"Schiff's been doing this every ~~year~~ congress for 9 years, trying to introduce an amendment since 2013.  The fact that this has mostly been met with silence by other members of congress and the media is deafening.

EDIT: From what I can tell, the article incorrectly states:
> Schiff has introduced an amendment to overturn the Citizens United ruling every year since 2013, according to the release.

He hasn't introduced it every year, but [every elected congress](https://www.congress.gov/member/adam-schiff/S001150?q=%7B%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22joint-resolutions%22%7D), so every 2 years.  It first started with the 112th congress (2011-2012) to today's 118th congress (2023-2024).  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong."
cheap90scigar,"Some think tanks are of the mind that a simple overturn of Citizens wouldn't work anyway, as political finance is completely off the rails at this point. But here are some smaller pieces of legislation that could minimize the influence of the small group of rich donors that currently dominate political finance:

1. Boost Citizen funding of elections by providing tax rebates for small contributions
2. More transparency on political spending by strengthening donor disclosure requirements
3. Require transparency for online Ad buys
4. Close loopholes that allow super PACs to coordinate with candidates
5. Stop the flow of dark money to nonprofits by increasing disclosures requirements past a certain dollar amount
6. Re-fund the FEC to monitor, audit, and enforce campaign finance

I think exactly zero of these will happen because many people in DC would have to answer a lot of tough questions about what they've been up to over the last decade. I think they'll get away with this con until something catastrophic happens (like a scandal) that gets the people's attention. Otherwise, ""campaign finance reform"" is not a topic that seems to hold the general public's attention for very long.

Sensitive_File6582,"Repealing Citizens united has an 80% approval rate across all parties in the USA.
Republicans hate it too. Corporate power should be separated from the govt. the founders didn’t perceive the influence of corperations would begin to wield."
Siege138," Schiff has introduced this same legislation every year since 13. Citizens United ruling has hurt this country beyond belief. It’s repeal is needed badly. Unfortunately, it will never get voted on in this Congress. Yay!"
HelpfulSeaMammal,"IIRC, Schiff has brought this up every year since the ruling occurred. I love his persistence. Hoping we can see something come from this, but I'm not going to hold my breath with the current GQP majority in the House."
cosaboladh,How quaint. A constitutional amendment that needs to be ratified by the craziest GOP run state governments in history.
paraz5,A day late and several hundred billion dollars short
JohnnieFedora,"Win majorities in congress, keep hold of the presidency,  nix the filibuster and re-balance/expand the court and set a 15 year appointment for the justices."
libra00,">Schiff has introduced an amendment to overturn the Citizens United ruling every year since 2013

This really tells you all you need to know.  I'm 100% with them that the Citizens United decision is bad for the country and should absolutely be overturned and I applaud the effort, but this is going to go the same place the last 9 did."
Shaunair,He’s introduced this proposal every year since 2013. That’s both awesome and super depressing.
BoomTownRat71,Good.  Because that Court decision turned our democracy into a plutocracy.
2OneZebra,And tax the church
Fun_Client_6232,If you ask the average republican voter if getting rid of corporate and/or dark money out of campaigns is a good idea they’ll probably say yes. But once fox & other right wing media gets ahold of the issue then the average republican voter will be against it.
taztokyo-of-abq,couldn’t they have done that when they were in the majority?
taway66066,Every legislator that will vote against this should be considered corrupt
GogetaSama420,"This is one of the biggest issues both Democrats and Republicans alike [seem to agree on for the most part.](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/study-most-americans-want-to-kill-citizens-united-with-constitutional-amendment/) If this doesn’t work, I don’t know what else will wake up people to the fact that republicans are against the people and for the billionaires"
razor382,It’s about time. One of the worst Supreme Court decisions ever made and true slap in the face to the American people and democracy. Big business and special interests run our elections and government
PicassosGhost,The amount of people commenting COuldN'T HaVe dOne ThAT whiLE tHEy hAd conTRoL clearly didn’t bother reading.
TheYokedYeti,Run this in ADs. Say republicans are accepting bribes.
CarlMarcks,"Holy shit. Bravo. 

Even if it’s just an attempt the fact this is even a thing. Fuck ya."
Ozymandias12,"Hate to be a Debbie downer but this gets introduced every Congress. It won’t go anywhere. Even if it passed Congress, it would need to get adopted by 2/3 of states. No red state would do that."
IbanezGuitars4me,Legalized bribery. That's what it is. It's simply legalized bribery of our government officials. We are a banana Republic.
Utterlybored,"This a very heavy lift, but we need to start this process."
srodden1,Fucking FINALLY! Most shady political shit stems from this piece of shit ruling.
simmons777,"This will never pass, don't get me wrong, I'm rooting for it but I doubt it happens."
ispeakdatruf,"Of course they'll do it now, when they don't have a majority in the House. WTF were they doing for the past 2 years?

Edit: I stand corrected. Looks like he's been introducing it for the past decade."
almighty28,Don't amendments need 2/3rds to pass anyway?
McDeviance,Yes.
yeswecann,"More of this, please"
YesSkyDaddy,Yes please
DannysFavorite945,This case really is the source of a shot ton of problems in this country today. Most people haven’t even heard of it.
Brasilionaire,"Democrats are proposing this while republicans want to revamp the tax code to be regressive. 

Both parties are not the same and fuck whoever spreads that lie."
TrainsDontHunt,"DO IT! 

If a corporation can't be locked in prison for crimes, then it is not a People."
InternationalTea4104,Which will accomplish exactly nothing.
PhilosophicalBrewer,Cool. Introduce the single most important piece of legislation you possible can **after** you lose half of congress.
hfmyo1,The amount of people who don't read the article are ridiculous.   Schiff has done this every year since 2013.
rconrad2k,"My version would be simple. If you can’t actually vote for the candidate you can’t donate. $2,000 per cycle limit. Eliminate PACs."
ahintoflimon,"Won’t pass, but even if the legislation is mostly symbolic, it points to a major flaw in the system and a need for real change. Nothing will ever be done if it’s never even discussed, so at least it’s being proposed and there’s some sort of a conversation there."
Rare-Assumption8417,I'd love to see the GOP call their bluff and pass it.
idletooth,Dark money and its absolute rape of government is the fight and the root of all the other bullshit. Nothing else comes close.
NickPickle05,"Unless democrats somehow sweep the board in both the senate and the house, it'll never happen. The best we can hope for is a future supreme court finding it unconstitutional. It would be a huge game changer if that got removed. I often wonder what it would be like if there were were two US'. One completely ruled by Democrats and one ruled by Republicans. Now fast forward 100 years into the future and see what each nation looks like. I imagine the difference would be astounding. One would probably be poverty stricken with a flat tax bracket. Everyone pay x%. No go to the other one and taxes would be high. However, healthcare is free. Education is a priority, and people work less hours and make more money. The overall quality of life is better. Guns are banned, crime is down, and there are significantly less people in prisons. Green energy technology has advanced significantly and everything is run on it. It has its problems but people seem happier and healthier."
YakOrnery,This is what I love to see! Put forth meaningful legislation and get the real conversation started!
Peppered63,"Just sent an email to my new congressman. I expect it won't do much good, but I'm gonna keep emailing him about EVERYTHING!"
buffcrowd,This would be so great for our country.
Puidwen,"I actually don't have a proplem with this.  As far as i can tell it mainly just targets campaign financing. (Trying to find the wording for this one, i saw one from 2013 that could do far more than that.)  I do wonder why he threw in the part at the end about public funding."
J3D1,Im so proud to be a Democrat
WuTangClams,now we're fukin talking
aspertame_blood,Holy shit!! 👍🏻
Speedwithcaution,I want Republicans and independents signing on to this. Make it happen!! Write your representatives!
100farts,This shows the difference between Dems and repunicants
StandStillLaddie,"Yeah, both parties are the same. Fuck the GQP."
Scooterforsale,People worship Republicans but they keep denying this. Can't get anymore corrupt. Why are we letting this happen? I'm so down to protest this
LudovicoSpecs,"This is huge if doable. If this is doable, I'll donate to help it happen."
Economy_Fee_1790,This is the most important legislation of our lifetime.
Pillsburydinosaur,"Wow. Another one that has no chance of passing. 

Where is our D.C. and Puerto Rico statehood? Where is our minimum wage increase. 

You could have passed them when you had power or during the lame duck session. You could have also raised the debt ceiling. But instead you guys are playing politics. 

This crap needs to stop. If I  could all of them would have a 15 to 20 year term limits. Maybe we would get people who actually care about us."
CptWholesome,This is only happening because it has no chance of passing. Both sides are about to engage in 2 years of posturing and virtue signaling and nothing is going to get done. What a waste of breath.
ragnarokfps,Great. About fucking time. Get that shit the fuck outta here.
DontHateDefenestrate,They waited til the GOP controlled the House so that they could get credit for it without any risk of it actually passing.
MorganWick,This shouldn't be necessary. The First Amendment should not mean that some people get more free speech than others. If we're going to amend the Constitution let's amend it to change the way Supreme Court justices are appointed and/or provide a realistic recourse if a decision is clearly contrary to the Constitution.
nonlinear_nyc,Good. This is the Pandora's box. All rest is reaction to it.
AccurateStromtrooper,"Right on cue, they waited until there was no chance of it going anywhere"
Earth_Friendly-5892,"I bet that most Americans support this. It is obvious that the competition to raise the most amounts of money for a political campaign in this country, is one of the variables that is undermining our democracy."
OkCalendar7770,Thank god. Get rid of it
kudatimberline,This makes me so happy!!! Now codify Roe
ausofbounds,Yes Please let this pass. Corporations aren't people. We know this because the Trump org being guilty of close to $250 million in tax fraud and no one was even threatened with jail time.
Former-Equipment-791,Chance of this passing: stone cold 0 and that is proveable mathematically
vn7320,Why didn't they do that when they were in control of Congress?
Illuminated12,Republicans should support this correct?  Since all they have been doing for the last 6 years is complaining about it??? Right?? Right??
TonyDungyHatesOP,I will help campaign vigorously for any candidate working to reverse Citizens United.
Zargoza1,"That’s where we are, it requires a constitutional amendment to make bribery illegal"
TI_Pirate,"Interesting but, with regard to Section 4:

>Nothing in this Article shall be construed to grant Congress or the States the power to abridge freedom of the press. 

That appears to say that anything I, or anyone else,  can legally publish today durring an election,  we could continue to publish after the amendment.  Which doesn't really do anything about CU at all."
thebardbecoming,"Zero media coverage. No one is going to bat for this. Shame, it could have the biggest real world positive change in politics in a long time."
frenchyp,How can normal citizens support this concretely?
JohnnyGFX,"Hey Republicans... This is what we want. This is the kind of 'small government' shit you all seem to crave so much. This is how you start to dig the tick known as 'dark money' out of American politics and begin to 'drain the swamp'. Get on board... help us get this done. This isn't for party, it's for country. Get behind this.

I'm an independent and I approve this message."
jayfeather31,This isn't going to go anywhere with the Congressional makeup like it is.
nudgeya,Citizens United is one of the worst long-term things to happen to American Politics recently.
Interesting_Park4945,He does the every year and it just silently dies.  They need to actually make noise about who is blocking it.
lilwayneusherliljon,This subreddit is so mired in delusion it’s honestly frightening.

B1GFanOSU,Why?  It’s going straight into the trash bin.
UbiquitouSparky,Why didn't they do this a year ago when they had the house?
serbeardless,And they didn't want to do this when they controlled both chambers of Congress?
3dnewguy,Why didn't they do this a year ago?
Jaceking11,"When fixing a house plagued with corruption, you should always start with the foundation. If passed this would have an enormous impact on every issue we face as a nation."

,Why wait to try this when in the minority of the house? I hope they can somehow pick off a handful of r’s to get it passed but I doubt it.
tennisfanatic1,Now we’re talking.  Make the peoples vote count.  Get rid of so much money influencing elections.  It’s not democracy anymore.
Seraphynas,And you couldn’t do this while you still had control of Congress?
DDS-PBS,Yawn.  Wake me up when something real happens.
echo6golf,Give ‘‘em hell.
wulfgang14,Why didn’t they introduce this when they had the majority?
smartyr228,No fuckin way this passes and the masses won't even care
itsnotthenetwork,They really should have done this last year.  Its pointless with the GQP in control of the house.
Qdog1929,It's about fucking time!!!
fvtown714x,Anonymous political contributions and lack of transparency into our political process is a huge problem in the medium and long term of our imperfect democracy. This needs to be at the top of the legislative agenda and people need to push their representatives to back such an effort.
Theseus2022,"How does this happen practically?  This, to me, is the single most important thing we can do as a country."
Tr4kt_,God Speed.
Democrateas,Yes please!!!! Finally this gets some attention!
Thadd305,This is so important
Impossible-Throat-59,Yes. Please let politicians expose themselves for being special interest shills.
Coffee_andBullwinkle,Fuck yes. Some much needed sanity
homelaberator,The whole thing needs a rewrite from the ground up.
wewontbudge,Please. This is where everything started going horribly wrong
makeitdooz,This is the kind of shit that will save a democracy.
Dorrbrook,Perfectly timed introduction when all the Dems can vote on it knowing it will fail
califournya,"This will never be repealed. It cannot, mathematically. We've ruined our democracy"
ProDiesel,Why would any American not support this?
SweetieZee,I'm for it.  And any measure that makes political funding more transparent.
VralGrymfang,They waited until they lost power in the house before doing this to make sure it was DOA so they can blame the republicans
Blarghnog,Why didn’t this happen when they had control of the house? I must be missing something.
kingtucker10,Please whatever God that exists in this world let this pass and be.
Existential_Jay,Please God this is the reason we're in this mess

wrath162,Anyone find it odd they waited to do this until republicans have a majority in the house?
essaitchthrowaway,"That's great and all, but why not 4 months ago when they still had a damn majority in both chambers?"
Memory_Less,This is exceptional and hopeful news!
bambino2021,Why did they wait until they lost the majority in the House to do this?
MonkeyCorpz,I can’t imagine how anyone could delude themselves into thinking someone opposing this amendment isn’t corrupt evil.
real_cool_moose,"What annoys me is that this is dead on arrival. No chance in hell something like this has a shot at getting passed. As much as I agree with the goal of this bill, it is just the Dems pandering to their base. If they really wanted to pass this shit they would have at least tried when they had the senate and the house."
matticans7pointO,Guessing this won't get passed by the house? Seems odd to introduce it now when they don't have the votes. Unless they didn't have enough in the Senate before the recent midterm?
S0_Crates,Another example of why both parties are not the same. One side tries to govern in good faith. The other just wants to point fingers and tear down democracy.
Badm,"Sup. Court got this so wrong.  Corporations are NOT people. If they were people, then the government couldn’t force them to have annual meetings or corporate governance rules. If they were people, they couldn’t be used as legal liability shields. They are a made up entity who’s rules can be established by the Congress who gave them existence.  One of those rules was limits on campaign finance. There is also a legitimate fiscal reason for this rule since it is the shareholders’ money and shouldn’t be given away by employees.  Finally, money isn’t speech.  It is related to speech so limits should be scrutinized closely, but money is also inherently corrupting so the government has a legitimate interest to pass laws to keep corruption at bay."
sleepytimejon,"Let me guess. This will be another bill that gets bipartisan public support, but in congress it will only get Democrat support.  Then conservative voters will scratch their heads and spin their hamster wheels trying to figure out why Republicans won’t support such an obvious move to stop corruption.

HMMM GEE I WONDER WHY"
THIS_IS_NOT_SHITTY,"Real nice timing. After dems lose the house. This has no chance of passing.

Edit: apparent Schiff introduces this amendment every year! Even worse that it *still* hasn’t passed. Kinda pissed me off even more. I hate it here

Mari-Lwyd,this obviously has a zero chance of passing. They are introducing this now after they had control for 2 year of both the house and senate. Almost like this was never a real priority for them.
1jobonthislousyship,"Resubmitted because I referenced another user I thought had a good point.

OP:

Regardless of what this thing looks like on its face, has everyone forgotten how difficult it is to get a Constitutional Amendment passed? For reference, the most recent (27th) Amendment was first proposed in September of 1789, and only passed in May of 1992. (For those of us who can't do math in our heads, that's a 203 year time lag.)

This is a loud effort for the sole purpose going nowhere except to point fingers at the folks (again in House majority) who passed this $#!+ legislation to begin with.

Or, if you prefer, another one of those ""I watched the Ghandi documentary"" weak position gambits the kind-hearted, lovely, flailing-armed left is famous for.

<rant> I love you useless f*ckers, but grow some guts, would ya? Our head honcho is a guy who can't stay upright on a bicycle. We seriously voted for this jackass ONLY because he was the one person up for grabs who wasn't naturally bent toward starting a war for the sake of economics.

Maybe one day, this Republic will honor the individual citizen's voice rather than their wallet. Maybe we'll approach democracy some day. </rant>"
dangshnizzle,Wow. How many years late? Damage very much already done
JackStephanovich,If they are pushing an amendment then just go all the way and push for publicly funded elections.  We need to get money out of politics for good.
LakewoodHayandGrain,"The Democrats can add this to their arsenal of sane and popular projects and have all of 2023 and most of 2024 to hammer the message home to voters while the GQP does nothing but obstruct, obfuscate, and obstreperate."

This is the key to saving our country. Doesn’t matter what your politics are. Nothing else matters more than this."
Ok_Effective_2536,We need this more than anything.
