i_am_bromega,Haha a few days ago I was at resort and saw a pistol runner and nearly popped him but he voiped “chilllll bro I’m just doing signal”. I laughed and let him run along.
poopchute53,"My first attempt at signal pt.1, I went by myself at night with a night vision scope SKS and a flashlight pistol. I managed to rat my way through the resort and radio station where the dishes are when I started dying of hunger. At this point im panic running to tunnel, I come to gas station and for whatever reason, these two player scavs let me live, they must have thought I was a scav as well and we both sounded scared over voip lol. I manage to kill a scav at the gas station, and as im running away I get shot at. I figure fuck this is where I die so I dropped my pistol hoping it would come back in insurance, they dont kill me and I make it all the way to the concrete bunker by tunnel where an AI scav with a saiga-12 just mercilessly rocks my shit and kills me. 

I almost spiked my monitor across the room. Fuck signal pt.1, all my homies hate signal pt.1"
nivr0c,"TBH shoreline is what ruins the game for me wipe after wipe. It is a horrible map with a massive amount of literally suicidal quests in the same points over and over. I usually end up doing them and quitting the game shortly after. Shoreline just leaves that ""why bother"" aftertaste I cannot wash off.

Only way I have any luck there is literally sitting in one spot for the first 20 mins of the raid. If the spawn/spot is good that yields large amount of kills(but few of them can be actually looted).

Signal/colleagues without waiting it out should be literally considered the ""harder"" quests in the game. They are MUCH harder than any of the resort quests.

I won't even touch the cheater subject.  
I feel you, man, I feel you so much."
Kujobamjabi,Just go to shoreline at night.
Runb4its2late,I killed someone doing Fishing Gear quest... which was bad karma and then it took me 5 trys to do it myself. Don't think ive repeated a quest so many times
MooreRedditPlease,I have still only found one flash drive. I feel this pain.
Tango6US," Shoreline quests make me forget why I play this game. It is such a trash map. You have to be a sociopath to enjoy that map. The fights outside the resort are incredibly unfun. I can tell no one on that map wants to be there. Everyone just goes for quests. Like 90% of players outside resort are using shotguns, akms, or svds for their quests. The best thing to be said for it is that it runs better then lighthouse or streets."
BoundlessMean,"On an unrelated note does anyone else not shoot people straight away when you see them in a quest area where you have to place an item, like I know I could get an easy kill when they are standing still but it just feels wrong to me."
Ther91,"If you were the one who shot at me as I ran to resort, whiffed most shots and just stood there looking for me.... you brought it on your self sir

Someone else got me by the helicopter tho"
FlatAd768,"I’m trying signal on shoreline right now too. Me and my mosin only. 1st attempt at 17:00

I expect to die"
Cptbetty,"Attempting shooter born in heaven from the roof of westwing, had a hatchling run up the metal stairs going for signal. i let him plant and then told him to jump off the roof. he did, mad respect. Got a funny clip out of it"
Supercalifragicahfuq,"We saw a whole 4 man run up to signal wearing nothing but mosins, we were gonna let ‘em pass until they decided they wanted to camp the roof as well. It didn’t end great for them."
tre_wimmer,Were you running a mosin and a glock
monkeee44,I’ve tried signal so many times bro dude man
LTBiNG,Yeah fuck shoreline
SyntheticSins,Lol just the third?
radelrym,Ummmm were you part of a duo? By swamp?
One-Preference-6630,Jokes on you I like my pillow warm
Anxious-Contract5969,"You are thinking on it too much my friend. 

Just heal and get back out there 💪"
PeaceSellsAndImbuyin,had this shit happen to me doing fishing gear for peacekeeper. On a fucking night raid. I’m running out of funny green sniper rifles for this quest please spare me if you see me at the boat
Impossible_Cat_6450,What was the name of the guy?
illini_2017,"Pro shoreline tip, when you have something else to do like work, a laundry, etc, hide in a bush for the first 25-30 mins of the raid. Then do all ur tasks"
Zero_Strength,I have resorted to running nighttime shoreline raids for tasks like signal. Especially since you can buy NVGs from skier so early on
jacobdajedi,Where did you die? Might have been me 😂
xMrSpazx,Who killed you? Mightve been me 😬
Zombeef252,When the PvP game has PvP.
WhichSeaworthiness49,"Oh good, I enjoy a warm pillow"
StormFallMN,"If it was at night yesterday it was me, with a thermal"
darkwatersinking,.....great shot bro!
thatcooldude23,"Lol nice, r/rareinsults
Good luck man!"
watchfulpickle,so worth posting bro
EJKLINGER,Were you lv30 And wearing no helmet? I head tapped a dude earlier today but not just now
Thesaladman98,It was me. Thanks for the loot.
MilkshakeG,If you want help DM me. I’m on US EAST and will be on in the AM
RicoSour,3rd? That's it? Those are rookie numbers we got pump those up
AmicusBestia,I'm on try 11
TP_Gillz,Should have wished a WET pillow on them. Now that would teach um.
BedFordEgremont,"yeah bro I feel your pain I managed to do it on my second attempt, my first I spawned by resort got that one ran to the second, ratted about and looted up till about 5 mins left in the raid, went to tunnel and boom. killed by an extract camper (dude didn't even loot my body I got everything back on insurance)   


second attempt I went in basically naked at like 8PM spawned right nest to the satellite not at resort and parked my ass in. bush for half hour then sprant to both of them and left via path to lighthouse"
mynameajeff69,idk why but this wipe it took me like 7 tries to get signal 1. some i died and some i didn't but it just never lined up lmao.
VioletteWynnter,I hope his pillow can never be fluffed. Forever doomed to be flat in the middle
throwaway312092138,i am sick of these fucking quests
retronax,My n°1 rule with shoreline is to ALWAYS go at night.
BlackWalmort,"Tried it twice, said nope I’ll wait till I gather a 5man lol"
UneSoggyCroissant,Some dude let me live while I was doing cargo x pt2 on night shoreline.  I owe him my life
Jirelandxc,Try 8 times it was rough
JimmyNuggets,And here's me still struggling to get Prapor's bloody pocket watch!
Sad_Panda_is_Sad,"Whoever just shot me in the head, your moms a hoe."
SilentReavus,Hah imagine only being on your third try
sircontagious,"On the outside of the west wing is a hole in the wall. Right around the corner inside is a stairwell. Sprint up and run by the dish. Im also pretty sure you can use an external stairwell closer to the dish. As for the other dish, just go there any time after the first 10 minutes of the raid and itll be clear. I mostly dont run into anyone doing this, just dont rush resort in the first 5 minutes and the chads will already be inside for the most part."
TornadoNada,"I had the same for Fishing Gear. It was 3 seconds for my last stashing and I got shot - 3 seconds...now I have to go on shoreline again, oh wait my weekly is survive 25 Shoreline anyway >.<"
Ternoxus,"3rd last map for the guide...
I think night shoreline and just go slow, first 5 seconds in pitch black headshot by m62.. I feel your pain.."
Gluckman47,Someday we could make a ritual in cult circles to cast diarrhea to PMC.
Mr_M3Gusta_,"Only 3rd try? Bruh that’s weak, try tarcone director 10 times. Hopefully I get it before my key wears out."
prUssian_gloriA_CA,"We all have been there.
Just keep going. That is the way it is meant to be."
Hallandsen1,"If you struggle with Signal pt 1 you must be doing something wrong. Wait a while before you go to resort. Let the bigggest chads finish looting. Go in through the fence from the West wing side. You dont even have to enter resort. I always finish it first try. Cant remember ever having trouble with it. Just take a moment and listen before you go. If you hear something, then wait, or walk slowly to the stairs outside before you sprint up."
brochochocho,What do you mean “to whoever” you can see the person’s name….
IRooman,Fuck to the guy who waited 25 minutes outside the resort fence just to one tap me after we killed 4 PMC-s inside.
Jaykwonder,"When i'm doing a light run to do these sorts of quests I ALWAYS forget to bring food and drink, which usually ends with me staggering to the exfil on the brink of death or just dying from exhaustion."
nattewindjes,Personally i love Shoreline. I also scav it a lot.
Jaquander,"Did Signal Part 1 yesterday, hid in a bush for 15 mins after radio station, there were 3 pmc corpses on west resort roof when I got there all unlooted, was a terrible sight."
dasimBaa,"You are better of doing it at daytime though, nightraids are littered with chinese names."
jovanisis,those are rookie numbers
keenhydra93,"Probably not me that shot you.. but I did kill a duo trying to do that task and I feel no regret, Punisher 4 is a bitch so two steps closer to being rid of that map."
M-Gnarles,"Why are people going on about Signal. At least that is  a quest that saves progression for you.

&#x200B;

Try Spa Tour 4 or Colleagues pt. 1

You have to go to the worst hotspots in the entire game or inside the main rooms in resort AND make it out alive or it does not count, in the same game.

&#x200B;

In signal you can just Timmy Truck it through the fallen fence and then sprint up the stairs, plant and voila, pain is over."
Competitive-Bell-962,"Yeah, trying to do wetwork 5 for 5 trys. 2 times someone sitting inside that room with shotgun. 2 times died someone camping in bush where you can exit resort and once killed 2 beefy ass pmc and died from exhaustion."
Wolf10k,My homie told someone that he hopes their breakfast is salty for a week.
kryndon,"It's by far one of the worst quests and maps in gaming history. You can't even visit the second spot before you visit Resort first, which is also dumb. And if you visit one and die, it doesn't stay checked.

Honestly the only realistic options are all cheeses. 

1. Run in completely naked at night time with gamma abuse and wait for the last ~15 or so minutes.

2. Run in at night time with just NVG gogs and a pistol, about 50-60k for this kit and you have a much higher chance of surviving.

3. Get carried.

4. Make a 4 man team and increase your odds.

I;ve hadd some success with option 2, but that's only if you've got lots of money you're ready to waste. Option 1 requires almost a full day of trying which at this point are you even having fun?"
Obsidian_mkULTRA,Did you have on a blue UN helmet? Were you over by the crane and had just looted 2 PMC bodies?
Edline1259,I've tried 6 times... Been on tarkov break for 2 weeks now
Acojonancio,"I'm about to try do this today, i think by reading that i will be jinxed."
xcentric211,What server lol
Saint0591,very XD!
LanikM,"Last night I had a guy keep saying friendly on VOIP.

I was helping my buddy task and I like to help newer players, especially ones who might be struggling and scared at resort, I hate shoreline. 

He kept moving closer as he was saying friendly and ignoring my questions and it was making me suspicious.

Sure enough I asked him why he was being sketchy and he was on the other side of the door and blasted me through it with 856A1.

Level 40. That's how he needs to get his kills.

I think I'm done being friendly."
Yeesh_,I’m doing signal now too. I got to weather and killed two scavs then had one lvl 50 chad pop me.
jusatinn,fUcK yOu FoR pLaYiNg ThE gAmE!1!1!1!1111
HostileGoose69,"I do most my find and extract quests first try like a chad, even though i might rat in a corner for 10 minutes first"
External_Ad_2325,"If you're a level 40 with an M4 who shot me going down the metal stairs from the dish, then fuck you too, otherwise you're welcome for killing a bastard!"
VelvetThunder2319,Cmon man don’t say things you can’t take back
HiddenSquid2020,Get 15 guys queue into IRL midnight servers then all press ready together. 8 of you will be in 1 raid the rest will be in pairs/thrips
b8ley,sorry bro
KDandhotdog,For stuff like this why aren’t you going in with a squad? I play solo myself but when I have shitty tasks like this I group with others from the EFT discord. 9/10 times get done easy peasy
yoloswagtrevor,Did you have a duo and was it T-46M or APM?
He1m2D3ep269,"Same to the guy who last night at around 00:34 that decided to blow my lung out of my body with his ps12b firing revolver, even after I shouted im just trying to do farming (pt1). I hope you enjoyed the pacca, 1911 and cheese slice lmao"
LurkeSkywalker,"Easiest way to do signal is hoping to spawn at rock bridge. You run straight to check the antenna at the weather station and than slowly walk north and enter the health resort by the far north fence. Once done, you exit to the far left norh fence and walk north to the wall and than left to path to lighthouse.

Any other spawn is dangerous with people crossing the map."
Fkingmeow,Lol I killed 2 guys who were both doing fisherman quest at the same time and I felt so bad immediately to the point where from that point on if I ever see someone doing it I'll leave them be and turn the other way
AlaskanJon907,r/rareinsults
DaleNightStick,Legit took me 13 tries to finish part 1. Even yelling out I’m just questing doesn’t work lolol
i-am-gumby-dammit,"Thats fucking harsh, dude."
HaZarD_SFD,Hit me up later if you have not done this today by 5pm EST.   I got a crew that will help you get the job done.
jnmann,"If you guys are trying to do these quests during daytime, you’re gonna have a bad time.  Just pistol run this shit during the darkness"
Kboehm,"Somehow I got that done 1st try, I did it offline a couple times to learn shoreline and then feel like I got lucky as there weren't many people in resort when I went up there and then boogied to path to lighthouse. Couldn't believe it was that easy haha."
Isiloki,"For whatever reason th killing quests with a twist (Pmc with a pistol, scav with a ironsight sniper from 40m+) took me forever but I oneshot Signal this wipe. I spawned in, got close to the resort where I afk'd 10 min to lunch and then ran to the roof, I heard 3 different players shooting at each other and even got to loot an unlooted one on my way. This area is filled with PMC at any time of the day, I just got lucky I guess"
Embarrassed-Theme915,"Wasn’t me, but I wish it was.  I need those scav vest kills."
Ok_Passage6526,I literally spawned in and ran probably a hundred meters and was one tapped last night. So I feel that. A lot.
MrRainbowCow,"Jesus I did this to someone around the same time, were you near a hill? Solo? Im sorry ily"
LEFUNGHI,I’ve been trying Part 3 for a few days now and keep getting killed bei either some bushwookies or hackers. Sad that it started on EU servers too now
Interesting-Bee-124,Go aT nIgHt….
thebananuhman,Only third huh?
ConsequenceRoyal1086,Wait where you going after two player scavs by a bus?
JSOCoperatorD,I hope the 120+ raids it took me to get my morphine and flash drives die in a fire.The amount of times I was shredded almost had me give up.
gt8888888,Whatd ya get shot with?
fifthg3n,I have a compilation of clips of dying trying to do signal part 1 this wipe. I feel your pain.
Competitive-Ad-4822,"Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge"
EisKohl,"Only third try... Sweet summer child...

I spent two dozen raids last wipe on some.shorekine quests xD"
ZaProtatoAssassin,"Third? That's rookie numbers, you gotta bump those up"
Ok-Plant-938,I camped sniper hill around the time that everyone was planting their snipers and hit my shooter born in a signal raid
_THORONGIL_,"Why do you care so much about karma? Care about the important things in your life and don't be a slave to social media. There are billions posts each day, it doesn't matter.

I don't mean that as an insult."
SoNElgen,"It's a weird sentiment that people think others should let them live, just because they're questing. 

FYI, most people questing on Shoreline need to kill PMCs with specific weapons and gear. Just saying."
gtighe,This was me trying to do bunker pt2 with nothing but a TOZ
khswart,Signal tasks were really easy for me luckily. The one where you have to mark the drugs with beacons fucked me repeatedly tho. There was someone camping at all the spots each time I wsnt
ListerOfSmeg92,Did signal today too. Bumped into a bloke on top of the roof and I had to yank my mouse to the right to get rid if a grenade mid throw. We used VoIP to agree to do our tasks and go our separate ways.
Kiiidx,I totally popped some guy last night about to walk up the metal stairs wearing a press vest. Presumably to do Signal pt. 1. If this was you im sorry lmao.
gohan924,From someone not involved. I hope every beer you drink is warm Mr headshot.
TNLNYHIM,"Man, I know how hard this hits. I have been sniper five times on woods while trying to get the Jaeger introduction quest done.

I hate woods with a passion."
MagicSceptre,"That's shoreline for you, I've never had this much trouble getting fir ledx, it's like every time rng is in my favor someone hunts me down so I can't get it out."
TNLNYHIM,"I keep hearing that, and yet, I've been on that map a total of 12 times, and survived once.

Every time, hostile pmcs shoot, I die. The last time the player was close enough to hear me let them know I was just there for the quest.
Still face shot me and laughed.
So NO, I don't like that map at all."
boofmydick,"I can't imagine being so scared and poor that I would drop a pistol because I don't want a player to loot it.

You're so bad at the game that you assume you will lose every encounter?

I saw someone do this once. I was showing my two completely noob friends around Customs and we had just cleared most of gas station from the nearby ledge when a player got our attention somewhere between us and checkpoint. Enemy PMC sprints up to the pylon and I follow them into the shed where they're just vomiting all of their gear onto the ground. I should've held my trigger and called the boys over to laugh at him instead of putting him out of his misery.

He could've at least tried to shoot one of us. Why even play this game?"
CAPTAINxKUDDLEZ,"Lol third try, you’re only 1/3 the way through all your tries to get it."
turdpurkle,"Just killed a level 1 who had a trooper, helmet m4, mp5 and pistol. Not even 3 minutes in."
NHReptiles,"Definitely wasn't me. I've been doing shoreline but I've yet to kill anyone there this wipe. Sometimes I wish there were more opportunities for non-combat encounters or teaming up, but the game isn't really designed that way and I'm not sure how you'd facilitate that without taking away some freedom. VoIP is great, but can't communicate at a distance. Maybe walkie-talkies or old ham radios you can loot?"
HoodPopeUno,"ngl def killed some timbobs out of reaction, even this straight naked level 48 dude which I am sure was just trying to extract lol thats Tarkov though"
ClaytorYurnero,Bro I was at the point of bartering a free SBiH kill to let me plant the jammers until I lucked out and got an empty raid.
wordhipster,Can't fail quests you don't accept my dude. Level 9 with over 8 million in the bank from being a good scavy boy.
lessthandandy,"Shoreline quests suck unless you have a group to takeover the raid or get a lucky near-empty night raid. Particularly now where a lot of the visit location quests need to be done in the same raid, you genuinely need to run across the whole map to get anything done.

If you have groups or get lucky though, it is a huge boon for loot and exp."
Aceylah,You only have to go back to shoreline 70 more times too.
Thundergameing,This is how I felt with the fishing task when someone domed me when I just got there lol
FanfairRITS,"Rip, I hate that experiance also who ever killed me in Factory f.u. while I was a scav, you dirty scav player,"
Riptide1737,"Worst part of early game quests are the people who have already done them. You join a week late and go to shoreline and chaddington and his squad are already sprinting around resort ready to rip you limb from limb for your gratch and hat even though they know you're just sprinting to the roof for signal. Please, just let us get these early quests done so we can play the game"
VoidSythe,I swear you have to be an NPC to write a post like this.
TheBobFisher,Were you on a night raid on EU North servers?
Ocleron,Was it me?
Tat2soupRhero,Were you running with a buddy? I was trying to get to the north drone early AF in the raid and stumbled upon 2 PMCs. Tapped one in the face and subsequently died to the other one.
Seralth,Dude that is the most cruel curse i think iv ever seen. You can't just curse someones pillow to be warm like that. Its not cool.
FluffleThePuff,"Were you a Blueberry running through an open field away from weather station towards radio tower and didn't see me standing 15 feet ahead of you? If so you deserved that.

I had fishing gear and health care privacy part 1 done if I left. Took no chances."
ElGuruDe,It will not be the only one quest qou run for multiple times  XD
Dizzy-Independence85,"Reddits so fucking cringe, the sub cries about people complaining and raging but will upvote a post like this…"
FrogMonkee,"Man I wish this maps quest would go suck an egg. They are all so, so shit."
