DHTGK,"Grounded has my favorite arachnophobia mode, where it's on a scale on how much spider vs spheres you want. Doesn't affect the gameplay, so as long as you also don't have the fear of shapes you should be fine."
Factory_Setting,Trust me. You don't need Ailurophobia to fear these cats...
MissedYourJoke,"I know I’m in the minority here, but I much prefer seeing the static cat heads bouncing around than the spiders, since they blend in with the terrain too well. I’m glad they have this mode available. I wish they could add that feature to all creatures, with different cat faces for each species."
skunk_jumper,And that's why there is the nuclear option for the nobelisks.
Madhighlander1,Honestly I think the floating PNGs of cats looming out at you from the darkness are scarier than the spiders.
andocromn,Good thing I'm only ailurophobic
i_eet_boo_d,The “cats” they decided to use are way more scary than the spiders
LurkerBeDammed,"God! I hate the Arachnophobia mode! Every once in a while out of game when I hear a cat meow now, I get a thrill of fear. LOL, I mean really, the mode made the spiders worse for me."
YueOrigin,To be fair the decapitated cat head are kinda creepy imo
Ankhst,"There is a great game about insects, where spiders are common enemies. The arachnophopia-modus just puts funny hats on them.    
It's the cutest shit ever."
cowtung,"If I didn't have ailurophobia before, I DO NOW"
factoid_,"I'm having serious baader meinhoff syndrome with the term ""ailurophobia"".  I had no idea what it was before last night... Now I've seen it twice in about 16 hours"
Jamesmor222,I don't have these 2 phobias but I fear big pixelated cat heads now
AC_Bradley,Why is it ailurophobia? Surely it'd be feliphobia and ailurophobia would be fear of pandas?
MonsterHunterJustin,"I think most people THINK they have arachnophobia when, in reality, they just don't particularly like spiders or think they are creepy. I'm willing to bet this is OP."
