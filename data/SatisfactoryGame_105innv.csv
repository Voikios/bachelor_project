Rheya_Sunshine,"Surprisingly... not a glitch. Two separate events that SEEM related and glitchy, but are not. 

The first one is the tractor getting stuck on the barriers on the road a bit, and then ghosting through it to continue on the path. This is a known response to auto-driving trucks and stuff getting stuck. 

The SECOND one is you going boom. That's something that just got released recently, in the form of Johnny the Jetpack Hog! Occasionally the hogs will spawn wearing a jetpack, and if they trigger on you they'll kamikaze, go boom, and drop the jetpack that allowed them to do it. Hence why you found a perfectly good jetpack lying there and got damaged on a lookout tower."
Sad_Recognition_1821,Looks like you just met Johnny
KraftyKick,Heeerrrrrreeeessss Johnny!
KittyCatGangster,"I have zero clue on what the hell happened here, I could pass off the death as just physics shenanigans... however, what utterly baffles me is the fact that somehow the black magic sacrifice ritual that tractor performed somehow created some sort of rift in the fabric of reality causing a Jetpack to just pop into existence... I haven't even gotten to jet packs on this save yet..."
JWSwagger,Clearly it was Dio
Schranus,"Oh, Johnny, you prankster you!"
Decent-Strain-1645,Heh I was gonna chalk it up to an assassination from a rival corporation hellbent on stealing from ficsit. They made a diversion with the truck and then launched a jetpack at you from behind a rock. Idk I tried lmao.
GaffJuran,"Iâ€™ve been attacked a few times by Johnny the Jetpack Hog, without ever seeing it, and I once found a discarded jetpack on the top of a mountain. If it wasnâ€™t for Reddit, I would never have guessed what it was."
aza9999,"What happened?

Scantraxx042,"You were not efficient enough just standing there. Therefore, The Ficsit cooperation terminated you(r contract)."

PaterMcKinley,That's what we Americans call a driveby
ICanBeAnyone,Guess the sugarcube just ain't sweet on ya.
Super_Cheburek,"Looks like you got sniped by a camper at the other side of the map

On a separate note, I believe Johnny should be nerfed. 100 hp damage aka one shot is way too much"
Qaetan,This is not a drill: Lord Klang has found their way to Satisfactory. I repeat: this is not a drill.
dork187,Clearly you just tried to hard and it was too smooth and cool looking for the game to allow you to love. Sorry mang!
SchopenhauersFeline1,Shouldn't have used tractors. Tractor God mad
expressly_ephemeral,I have thousands of hours in kerbal space program and this post made me worry that The Kraken had gone turbo and jumped games to satisfactory.
tsokiyZan,someone add a fart sound effect
ReluctantRecuse,Chuck Norris was on the hill behind you with a rifle. No scope.
SovietSkeleton,Not gonna lie I thought this was the slowest drive-by shooting.
ICANTTHINK0FNAMES,So thatâ€™s where the plasma spitterâ€™s fire balls go when Iâ€™m not looking.
Etherius,It appears someone launched a goddamned mortar at your position.
Jewsusgr8,This gave me such a  laugh! Thanks
Real_DanTDM44,You forgot to breathe so you hallucinated
EgoExplicit,Obviously its a cloaked predator hunting you.
sir_music,That was really funny
GustafTheGobbler,bro tripped
daemon377,"You used vehicles. 

What did you expect to happen?"
skypandaOo,Tractor got shy and went sonic speed to kill you and then return to its normal operations. Was so fast that you didn't even realize you were dead until after the tractor returned to it place.
MrUniverse1990,Looks like Johnny got you.
dwho422,Clearly someone in truck number 2 was hired to assassinate you. Maybe you should treat your AI pilots with more respect and they wouldn't pull over to let an assassin take a shot at you way up in your ivory tower.
