Skud_NZ,"A burn bag is a security bag that holds [sensitive or classified documents](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information) which are to be destroyed by fire or [pulping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulping) after a certain period of time. The most common usage of burn bags is by government institutions, in the destruction of [classified](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information) materials.

If anybody didn't know, I had to look it up myself"
PeriodicCulprit,"“This has been going on for years,” one former employee said."
tazebot,"Given that [Alito leaked the Hobby Lobby contraception opinion over dinner with christian activists](https://news.yahoo.com/justice-samuel-alito-leaked-hobby-162908718.html) who befriended him for the sole purpose of swaying his rulings, I think they are looking for leaks in the wrong places."
wubwub,"Pepperidge Farms remembers just a few years ago there were loud call to lock people up for doing work from personal emails...

Of course, those same people were silent before and after the lock-up calls when it was their people doing work from personal emails..."
imchalk36,"> The problem with the justices’ use of emails persisted in part because some justices **were slow to adopt to the technology** and some court employees were nervous about confronting them to urge them to take precautions, one person said. Such behavior meant that justices weren’t setting an example to take security seriously.

It’s time for term limits."
americanista915,I have worked for the US government twice. Once as a system analyst and the other as a cyber security position(can’t be too specific) and we had to do about 5 hours of yearly training on how to handle sensitive information. Cool to see the politicians who force us to do that fail their own rules. This illegitimate Supreme Court is a joke.
thistimelineisweird,Why are everyday Americans held to a higher standard than government officials? What insanity.
WaffleBlues,"When there is no accountability, and the people at the top have jobs for life, why would they bother with even the smallest inconvenience.

The SCOTUS justices are literally gods - non-elected, jobs for life with immense power, impossible to remove, no oversight or accountability."
therealbillgaetz,"Again, why are non-elected, ~~unimpeachable~~ officials allowed to change laws in this country???

Edit: I should say *very difficult to impeach*. TIL you can impeach SCOTUS judges. Here’s some more information for anyone interested:
> If a majority of the members of the United States House of Representatives vote to impeach, the impeachment is referred to the United States Senate for an impeachment trial. A conviction requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate.

PrajnaKathmandu,"""But Hillary's emails!!"" was always propaganda that the media willingly gave energy to--and along with Comey et al, helped elect the Putin stooge."
Hockeyhoser,Buttery males.
Nerney9,"Years ago I helped shift hospitals over from physical documentation to electronic medical records.  Nurses caught on quickly and adapted to the new workflows, while the absolute worst people to deal with were the older, veteran doctors.

These doctors were probably quite knowledgeable and obviously well experienced, but they already had their way of doing things and refused to learn anything else.  Often I'd see them just make a nurse to do it and not click the final signature button.  Which is an absolutely terrible way to handle patient records.

I can only imagine Supreme Court justices are even worse - after decades on the bench deciding what every single person in the country is allowed to do, pretty sure more than a bit of arrogant stubbornness sets in.

Term limits, ya'll."
Wolfman01a,"BuT tHeIR EmAiLs!

Hey Hillary haters.  Where are you at?   Come on now.  Fair and balanced, right?"
TintedApostle,So breaking regulations and policy.
SalsaBueno,Yeah the GOP has never actually cared about OPSEC or data control.
KickBassColonyDrop,"Lifetime appointments. Never been impeached. Ethical violations get a wrist slap. Fines are a joke. Supreme court appointments are like Presidencies. They're effectively extra legal.

I'm shocked anyone else is shocked."
GenXUser,Conservatives are selfish and corrupt. It's who they are.
Marciamallowfluff,Remember when people thought computers would eliminate paper use and handling?
dangerzone2,"What is with people using their personal email???!! Most of us here have personal and work emails, and I bet damn close to 100% have never sent business emails through personal account. This is doubly important with a job dealing with sensitive data."
Atrocity_unknown,But her emails!!
TheManWhoWasNotShort,"I’m a bit hesitant to believe that SCOTUS can or should keep anything secret, and I’m more concerned about the existence of burn bags than their lack of security.

Of all the branches of government, the need for transparency from SCOTUS is absolutely paramount.  I don’t like the secrecy"
tykneedanser,"So, lock them up?"
CooterSam,"My employer and I, personally, can get insane fines and possible jail time for HIPAA breaches yet somehow members of government can't even get a slap on the wrist for being loose with super classified documents."
Ixneigh,Cue Republican outrage in…never.
Marciamallowfluff,All our public officials need to take security more seriously.
rothotindisguise,So charge them all
Medical_Cake,"No discipline, that is concerning"
Raspberry-Famous,"""The janitors don't have authorization to go into the secure side so we just leave our trash cans full of sensitive documents sitting out in the hallway for them.""

It's incredibly stupid and yet I've seen it multiple places.

Where I'm working now there's a back door that has one of those CAC card readers on it and you pretty much need a signed letter from God to get put on the access list. Yet a bunch of people need to get in and out through that door to do their jobs so the facilities guys pop the breaker and the door just sits open all the time.

Security is surprisingly hard to get right."
Nomad47,"It is important for our American friends who watch Tucker Carlson to understand that Mr. Carlson is, in fact, exposing them to Marxist-Leninist propaganda that is *identical* to the anti-American propaganda of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The cort is rigged and anti-democratic."
AbaloneDifferent5282,"One of the many reasons they have a 7% approval rating. And personally, I think 7% is high"
2OneZebra,Wait until they find out their personal email accounts have been hacked.  It's coming.
mrpanicy,Sounds like their personal email accounts should be open to freedom of information requests then.
cdsmith,"This is what happens when you tell people they have to jump through hoops to protect ""secret"" information that doesn't actually have a reason to be secret.  Nothing about how the Supreme Court writes its publicly released decisions needs to be secret.  If you asked the staff to follow precautions with specific cases where there are state secrets involved or such things, I'm sure they would be more careful.  But if you tell people that everything including the email you send wishing someone a happy birthday is super secret, of course they will be lax about the secrecy protocol."
Haymaker969,"I work in a 911 dispatch center for a small town, we handle confidential criminal histories, warrants etc. We keep the burn bags locked up very tight."
ksknksk,"The whole fucking government is just lazy and chooses ease over proper regulations.

Pathetic. They really are above all the laws and such. We need major change."
ragingclaw,bUt HiLlArY's EmAils!!!
Ok_Effective_2536,Can we make them all work at McDonald’s? Clearly they aren’t capable of the responsibility bestowed upon them.
BabyYodaX,The Roberts Court is a fucking disaster.
Who_DaFuc_Asked,I'm convinced that conservatives are *intentionally* leaving evidence where it can easily be stolen
eaunoway,But their emails!
ivey_mac,Perhaps the burn bags are used as barf bags after keggers with Squee and PJ. Closed barf bags are no bueno after playing devils triangle with the boys
achyshaky,Will anything be done? No? Cool.
PeaceFrog71x,Not surprised. SCOTUS has no official Code of Ethics.
OrgyOfMadness,"You don't fucking say... or as I've heard many times before ""rules for thee, not for me..."
Ok-Ease7090,The US government is a joke
Content-Tea-2526,Maybe there was not a leak. Maybe someone was just really careless.
scienceismygod,With security issues like what we've had lately no one else really needs their own spy's.....
coollord789,Supreme court is a joke nowadays.
quesadilla79,and nothing is going to happen to anyone. #JustPlucocracyThings
tyleritis,This is why I can’t believe in government conspiracies. We’re just too incompetent
Arcadian1,Welp. Time to give them the Hillary treatment.
djazzie,"JFC, can anyone in our government properly take care of sensitive documents?? Why are they all so damned incompetent?"
the-hottest-of-damns,"Omfg at my job I have to fill out a form to spend even $5 and follow all kinds of strict regulations, and these guys are just tossing sensitive shit into the hallways. Arrrrgh!!!"
Ivorcomment,Yet they don't know how the Roe v Wade leak occurred? Perhaps Kavanaugh and some of his associates celebrated Friday evening with a few too many beers.
buttergun,Justice Roberts runs a pretty tight ship.
Great-Heron-2175,Sounds like our whole government is doing a great job lately.
WoozyMuon,"Hell... one of their wives is a terrorist sympathizer who wants to overthrow the American government...

What's a couple of misplaced 'secrets' among traitors, eh?"
PickledTires,I wonder if Clarence has burn bags for his massive porn collection.
AdvF07,Coming up next on Fox: Did Hunter Biden’s laptop leak?
Balgat1968,"To determine who leaked the decision, they checked all of the sign-in logs on the fax machines."
captaincanada84,I love buttery males
Potatonet,"If they can do whatever they want then we can do whatever we want

It’s only fair"
Healthy_Jackfruit_88,Who watches the Watchmen?
BennyWithoutJets,Welp. That’s probably where the leak came from. This belongs in r/leopardsatemyface
McNuttyNutz,Well  of coarse they did
23370aviator,I’m pretty confident I know which ones did and didn’t do this.
MachineCode86,Won’t someone please think of the buttery males!!
alienboatswain,but her emails
anguslee90,"I get it, why inconvenience Russian intelligence by using secured emails?"
dickeydamouse,Bro. Can we stop with this sloppy ass handling of sensitive shit?
psu777,They used their personal email servers?  Let’s have hearings on that!!
MK5,"Uh huh, sure. Not going to change the fact that Alito purposefully leaked the overturning of Roe months early to 'immunize' GOP candidates during the '22 midterms. Thanks for the Red Trickle, Sam."
Starkiller006,"I'd literally get fired for leaving PII on my desk, but yeah who cares right?"
Neekovo,I’m confused. Does the SCOTUS handle classified information?
idontagreewitu,Is there anybody in the government who HASN'T MISHANDLED CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS at this point?
BadAtExisting,"So Alito leaked

Also, not at all surprising “many of them were resistant to the technology” this is a byproduct of appointment for life"
ArminTanz,Can we stop putting 80 year old men in positions of power.  They don't understand the technology.
that_guy_jimmy,Jfc is there one person in government that understands how security works?
FUMFVR,"> The problem with the justices’ use of emails persisted in part because some justices were slow to adopt to the technology and some court employees were nervous about confronting them to urge them to take precautions, one person said.

Dictators is robes strike again."
C-ute-Thulu,"If I used my personal email at work, I'd get fired --- quickly"
_GigaChad_,"No way! Another unqualified career politician/official with no training to handle sensitive information mishandles sensitive information? Shocking. 

Almost like we should be holding the people who control our way of life to higher standards."
FuckedUpRetort,">some justices were slow to **adopt** to the technology 

Typo?"
HookEm_Hooah,"Fucking privates. Oh, Federal Officials. Fucking privates."
Heylookanickel,They leave it out intentionally so that way they can give their party the information
Hav3_Y0u_M3t_T3d,"Huh, it's almost as if a permanent unaccountable branch of government doesn't give a shit about rules or regulations"
abfanhunter,"The rules don't apply to certain people like Biden, Trump, Hillary, and Justices.... Can we stop spamming this garbage and go back to our circles."
HypnoticONE,"No more ""tradition."" Write this shit into law."
Catsmak1963,"lol 
“Secrets”"
Protonbox22,Watch nothing happen and the subject changes with zero resolution.
XpertDestroyer,The leaks were coming from inside the house
AnalSoapOpera,Lmao. They claim someone leaked it and do dumb shit like this.
alexbeeee,But Hillary’s emails! /s
nopersh8me,"Don't worry they paid someone in just the past few years to address security failings. This guy- 

""Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff reviewed and endorsed the Supreme Court’s internal investigation into the leak. However, the court did not disclose Chertoff had been paid at least $1 million in recent years to perform security assessments for the court.

The court declined to comment."" 

See,  no funny business here.  

^/s"
idownvotelife,hiLaRy eMaiL SeRVRz
L480DF29,"Ah the ol’ Hillary, eh?"
SuperGenius98K,The burn bags are handled by Putin's people?
Potch660,"Buttery males, Supreme Court edition"
boogadabooga2,Do these places even have an SSO? Jfc this is ridiculous.
Avant-Garde-A-Clue,Our institutions are a joke. SCOTUS is run by religious fossils bought and paid for by amoral fossils with money.
clunkenmcculkin,"Whenever I read ""Supreme Court"" I think ""wtf are those Americans up to now""?"
mickstranahan,Lock. Them. Up?
foggy-sunrise,"Can we just like, swap em all out?

Clean house?

Replace em with a bunch of 40 year olds. Make new laws, 10 year max. Can't start after age 50."
lawyer1911,"Lock them up! Well, Alito and Thomas.  Brett too."
Snarkyunicornhusband,Boomers gonna boomer.
Garciaguy,"Omg! Omg! Another ""sources say"" article! My God, this is incredible!"
Such-Armadillo8047,"The ""Supreme"" Court isn't the CIA, NSA, U.S. military, or even FBI (sensitive criminal investigations). Aside from maybe some death penalty cases or the FISA court (foreign **classified** intelligence surveillance act), I'm highly skeptical this Article III branch of government has anything actually sensitive or top-secret that shouldn't be made public ahead of time without harm (aside from ruining its already non-existent reputation). 

If security was this bad, no wonder they loved being opaque for all these years (I'm not that old anyways)--say from 2005 when Roberts became Chief Justice to before COVID-19 lmao."
Ok-Salt-615,Tho
W_Anderson,"Goddamn traitors everywhere…we need corporations out of our fucking government, ASAP."
MoreDoughHigh,"Why would SCOTUS use burn bags? The only classified info that a court gets is in federal district court inside a SCIFF by AUSAs with TS/Comp clearance and criminal defense lawyers with those clearances as well. Federal circuit courts of appeal and SCOTUS deal with legal, not factual, issues for appeal and no laws are classified. So, I'd like an explanation as to why the highest court would burn or shred documents."
forgotmyusername4444,Gonna have to fire and replace them all
CloudTransit,"To understand this story, it’d be necessary to understand the secretive work the Court does.  Would it be oversight of FISA or sealed orders that we’re worried about?  Otherwise, a lot of the Court’s work is very public and based on existing court records.  Who cares which ghost-slave-founder Alito or ACB was quoting to help out a hateful bakery owner. that got edited out?"
SoftTacoSupremacist,There needs to be some oversight of these scofflaws.
spacebetween22,Lock them up!
ooouroboros,They are effectively doing the work started by Ronald Regan of drowning our government in the bathtub.
CraftyPerformance423,Que… Lock em up!
Paige_Maddison,Personal emails… now where have I heard that outrage before? Hmm 🤔
Temporary_Top5426,Seems like the Supreme Court isnt so Supreme
oldmancornelious,Burn them at the stake( metaphorically). These fucking imposters need to be dethroned.
NothingButAJeepThing,hire clowns and get a circus
Il1Il1Il1,i'm shocked these shit diaper wearing fossils know how to use email
WritingRites,Don't worry. There will be a peer reviewed investigation amoungst themselves into the matter soon.
Hemingwavy,Glad to know the fucking idiots infesting the Supreme Court don't bother using security because they find it hard.
Necessary_Row_4889,"It’s all Squee and Doggers fault, they were doing a Devils Triangle with Brett, which is totally a drinking game and not a weird sex thing, and those knuckleheads said they would properly dispose of the burn bag. Trouble is they also like beer, and, well, time makes fools of us all."
Dalmahr,"Youd be surprised how many people use their personal emails for sensitive information. They find their work email too ""restrictive"" lol"
Substantial_Sun_8477,"Lol of course they don’t want privacy laws. Just leave it open. I bet they don’t go through phishing training. I mean, which of the Justices still use dial-up at home? Who has an aol email?"
HeavensToBetsyy,"Lol no one takes this illegitimate court seriously a single bit. Live with that Roberts, you absolute failure"
Dreamtrain,lock em up?
mynamejulian,"If true, and there’s no denial, the justices should each face trial"
KingGalapagos,Lock them up!
KingRandal,Lock em’ up!
mack180,Wow
WineSoda,Huge Law office I worked for used locked shedder bins that were then picked up by a local school for the blind to be shredded. No human looked at the documents once they went in the bin.
powersv2,Time to charge them
ThaxReston,The doucheBag supreme shitCourt ?
idknemoar,"TBH, this issue is across all levels of the court systems down to the local levels.  Local PDs have to email warrants to hotmail and yahoo addresses of judges to get them signed off on regularly completely disregarding/violating Criminal Justice Information Systems (CJIS) policies, but no one calls it out cause otherwise the process of getting their warrants would grind to a halt and America runs on incarcerating it’s citizens."
nifty_fifty_two,"Classifying documents makes sense.

Burning them doesn't.

I understand this isn't a new thing or unique to America or anything, but I feel like record should be kept somewhere of everything the government does."
AccordingPin53,Shock
spacewalk__,"ok yeah they're fucking idiots and hogs, what's new 

fix the fucking country or retire"
WrongSubreddit,What would stop them? They're not accountable to anyone
neutral-chaotic,Offenses that would mean jail time for us normies.
DepletedMitochondria,Shocker.
I_likemy_dog,"Not surprised. 

Look at our government and top secret documents. Look at Enron or FTX. Go even farther back and Iran-contra, and the CIA shipping cocaine into this country while our government pumped millions into things like DARE. 

Nobody holds them accountable and they just all shrugging their shoulders and go “oh well” when they are caught. They project the idea that it’s okay to lie, cheat, and steal as long as you’re a big enough bully."
haunted-liver-1,"Since when is it bad that the supreme court is transparent?

Shouldn't the narrative of this story be berating the Supreme Court for trying to hide things from the public that they serve?"
KevinCarbonara,Does anyone know if they have the same requirement to avoid personal emails as do members of the executive branch?
