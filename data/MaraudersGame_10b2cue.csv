SolidSufficient2668,Show that trench gun some love soon
emodemoncam,You don't need so many shitty guns. I'd recommend phasing them out for heavier caliber weapons and save up on ammo for them.
brinaldi15,r u killing a lot of players for all those guns or just looting and leaving ?
LingromR,A fellow ppsh connoisseur I approve and also keep 2-3 in backup. Just in case.
frenchfriedtatters,Just gonna say the .300 guns are my favs.
gunnermingo,Reising slaps hard
bumf94,is the dp any good now?
nsfwysiwyg,"You need to make some space in that stash to receive rewards when the market trades come back up. Switch those small for large containers and you should have enough space to fold & store your backpacks as well.

I currently have 6 large and 2 compact with enough free space for 2 MG42s and a bit to spare... extra bags go in ship storage space, but if I overflow I just put my next loadout into the extra bag so I can just ""bug-out"" when I die (craft a plate rig, throw on the bag, grab some meds and lockpicks and just go)."
