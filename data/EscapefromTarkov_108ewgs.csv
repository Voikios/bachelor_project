xRamee,"If you see this again, shoot them in the bottom of their legs/feet. Upper body you can‚Äôt get any hits to register.

Then flying like that isn‚Äôt full godmode, it just fucks with the hit box."
1stMembrOfTheDKCrew,"If they are RMTing, its probably in their best interest to avoid lobby wiping.

If they dont kill anyone, they dont really get reported. 

I doubt its because he is nice, if you had altyn/slick he would probably kill you."

atled6,"Try and kill cheaters every time. You die, but they get reported. Without reports they don‚Äôt get banned as quickly"
mochiai,LMAO. Next time this happens start screaming gibberish and run around looting while ignoring him until he kills you. The worst thing is you lose a loadout but you get to report him.
hooblyshoobly,"All cheaters are mouth breather cunts. I dislike the few posts over the past week or so referring to cheaters who are 'nice' or 'helping out' by only killing cheaters... apparently.

If you cheat, you ruin the integrity of the game whether you kill people or not. Someone justified his friends cheating because he only loots and doesn't kill people, said he 'has no time to grind as he works long hours'. So the other people in the lobby who also work deserve to not find any fucking loot? SMH."
halationK,"Had a guy in my game floating like this. He didn‚Äôt take any damage and was moving just like that with his leg bent. That means he‚Äôs cheating right? No way it‚Äôs a bug?

I ask because I added him and he denied cheating and that ‚ÄúI claim anyone that kills me is a cheater‚Äù. I can link a clip [here](https://imgur.io/3bGuyYa)"
plantbreeder,I'd get killed here just so i can report them
Anoreth,"Not prepared to normalize cheaters because some of them are nice.   
Fuck them, and fuck that."
TheCrankyGamerOG,"Dude that is cheating is 100% Dutch.

Edit : i also notice more and more that Dutch are over represented in this group, and i got no clue why.
Is it an age thing? It can't be socioeconomic."
PigasusGaming,They're definitely not being nice. They're just avoiding giving you their IGN so you can't report them
Dazbuzz,"They are cheating, so they are already not nice. Just think of it like you took advantage of them, rather than died for nothing. Not a big deal."
HighlightFun8419,"Fuck every cheater that reads this. 

*shame and dishonor to your whole fucking families.*"
Aingz1,"They are doing that so they don't need to kill anyone, so they don't get reported, he's probably doing a carry, and that way he will have the entire server for him and his 'customer'"
Traditional_Lab1340,"Been expecting him to continue with ""you live in 41¬∞24'12.2""N 2¬∞10'26.5""E, in this room, i can see you shaking and i have all your credit card info"". Eft cheaters are insane nowadays tho"
imtoohai,"Jfc, when is BSG gonna spend the money on a real anti hack system?"
SquillChills,Damn that guy is a guaranteed virgin
TheFlabbs,"A cheater tried killing me with a grenade near rock passage on Shoreline recently. When he failed and I hid in a good spot, he just sprayed at my location from the other side of the hill crest we shared. Just spray after spray of bullets hitting the ground near me because he kept trying to quickly one-tap me while popping his head over the hill crest. 7.62 BP of course. Pre-firing mag after mag. When he realized he couldn‚Äôt kill me without it being too obvious, he just broke both of my legs and gave me three heavy bleeds in silence. Left me alone after that. No clue why they‚Äôre behaving erratically, something must be up. It seems like they really don‚Äôt want people being able to report them"
ItsAxeRDT,"fuck it if BSG cant fix the cheater issue then charge my account for 20$ which requires my ID and phone info as well so I get to play on exclusive prime servers.

&#x200B;

The cheaters are clearly winning the arm race with anti-cheat companies. ""get new anti-cheat, fix the current anti-cheat"" clearly neither is gonna work anyway  shit I can send them my blood type and all personal doc info as well, doubt cheaters would care about doing all of this :p"

randomredditguy999,Hes Dutch. Clear as day.
sleepy_the_fish,A 72 headshot percentage.  OP is a Chad
Pierr0x,"Maybe cheaters have reached what I call ""critical mass"". There are so many cheaters, they kind of have to start being nicer to normal players or they'll depopulate the game so much its going to end up in a Hacker vs Hacker only game."
xxJim,what the fuck...
evel-kin,"it's best to get the cheater to kill you, that way you can report him and send the clip to bsg ..."

Muffin__Stuffer,I'm not certain but I think that's guys cheating.
No-Carry-7886,"Same happening to me, they float and gift an item or two, protect from other cheaters, and are off."
poopedstatue117,I would have baited them into killing me to report their dumb asses.
Hendo_AU,"And this is why I don't play this game anymore, it's just infested with cheaters and BSG is doing nothing about it."
shredthesweetpow,You should‚Äôve gone full terrorist.
n0dda,"Instead of banning them, after say 5 reports they are force to cheater only servers and they can fight each other. Doesn‚Äôt stop RMT but at least they aren‚Äôt killing legit players"
DelugeFPS,"I have ran into a few people on servers with cheaters who started 'counter cheating' specifically to fuck over the cheater.. but this is very rare.

&#x200B;

I'm willing to bet if you had better gear this dude would've killed you."
zfancy5,Lol. What a joke game
mightyapplepie,Of course he is Dutch...
youngboygohan,"next time just unload on him and die to him, that way you‚Äôll be able to report him"
Kuyi,The thing that pisses me off the most is I can hear from the accent it‚Äôs a fellow Dutch guy‚Ä¶ Hope BSG bans him twice.
omarch92,it has more cheaters than players nowadays
OpportunityNo1318,"This is a Dutch cunt. I can hear the dialect. 
Shoot them next time. If they die, great, if they don‚Äôt, you can report them."

inspired_by_retards,"I had a player wipe out everyone in lighthouse and gave me all the gear then told me to kill him to increase my scav karma, looking back that guy must've been a ""nice"" cheater or something"
Nielsvandijkje,Wow cheater sounds Dutch‚Ä¶ never knew the dutch cheats.
00000000000000000099,"How long until it's revealed BSG sells the cheats themselves? 

You can't convince me otherwise."
Schkywalker,"The way this dude knew all about you is so scary.

I also legit chuckled when he came out levitating like a transcended yoga master level 99."
ThisisNari,"I said it once and I'll say it again, if BSG refuses to do anything about it, then I don't see any other option than to have at least one player in every lobby be cheating and go cheater hunting while the rest of the lobby plays their normal raid."
CheesecakeDiscoParty,Surprised this post is still up- every time I post a video of blatant cheaters the mods remove it. Funny how they hide the most broken part of the game that BSG refuses to fix. Cant wait until a competitor to this game shoves EFT out of the spotlight and succeeds where this is failing in so many ways.
DisGruntledDraftsman,"It's disappointing how much of the community is now supporting cheaters. 2 years ago good, bad, or other, they would have been burned alive. Now people think you can be a good guy cheater, how delusional they are."
AverageMetalConsumer,All these fucking morons talking bout they've never seen a cheater....well here you fucking go shut the fuck up please.
ShiddyWidow,How utterly embarrassing that he can read your fucking stats. Unbelievable trash devs.
helpmepleas1,"Bruh think about what Rosa Parks would‚Äôve done, or Martin Luther king jr. I would‚Äôve had them just kill me cuz I‚Äôm not cucking out to some cheaters."
FlyPenFly,The heroes we need and don‚Äôt want.
steelejt7,EFT needs coop offline fr
Arteqt,"We need community moderation at this point.

Select community moderators. Let them watch replays. They flag cheaters with timestamp on replay. Nothing happens until BSG checks the replay. Problem solved.

Active moderation is the only way to keep cheats out of FPS games. There is nothing you can do on software side to prevent it."
samwelches,If you didn‚Äôt comply they would have killed you any everyone else anyway. Not your fault they chose to be pieces of shit
nOobeynoodleman,Man had all his character info doxed over voip lmao
pancakeface101,Sad this game is like this. Wish somebody would come along and make a game like this without cheaters and Russian owners
Helian7,I would have said just kill me so I can report you.
OK_1M_REL0ADED,"Eh, doesn't matter.

kekbab,aim for the legs next time

Raikohhh,"Little man think he's powerfull coz he cheats, damn"
ShadowPancake47,the floating guys you can kill only by shooting in the legs btw
kglfish,just got killed on interchange by someone making no step sounds when he peaked. Now I know what it was thanks
oriaven,"Let them escort you and voip report them ,it's in the YY voice menu."
hybrid_earth,Unload full auto into their legs and they'll die. You can get their tag and report them.
killer-fish,"I would kill him or get him to kill me. You were recording, you could have reported him with video evidence."
Jamie7718,I have only just found this out from watching treys video. But the guys that fly like that. Shoot them in the feet and they die.
Secretninja35,"I think you can report voice coms. He didn't let you live out of kindness, he just doesn't want you to see his name or click that report button (not that reporting does a goddamn thing)."

Ivandragosgopnikson,"Next time you see a floating cheater, shoot them in the legs. They will take damage to the legs with this exploit."
Chaos744,I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs happening here.
Dread_411,"BSG made 90+ million last year and cheaters bring in alot of money maybe thats why they are maybe neglecting the amount of hackers running around that being said i know they do ban waves and ban from reports but its just not enough, played for 4 years currently level 32 and im not even going to bother logging back in this wipe due to the scale of hacking im experiancing its really destoryed my mental state, also im not saying everyone is experiancing this just my own"
REMELLgg,Lmao video game cheaters‚Ä¶sounds fun
Ryan_jpg,"I mean its almost impossible to get caught with the current system, unless you go around wiping people. Its honestly stranger how many cheaters are just killing people right now IMO"
Most_Log1612,I saw a thing about cheaters hunting cheaters. I like this idea lol
Initial-Coach5706,my pride could never
thispartyislame,I once had a hacker on Shoreline call out the armor I was wearing (hex I found in a stash) and told me to go back and loot a lion from a stash he could see. He said he was a friendly hacker that only killed other hackers. I was very torn.
Menace_Mk7,Lmao will Battlestate ever acknowledge this shit?
Stonedfiremine,"Don't be nice to these mfer. Kill this guy or try as much as you can. Hes acting nice so he can ruin the game and get away with it. If you don't report, they won't get banned."
frank0420cs,Report thru voip next time
70monocle,It's a power trip for them. When they get bored of wiping lobbies and ruining days they can continue getting off by fulfilling their savior fantasy. They are just as much assholes
DrHighlen,This is sad
God_of_the_Vapes,"Ive been playing for 3 or 4 wipes off and on and Ive never been the best player. Every item Ive gotten Ive earned by playing the game, just like every other player. Why do these kids get to pay for a bodyguard throughout a raid."
,[removed]
DopeyLo420,That ‚Äúwe need to go‚Äù sure sounded alot like ‚ÄúI fucked up and feel a ban coming real soon. We need to hurry‚Äù ü§£üíÄ
BrickShelter,This should be bannable.
Ambientus,Cheaters are just the main symptom to a bigger issue; Bads using real money to buy shit.
PALMpje,"what a douchebag, i can tell that cheater is dutch like me and that makes me even more hate him. stop ruining games cheaters!!"
ItzYaBoiQuez,Well damn dad.
da-pets-mode,Scum of the earth 100%
Commiesstoner,It's amusing how these kinds of cheaters pop up at the start of the wipe every time but reports disappear by the second month.
HorseThief84,Probably just trying to preserve their account for as long as they can. Maybe their line of reasoning is if they are nice you might be less likely to report them.
Scout079,"Nice cheaters out here not killing?

Must mean that the Anti-Cheat is working enough to limit their numbers. Or the report function is so good that they rather not risk the report."
Mad-All-Day,Losers.
medkitjohnson,Damn 72% he got that laserbeam on him!
JohnnyxKwest,Lmaoooo well that was both nice and scary at the same time lol
Affectionate_Gas_264,Cheaters tend to turn nice when they realise the player base is dropping off due to them ruining the game and want to keep victims to play against
Memphetic,"My response would be ""lmao gfy, I'm recording. Kill me so I can report you.""

It takes one decent raid to make a million roubles and your entire kit back - satisfaction of not being told what to do is worth the death to me."
shashungyo,"BSG should hire people to actively moderate. 
  
Like go in raids and being able to watch people, while it may not be effective as a anti cheat it would be a good deterrent"
PM_THAT_PUSSY,"wtf this happened to me on streets, dude called me trash cuz of my survival rate and said dont bother just leave, and i started barking in the voip and he said ""Buddy...im not trying to kill you, we just want to get to extract"" so i told him ""thats cool, considering the extract is literally behind me"" and after a few more back and forths when he realized i wasnt intimidated by all the info he had on me, he killed me through a wall and i reported him. I dont expect anything to come from that report, but my epeen was erect for hours afterward."
ThexanR,You can‚Äôt report him if he doesn‚Äôt kill you.
DiMarcoTheGawd,"This isn‚Äôt nice. The guy wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúpolitely asking‚Äù you even though that‚Äôs what he said. He was telling you what to do in a game you paid money for, with the implied threat that he can ruin your experience if he wants to. He can fuck right off."
_BlueTinkerBell_,"Its been like this for about a year now, i give up on tarkov maybe i'll comeback when it comes out of 20 years beta but for now there's just too many cheaters and glitches..."
Anxious-Contract5969,Never work with cheaters. Always resist and always try and get their info to report them. Play nice to a degree but never leave them uncontested.
twitch-superc00l,"wheres the one guy, "" i played 5000 hours and never seen a cheater."" Now they float, lmaoooooooo"
LookAliveTV,Its sad that I can hear that he is Dutch. Makes me sick of my own people.
Euphoric_Lock9955,"I like this, basically like having admin/mods in every game. We are at the Jugde dread phase of this issue. Please can we give these anti cheating cheater guys immunity from bans."
LinkovH,One cheater hit me two times in the faceshield and then I told them I was there for quests and they guarded me while I was fixing the boards and getting the letter from the dead scav prop. Not sure how I should feel about it... tbh I never get mad when I die because of someone cheating idk why. When someone is ratting and gets me in the back is more annoying personally
Scarface_Forever,With the sudden and seemingly massive wave of cheaters lately? I've been having a blast. There was one cheater I came across who was practically playing a food vendor on shoreline.
jethrox0131,The honorable way would be to kill them when they least expected it.
PckMan,"I've seen ""nice"" cheaters in other games but not in Tarkov. I remember back when GTA V came out for PC initially it was very common to find people in lobbies just handing out money and items to people, which was a nice change of pace from those who would absolutely destroy a lobby, or in some cases be able to steal your money and cars which you'd just straight up lose and not get back after leaving the lobby. 

I'm not entirely sure if people are trying to RMT more effectively by using different strategies or building good will or what or if they simply get a power trip out of it but still it's incredibly rare that you meet nice cheaters. Most of them are just hesitant to straight up kill everyone because they get a lot more reports their way like that. Honestly I think there should be a way to report the server play list post match, like with a post match replay. So if for example you see a blatant cheater but for some reason they don't kill you you can at least run the match replay back with names visible and report them that way."
StigerKing,"FUN FACT, IF THEY ARE FLYING YOU CAN ONLY KILL THEM BY SHOOTING THEM IN THE LEGS!"
lota7,He wants you to leave on your own so he doesnt have to kill you and give up his name and thus be reportable.
Spilge,I'd have shot whoever he was with at the last second
Domoisback,"*after calling out your home address, social insurance number and mother‚Äôs maiden name* ‚ÄúI would politely ask you to leaveüòä‚Äù"
ReturnOfTheJuJu,This cheater is 100% Dutch as fack haha I recognise the accent a million miles away..
szzaass,Not sure which key is it but I think it‚Äôs ‚ÄúY‚Äù. Hold it and among the options there‚Äôs a ‚Äúreport voice chat‚Äù. You do that and keep them talking.
JollyReading8565,"I just like that now , whenever I die I can say to myself ‚Äúmeh probably a SUBLE cheater‚Äù lmao"
ratjoch123,"Fucking dutch guy, what a cunt."
thekins33,"I guess i got moved into the cheater lobbies cuz HOLY FUCK this week has been HORRIFICALLY BAD in terms of cheaters.....

first raid today after work within 30 seconds of spawning perfect nade hits me in the forehead......

second raid in chased and no matter what bush/building/youname it i put between us there he was chasing me down.....

2 raids with no cheaters what do you know i survived easily 

then i went to shoreline...... WOW just wow.... I know the cheaters are ridiculous early wipe they always have been but just.... wow I thought last wipe was bad"
tegraze,"They are being ""nice"" because if they kill you, then you can easily report them. This is just to delay being banned as much as possible and increasing their profit for the carries."
Got_yayo,How is that fun?
DavidisGamingHD,This game is in an embarrassing state.
cheated_in_math,"Posts like this need to be banned/deleted

This is just advertisement for cheats"
Ok-Life8294,"Most cheaters wont kill you unless they have to. But if ur cool they'll be cool with you.

Then other times they just wipe entire lobbies lol"
noahsark02,Met a cheater on labs. One tapped the lobby except me and my friend because we where obviously not cheating he said üòÇ said we could have the loot and he was just going into raids to kill cheaters üòÇ thank god I suck üòé
Elliotvital,Wtf is this bullshit. What pussy is so ducking fragile they need a cheater to escort them in a VIDEOGAME. FFS what happened to competition I mean why even play the game if you don‚Äôt want to compete and just want everything handed to you my god
SolitaryVictor,I would have killed one of them and attempted to kill the others as well and would be happy even if I died. Bonus points if you determine who they were guarding and start with him first.
HasSomeSelfEsteem,You‚Äôre basically a collaborator is all I‚Äôm saying
SuperRektT,Honestly? At least he was kind to you and didnt kill. Others talk to you and then kill you like scumbags.
KardelSharpeyes,Fucking losers hope they rot in hell.
