Fun_Finger6507,Nah clearly the scav is military trained and the uhhh adrenaline is pumping through
JebstoneBoppman,RIP that scav's arms and legs
FTierLogiPilot,Yeah looks like a skill issue.
Iiana757,"Arm, leg, leg, thorax"
HubesUS,"It’s tough man, the scav groans after every round mean you hit your shots but you need to aim for chest and head"
MekkiNoYusha,All bullets on fingers and toes
DabScience,This is why I run full autos. Don't need to aim when you can mag dump lol.
yaboicyno,"Shots 1-1: Clearly missed.

Shots 2-2: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).

Shots 3-3: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.

Shot 4: Likely didn't actually fire because you were already dead."
Wh000ey,Why…won’t… you…DIE?!!?
R3alityGrvty,"It looks like you just hit each of his limbs once tbh, otherwise I don’t see how he could’ve lived."
deep6x,Try holding the right side of the tree next time
WinBigPlayer,with that ammo you should take your time and aim for the head.
BorisIsHereBois2344,Man i almost punched through my screen last night i was doing the damned pocket watch quest met a scav right by ruaf roadblock shot him in the head 2 times he was behind rubble so i couldn't have hit anything else and my guy proceeds to tank it all and kill me and because bsg decided hmm lets make quest keys 1 durability it fucks you over so bad  like why would they make it a 1 durability key for some quests when its not even that easy to get like out 5 raids i went to dorms all of them somone rushed in after me and killed me
psychedelicstairway4,"Should aim for thorax or head next time. 

GG no re lol"
Cringingthrowaway1,"Stop shooting scavs in arms and legs, my dude."
oliot_,This *is* a skill issue
Sarahdumby,why are you using T-46
MikjallOfHargreaves,"You're hitting appendages mostly and you have a bolt action rifle, you either shoot more accurately or get a gun with a better fire rate."
Epicpacemaker,Tbh you’re shooting too low for the consistent 2 tap you’re looking for
Sea-Bodybuilder2746,you have to hit chest twice or head.. so yea. skill issue.
strike_it_soon,leg leg stomach stomach. skill issue unironically.
MandiocaGamer,why don't shoot to the head?
Dyyrin,"Love these clips where people bitch about the game, but they just fumbled and blame the game and not themselves."
ExecutionerKen,Yep skill issue confirmed. Did you even check before you post?
akayd,To be fair you hit arm -> r.leg -> l.leg -> torso/stomach. If you simulate that in battle buddy app you can see how you can survive it without armor.
Repulsive_Voice823,You have straight up enough health to survive that right? Those do only around 75 dmg off the top of my head and you have 440 hp effective health before you die to collateral
Wdhughes89,They have nerfed the mosin into the ground the gun is worthless now. Cant even one tap someone in the chest with no armor on unless it fragments. Bsg answer to everything is to nerf everything into the gtound instead of balancing. I wont touch a mosin anymore unless its for a quest vpo is way better.
DrCthulhuface7,Have you considered playing a game that isn’t shit?
will4111,"If ur shooting a scav and it’s not dying. 4shots I’d shoot another 4… but it’s very possible it’s a desync issue and the scav can kill u but they are invincible to ur bullets. 

Happened at least 3x a wipe to me, got a few clips of it.  Really frustrating when u mag dump a pmc close range and die, I mean dump a mag into their body standing face to face then they kill u."
Iteroparous,Pretty clear skill issue bro ngl
KoreanThighLover,Bro stop aiming at his legs
DahMagpie,Try hitting thorax or head Mr. SkillIssue
The_Throwaway_Stick,"It would help if you shot something other than the limbs. Your title is correct.

Edit: I'll attempt to be constructive. Once your leg is blown out, moving and shooting (especially a bolt action) is not advisable. I would rather stand still and take a moment to aim, at the risk of being shot, than try to move and shoot in that condition."
Key_Transition_6820,"Yea it is, hit em in the head and only have to shoot once"
theyak12,Ur aim is shit
JoopSiroop,Just use T47 next time stupid
Gigachad____,"hit unknown,leg,leg, stomach?/leg?

100% a skill issue. Not a game issue"
XBL_Fede,And people say the mosin is good lmao. They shouldn’t have nerfed its price or its ammo.
BlackSunlight7,Better chair.
not_shodan,"I'm just gonna say, no cover"
gen_adams,"these desyn bugged ass scavs were the last drop in the bucket for me. shit made me quit tarkov last year, for real this time. my last bleed-out death came from a scav like this in dorms. I was with my squad, all of us kept full auto shooting the fucker from point blank (he came up the stairs in full aggro) and refused to die after multiple emptied magazines. killed my friend, then after minutes the scav died but I was bleeding from every orifice. I swore then and there (as it was a really good raid) that I refuse to play this shitty game until they fix it.

&#x200B;

a year later and netcode is still shit, servers are slow and inefficient and desync is rampant."
StudMuffin0219_2,Skill issue
Stonedfiremine,"It is, you aimed for the legs."
assalariado,This game is broken dude. Just get out...
AquaPSN-XBOX,you are AWFUL lmao
Humble_Letter_2266,isnt T46 a pen bullet? aim for the head or use a pistol for leg or thorax shot
hitlory,"seems like mosin ammo got nerfed this wipe, ive shot people with SNB plenty of times before they die"
Velihopea,"I had monents like this earlier in the wipe with mosin, where I'd shoot unarmored scavs 4-5times to upper torso to kill em. I think the the issue is either hitreg issue/mosin not penetrating arms and/or some scavs have extra hp randomly, and mosin seems to terribly match these increased hp tresholds.

Either way, mosin felt absolutely unusable to me. If i couldnt headshot a scav, I knew I was in trouble."
FreeWaves16,"T-46M one tapped me through an Altyn on factory the other day. Unlucky, wcyd"
bigdumgoose,Gotta upgrade that ammo my man
Remarkable_Screen_38,"Dont use t46M, YW"
evoxbeck,"Its okay I love when i blast em in the head 1/3 my clip as they gallop in the bushes

Fuck the sniper scavs."
BitterQuitter11,100 skill related
Professional-Bed-486,Don't use bolt action for close quarters.
SobigX,"Insert a random ""git gud"" comment here."
lordOfTheVoid3,Ah yes then I get one tapped using a class 4 rig with LPS
Noox89,Can’t remember which tarkov shooter part is night sniper kills but it’s usually a breeze not this wipe this was basically exactly what it looked like for me all 8 kills.
OrangeSimply,The only part that's a constant problem with scavs is the lack of any hitstun at all. Like I know hes using a bolt action and it doesnt really matter in this context but that is just a bit much on the bs meter for me a lot of the time.
Anna_Maria338,skill issue.. sorry
Puzzled_Inflation_95,"Is ya 
T45 suk"
PossiblyCuban,"….you also stood still, didn’t try and get behind some cover to keep engaging, and hit extremities. 

You’re asking for the scab to send you to lobby."
Dli22,T-45M are very bad
theppburgular,"Yes it is a skill issue lol. While I agree the health system flawed tarkov bullshit buggy dead game bsg Nikita suck pp blah blah blah. But maybe only 1 of ur shots hit the thorax, that was a legitimate death and ur own fault"
JiffTheJester,You hit different limbs every time. It is a skill issue actually 😂
thefirst1nvad3r,"A common issue in that patch, probably the server isn't registering your hits or simply damage is calculated wrong (T45M deals around 85 dmg, so if your hits are correct scav should have taken 340 dmg)"
BlackPrincessPeach_,"Skill issue, you either tap the head or your dead"
KaranteDeux,OP just noob
pain_apple_,"aim for the head next time, that way you only have to hit three shot."
NiqqersTonquemMyAnvs,this game is so shit at the moment lol
DauBinePeLanga,Aim lab is free on steam
Kindly-Mine-1326,Happens to me all the time. Players catch the bullets with arms and legs. I get nauseous by looking at that clip.
Voro14,"Ow. Sadly it seems you only hit different limbs, allowing it to tank that much.

Probably bled out right after, lol."
LogicsForIdiots,"That one drugged out scav

I'm pretty sure there are 4 different types of Ai scav, each with different health pool"
Tankeverket,Tbf T-46M is quite literally the worst ammunition for the Mosin
Samppa9810,Didn't check comments and was about to post it. Thx for you Service
okarnando,"Should have included the end screen showing shots fired and shots hit. 

I wouldn't be surprised if you missed them all and it just looked like you hit them all on your screen."
HaZarD_SFD,Overpenetration isnt real tho.
Aelitus,How late in the raid was this? People forget they gave a shit ton of HP to scavs late in the raid.
Plane-Day-164,This is why I left the game
DaFishingVest,OP should’ve aimed for the head like a chad
DarkSamuraiSC,"The health system in this game is broken into limbs. The only way to kill someone is to zero their Head or Thorax, so you should be arming for those, especially with a slow bolt-action.

You will eventually kill if you keep hitting arms/legs, but it's very inefficient, especially with this gun. If you want to leg enemies try high rate of fire hollow points, or shotgunning.

Edit: ""I'm"" to ""in"""
BigToasster,Mosins were nerfed awhile back remember? Because streamers shit their pants over being one tapped by a mosin wearing 4 armor. Now all mosin ammo doesn’t one tap unless you have good shit
spamdatm4,"nobody should be using mosin besides for quest, they made it stupidly garbage / weak. the Kedr, the Smg from pk, the sks, even the double barrel shotgun are better. than using the mosin now,"
Own-Mission6966,Yesterday I had an unarmored scav tank 4 ap-20s until he finally died. Was at less than 10 meters so I could clearly see them hit and he obviously almost killed me in 1 hit with magnum buck 😊
SAKilo1,"Because yah know, scavs have 3 sets of health. There’s your basic scav, then one that’s a bit more and one that has the health of a boss."
kidsaredead,this is my daily routine
Folken88,"Lol I scav'd reserve yesterday and found a dead level 40 gigachad fully geared, killed in the bunker by a vepr-hunter scav. He'd killed about 3 others but Nikita just kept sending T-100s back in time to kill this poor kylereese and he finally got got."
preyforkevin,"What I’ve found out playing the last 3 wipes: you can shoot a scav, you can hear a scav getting hit with your shot, you can see blood mist/spatter onto whatever object is behind or next to that scav. All those things happening doesn’t mean you’re hitting the target."
Edenwing,"Never double peek a scav or raider from the same corner, need to reposition to break line of sight between shots or bursts, the AI is not that smart"
GaretRFC,"This happened to me earlier, 3 shots of lps, at least 2 centre mass, walked me down and killed me with a pistol..."
skcuf2,I bet he died after he killed you. I'm sure he was bleeding out of at least one of the spots you shot.
Doobie717,"not disagreeing with the hits, but standing out in the open repeatedly firing....in the open...not a wise choice lol. shoot and scoot!"
Gafsd123,Not all hits are created equal
GamingShorts-,"""realism"""
Zazi_Kenny,What was the damage and hit report screen?
Bonus-Representative,T-46M is less effective than throwing Billiard Balls at a Scav...
TsuZaki969,"Another ""i'm trash at the game but it's not my fault I died"""
Sargash,"I mean, all shots are to the stomach, can't tell with the first shot though. One of them looks like it hits the leg actually. The first shot does look like a leg shot to me though, definitely not a thorax.  
Actually a skill issue."
Unlmtdglass,"The amount of times I have headshot, non helmet wearing scavs and just had them run off like nothing happened is insane. Definitely realism at its finest"
Traditional-King1083,Looks like you should probably aim for the head with a bolt action rifle
piebadger,Turned that scav in to a nugget
ALFA502,Aim to the head when using mosin.. otherwise you are tilling them where you are.
Brohyda,Shoot faster next time.
mrbawkbegawks,"you shot him 4 times in his 2 testicles, its only gonna land twice"
ArgentShige,T-46 is probably the worst ammo you can use on the Mosin from my experience(can’t kill crap) aiming for head or chest would of been ideal aswell. Leg/arm shots with t46 would probably take like 7-8 rounds lol
Tylerswolf69,gotta love it. hey but if it was easy no one would play.
Subsonic17,This game is so bad. Can’t even play a whole wipe because of hackers and shit gun play.
Hairypossum77,Almost got killed by a scav on woods after putting half a mag of 7.62X39 HP in him and he wasn’t wearing any armor
Sharptooth16,Just aim for the head next time. It will only take 3 shots to kill 😂
Sesleri,"82 damage per shot x 4 = 328

?

Yeah limbs are tanky in this game with its health system."
djn808,stop shooting him in the legs holy shit
Mirroredentity,"Always hated how hitting arms and legs is essentially useless in this game unless you're doing some sort of rapid fire leg meta spray. One of many ironic ""realism"" attempts by the devs that's ended up doing the opposite."
Sp3ctre777,"“You have to apply damage to your brain when it comes to our game” -Nakita 

But for real. Why tf are you using that garbage ass ammo when LPS is available lvl 1. Spend the extra 100 rubles a shot and maybe you wouldn’t die like this"
JollyReading8565,How many bullets hit ?
TomeKun,Me when i get a 1M rouble loot on a scab run and die near the extract to a rogue that resisted a M855 Bullet in the skull and 180 head shot me :)
Iper79,They need to make there health consistent
TheUna_Clock3r,"That's so crazy!  The day before yesterday, I was running on woods,  Had a FREASH LV4 ANA Armor rig on and got 1 tap to the chest with that ammo!    I was so freaking pissed!  And yet you can shoot scavs with no armor and they tank it and walk it off!"
Khronus6,Hit him in the face. Better results.
chudds007,"Anyone that calls skill is bullshi and can ligmuh, I have shot a scav 6-7 shots of flechette to the body and face. This game is on CRACK"
gpierson99,Should’ve side climbed
KodaKomp,"I have never understood why a knockdown mechanic has not been implemented into the game like you black out a leg they should at least go into a crouched or fallen state, like if I got shot in the knee with 7.62 im gonna immediately hit the ground and make sure leg is still there lol."
Writhe27,shot placement is king man you are hitting leg leg stomach arms
BrownieBROF,"You got the scav that has almost 800hp if not more, yes, scav health pools are random and that one has almost the same torax health as an boss"
Traditional_Tax8672,Not giving you shit or anything because this game is bad like that sometimes. You should use LPS its like 100 roubles more and its better in every way and doesn't let people know where your at via tracer
ekohzzz,"AHHH
OHHH
AHHH
AHHH!!"
Caleb__,Realistic game play
Malfor_ium,So 7.62 should be nerfed more? Understood!
orbb09,"T-46M is 82 dmg/shot

Scav has 440 or 540 HP

All shots were to non-vital parts (not thorax or head) so you would need to drop their HP to 0 to kill
82x4 = 328, but additional (or reduced) damage can occur depending on which blacked body part is shot (and assuming you didn't do any fragmentations (critical hits)). If you shoot a blacked stomach, you do 1.5x damage. If it's a blacked leg, you do base (1x) damage. Although 4x shots of 7.62x51 to kill somebody sounds ridiculous, the math checks out. No kill."
Suspicious-Cucumber9,Next time try to shoot yo his head
Yung_Branch,Sound confirmation on all hits. Nikita sayeth too bad rip
Sol_Tric,Headshots work too.
BREAKERTHELORD,sacv dont have blood cell its vodka running trough their vein
deanosauruz,Is it worth downloading again?
HeisenbergWHHW,if you hit him in the head maybe he would be dead 🤔
PutridAppointment69,"You’re supposed to aim for the thorax or head, so yeah. Skills issue."
EmmEnnEff,"Have you tried not shooting him in the legs/stomach/balls hitbox?

A PMC can survive all these shots."
ivarretje,skill issue
vgamedude,"As realistic as playable! Veritas told me some super soldier took like 5 7.62x54r shots and kept fighting that's definitely the norm and you can totally take full power rifle rounds to your thorax and be combat effective!

People defending this shit in the comments LMFAO. Go play any other realistic shooter this would never happen."
Maggiespharm,That scav just has a really good gaming chair
Lt-Courier,Uses a garbage round. *Dies
Feikas9,My scavs tank AP-20 12x70 to the face.... so no surprise there.
ComprehensiveRisk983,I saw maybe 1 hit
langile,I raise you [4 (5?) PS shots to lvl 3 armour scav](https://streamable.com/mbu494)
Never-Shower,"i agree, it's a skill issue"
proscreations1993,"Been happening a lot lately.  I shot a scav in the head 3 times from 10 feet on reserve the other night with 762 Bp. Had a meta mutant, cpc, bastion with quad nods. He ate every one and then one tapped me in the face with 7mm buck.  
And I’ve just had AI not dying until after you die.    I was fighting raiders a few raids after. Rd with 50 rounder of bp. Almost same kit. Killed the first two raiders with headshots. The last one ate two headshots and then started running so I mag dumped his chest.   They were the only things I shot at that raid and I had a 16 hit count. He one tapped me in the face while I was holding the right hand peak. Apparently pixel peaks don’t work anymore lol.  My friend said he died a few seconds after I did. Lol nothing registered on that raider till long after I was dead .  And another raid I killed all 3 raiders. Didn’t even get hit. They didn’t even shoot.  When into another room to reload.  Finished reloading and heard a bunch of gunfire all glitching out and I dropped dead.  It said I died to one of the raiders that I killed 10 seconds ago.   The hit reg and desync is beyond busted this wipe."
echostar7,scavs got stealth turned up to crack level again.
Pattyg1,"Funny thing is my buddy was raging yesterday, a scav one tapped his thorax with the same ammo, though level 4 armor too. 😂🤣😭"
qwerplol,I think you shot him in the stomach 3 times.
FinezaYeet,Summary: Shots 1- 2: Clearly missed. Shot 3-4: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shot 5: most likely didn't go through because you were already dead.
LoneCentaur95,"You shot its legs and stomach, unarmored has nothing to do with it."
prodolphinplayer,deserved for abusing mosin
TheBoRiley,Shoot the face not the stomach/ arms/ thorax
waynebruce161989,Stop using a shitty gun. Haha. I'm guessing this is for a bolt action quest. But still ha. There are better ones. Ha sorry random but I'm just like why is he using a musket. Haha
