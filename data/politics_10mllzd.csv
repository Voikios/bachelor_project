ScotTheDuck,"The reason why is incredibly stupid too.  Newsmax has multiple free streaming services, but they went to DirecTV and demanded that they pay a carriage fee.  They aren't being censored, they're just idiots who have no business sense."
Drewy99,">While DirecTV described it as a financial decision, Newsmax accused DirecTV of discrimination and censorship. ""This is a blatant act of political discrimination and censorship against Newsmax,"" Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy said in an article on the Newsmax website titled, ""AT&T's DirecTV Cancels Newsmax in Censorship Move.""

A predictable yet still embarrassing statement.

Everything is a conspiracy against them. Everything."
QuirkyLog9218,"""As a violent mob was breaching the doors of the Capitol [during the January 6 attack], Newsmax's coverage called the scene a 'sort of a romantic idea,'"" the Eshoo/McNerney letter said. It also said that ""Newsmax has amplified allegations that members of the Chinese Communist Party helped to develop the COVID-19 vaccine."""
KennyDROmega,"The ""party of small government"" wants to force a private business to carry a network.  

Wow.  WOW."
Katana1369,I love how they're threatening to investigate a private corporation for following the free market idea that profits are good and losses are bad.
DaveVsShark,"I thought Republicans were down with the free market?

kirlie,"When I had Dish Network, I didn't have ABC for over 9 months because they didn't want to pay a high access fee.  This is something Dish/Direct TV/Other carriers are constantly fighting.  It's less political and more financial than the ""outrage"" deserves."
PopeHonkersXII,"""No! You can't take away our fascist propaganda!"""
Neither-Idea-9286,Republicans used to be pro-business but now they‚Äôre just pro-republican.
BarbequedYeti,"Super easy fix.  Offer it as its own channel and package.  It could be the fascist propaganda tier.  Newsmax, Fox, etc.  Then see who actually pays for it.   Which will be no one.  Then they can kill it all in one swoop."
AlexFromOgish,"Now for Fox News‚Ä¶. These channels get most of the revenue from cable provider subscription fees, rather than from advertising.  Thus, even if you are committed to only watching quality journalism, and you NEVER watch Fox, if you have a cable subscription, you are part of Fox News‚Äô number one source of income.  Collectively, cable TV customers rank among the top funding sources for the poisons that will destroy America, and stockholders who own the cable companies, have the power to change their business model to help America kick its ‚Äúhate addiction‚Äù"

trolleyblue,Republicans really hate the free market.
luckydog1984,"""The most extreme liberal channels, even with tiny ratings, get fees from AT&T's DirecTV, but Newsmax and OAN need to be deplatformed,"" Ruddy said.

Republicans don‚Äôt want to have to pay for other families children to go to public school because socialism,  but they want everyone to pay so a handful of maniacs can watch propaganda all day."
GrumpyAtheist,"> ""This is a blatant act of political discrimination and censorship against Newsmax,"" Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy.

Political belief isn't a protected class and private companies can censor anyone or any thing at any time."

SuperGenius98K,Now do the Scientology channel.
illjustputthisthere,"Newsmax->PAY ME FOR LOW RATINGS.

DirectV-> Haha. No.

Conservatives-> We're being targeted by the leftist deep state who doesnt want us to speak truth.

internetbrowser23,"Cant believe any network carried that toxic waste masquerading as """"news"""". They never should have touched it in the first place, but especially not after trump was spewing his election nonsense"
old-hand-2,Republicans! Unite and create your own uncensorable satellite network to broadcast your shows. Spend your money there instead of backing idiotic candidates like George Santos.
Possibly_a_Firetruck,"Sorry Republicans, the free market has spoken.

> DirecTV said Nielsen data shows that ""Newsmax's average household audience is only 101,000 households [nationwide], representing less than 0.1 percent of total TV households. That is 92 percent lower than Fox News. If Newsmax ceases to authorize our carriage of their channel, our customers will still have access to their clearly preferred conservative news channel, Fox News, which has more viewers than MSNBC, CNN and Newsmax combined."""
OutofStep,"So let me get this right... in this case, Newsmax is a cake and Republicans are the gay couple?"
skobuffaloes,Who are republicans NOT outraged at at this point?
OneArmedBrain,"Newsmax has a program to sell to DirectTV.  DirectTV didn't want to buy it.  It's what we like to refer to as the free market.  Case closed, you stupid, outraged (R)'s.  Crying and moaning about losing a sale is for amateurs.  Trump himself would call them losers."
chockedup,">Newsmax urged viewers ""to contact their members of Congress and senators to oppose *censorship of Newsmax* and demand support for fairness and equity for conservative media.""

That's a ridiculous analogy.  It's not censorship when the price is too high."
Erazerhead-5407,"Any news outlet that glorified the attack on our capital on January 6, 2021 should be removed from public consumption."
MedicalDiscipline500,"So when will we start seeing people destroy their satellite dishes to ""own the libs""?"
Mr-Warmth,"New Zealand doesn't allow Faux News on any channels in their country because it is conservative propaganda and lies, serving no purpose other than to undermine democracy and fuel hate."

SudoTheNym,"Conservatives: We need to Cancel Direct TV because they dropped Newsmax, so now who can we watch to rail against Cancel Culture?"
randomcanyon,Direct TV owned by AT&T shareholders does their business however they want.  The Newsmax and conservatives have no say in it unless they own the most stock.  And they don't. Outrage of the day. everyday all the time everywhere.

ShiveYarbles,I hate subsidizing these fascist propaganda channels with my Hulu live subscription
oshagme,Republicans and outrage. Name a more classic combination.
5141121,"Capitalism strikes again. NewsMax thought they could soak more money (capitalism) from DirecTV. DirecTV told them ""loleatshit"" (also capitalism).

It's just one big capitalism circle, jerk."
SithLordSid,Free market wins. Good riddance.
zapitron,"""Media in the media"" is one of those funny/weird topics where Republicans come out of the woodwork and reveal themselves to be to the left of people like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, but they perversely _still_ want to be called ""conservatives.""

When people complain DirectTV should subsidize Newsmax to make up for the unpopularity of their content with advertisers and viewers (or when they demand the right to send spam on other peoples' computers), I always want to ask them ""Are you a Lenin or Stalin conservative, or more a modern Khrushchev-style conservative?""

Republicans, all you have to do to make yourself look _only half_ as crazy, is to **own it**. Come out as left-wingers. Don't be afraid. (And it's not like everyone doesn't already know! Everyone is _waiting_ for you to man up and admit it.) In the campaign contribution market, you will still _easily_ differentiate yourselves from Democrats. There's only one way to be conservative, but there are billions of ways to be liberal, and _you_ ""R"" liberals _really aren't_ the same as ""D"" liberals. Don't worry, donors can still tell y'all apart. It'll be ok.

_Let_ yourself _openly_ express your rather-obvious-to-everyone-else opinion that you think private property is theft, and speech should be regulated by government. Coming out, purging yourself of the torment of hypocrisy will make you feel _so_ much better. And it'll make room for a conservative party, so that _not_-so-Khrushchevian ""conservatives"" will have somewhere to go. C'mon, Republicans, _be yourself!_"

ZookeepergameOk8231,Can we find a way to drop Fox News off the edge of the flat Earth?
icouldusemorecoffee,"Good, more of this needs to happen.  One of the reasons Fox News is so popular is because cable outlets carried them as a featured news program on low-cost/low-tier cable subscriptions, so *everyone* that had a basic cable package got CNN and Fox News and while both have had their faults since their inception, only one has, since it's beginning, actively undermined society and democracy in general."
After-Diaspar,"Ah, the market speaks. Isn‚Äôt that a tenet of the right?"
Decent_Cartoonist,I know newsmax from it‚Äôs years as a go to fark laughing stock news source.  It absolutely boggles my mind that theyre a news network and on top of that they expect money to get carried.   Their website used to be chock full of boner pill ads.
Tamirel963,The free market spoke. The product was not viable.

f0gax,Now the GOP hates the free market?
transcendanttermite,"So newsmax is essentially demanding that directv pay them for their channel, despite still not having the viewer numbers to justify any fee at all. And when directv said no, newsmax literally cried to the republican congress members to *‚Äùmake them pay us!‚Äù* 

Perhaps they should pull themselves up by their bootstraps and add enough viewers to justify the fees they‚Äôre trying to charge. That seems like the truly ‚Äúcapitalist‚Äù way to do things."

uniquepanoply,"I used to work for DISH network. While any channel takedown made me take a lot of flak and vitriol from people upset their favorite channel was taken down, any time it was a conservative news channel it was so much worse. They swore it was a liberal conspiracy to shut down conservative reporting or ""the truth"" and that we were complacent in censorship.

In reality, it's pretty much always that they're viewership doesn't warrant the price they're demanding... Nothing more.

I used to get sick as hell every morning before I'd start taking calls. I work at a prison now and have nowhere near the stress working with literal murderers and criminals every day."
