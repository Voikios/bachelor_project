houghi,"I have mine set to 1 hour. That way when I see it, I know it is time to hydrate and stretch. With 2.5 minutes it is a good moment to do just that."
Frostygale,This movie was easily a 9/10 or 10/10 IMO.
SystemRed09,Late game autosave is great. It gives you time to get more coffee to fuel our addiction to this game.
Ehynkdakk,Guys. I'm very curious now. I don't relate to this at all. My PC is old and my autosave is set to 10 minutes. It just glitches for a second and that's all. Maybe I don't have a lot going on?
Beginning-Rain5900,Im just happy to see P&B 2 is getting the recognition it deserves
Tenuousmars7147,My server auto save time of 20 seconds… almost always get killed by it too
TakeshiKovacs46,"Thank the lord for M.2 drives. I’m at 300 hours on this latest build, and it takes a smidge over 5 seconds to save each time. Brammer."
IceOnEuropa,I've found that limiting my total number of concurrent saves to \~3 really helps keep the lag down. I'll save then delete the other save files at the end of each play session and it works into late game.
ClemClemTheClemening,"Does it take you guys a while to save or something?.  Mines set to every 5 mins, and it takes like 3 seconds to save on a 200+ hour world"
cooperia,I thought maybe they had fixed this because I started a new world... Maybe it's just not old enough yet.
BT9154,Time to jet pack up for some massive air
Mastermaze,The best is when youre actively using the jetpack when it saves and you go ZOOOOOMM
KLTechNerd,My Pc is the wolf. When the game auto saves a barely notice a frame rate drop. But I hear my fans kick in for a second. My PC is the wolf.
GeneralKonobi,I solve this by hosting my own dedicated server on a different machine and there's barely a hiccup on auto save
UnluckyGamer49,"There's this one glitch that I love when you get autosaved and boost up with the jetpack, you go flying lol."
Terrible__Pickle,Please fix.
kaghy2,"I really need to get that whistle extracted, loved it. Even gave me chills."
DatAsspiration,Then it autosaves while you're firing your jetpack and the physical impulse after the lag settles sends you sky high
Mizar97,"My save is up to 450 hours, and there's like a 1% chance my game will just crash when it tries to autosave. I've learned it helps to stand still and do nothing when it saves to lessen the chance. The saves still only take 1 second thankfully, NVME M.2 SSD as a boot drive makes a huge difference."
GenericJimmyDeansFan,usually what breaks my PC is the existence of my factory
Collistoralo,"Me, getting into a hyper cannon just before the auto save kicks in, being shot into high orbit and dying immediately"
Theflash91,I just use the lag to get a free boost of jet fuel and shoot me into the sky when I have a jetpack on
Ahajha1177,"My PC is fast but unstable as hell (not overclocked, just unstable). I frequently have to use the autosaves, I'd say on average I have a crash or full system freeze every few hours. I've tried reinstalling windows, nothing seems to work :/"
X_RAY_CAT46,I have a Nvme with a write speed of 6300MB/s so my saves are not that bad so far.
RoyalDrake,u/savevideo u/savevideobot
PxlHD,"i have like 6 or 7 secs when it autosaves even tho i dont understand why, my pc ist not bad or so and autosave is on every 15mins i think? world is only 100 hours old, maybe cause i play with some friends always and that way its online or so?

or is it because of like inventory mods that we use cause its just more chilling"
Byizo,Just turn off autosave to play in hardcore mode.
Lemme_eat_your_pvssy,"I turned mine off, now save manually every hour or 2 when I'm doing something risky (ie building plutonium waste storage at the bottom of an abyss 1m above a death edge of the map, trying out new hyperloops, etc), otherwise only at noon and midnight."
Minute-Food-5565,"im almost at 2 mins save time and almost 5 mins of load time, i have my autosaves set every 15 mins, i hate it more to do things over than to wait 8 mins every hour."
