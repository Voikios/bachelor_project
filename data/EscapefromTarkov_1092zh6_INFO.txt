{"Title": "BSG just removed several armors/helmets from Ragman", "Post Text": "So far it's Rys, Vulkan, and Altyn. They also deleted the Gzhel rouble buy. Korund still exists on Prapor but that likely is gone pretty soon at the rate things are going. Basically everyone is going to be at some point running around in nothing but diaper rags and dick helms the way the game is going.\n\nBTW, the deleting of Rys-T off of Ragman literally makes no sense. You had to be 42 to do it, and it's an expensive trade in, AND you **literally cannot find it anywhere in raid**.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ttvsmittystone/status/1613109085263790081?s=46&t=GvceCvHAPWsYQORAHh\\_jRQ](https://twitter.com/ttvsmittystone/status/1613109085263790081?s=46&t=GvceCvHAPWsYQORAHh_jRQ)\n\nSmittystone for proof.", "ID": "1092zh6", "Score": 1526, "Total Comments": 1629, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1092zh6/bsg_just_removed_several_armorshelmets_from_ragman/"}
