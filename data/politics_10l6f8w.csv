HellaTroi,Anybody ask Dick Cheney?
rva_monsta,Reverse National Treasure plot: they all have docs and have to team up to get them back to the Archives.
purephase,"The Carter comments are funny, since he predates the presidential records act, and it's likely that any documents he might have would be automatically declassified by this point anyway.

I feel like they included him just to be nice."
surfingNerd,What about Cheney?
drdactyl,"Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and 330 million other Americans were marked safe from possession of classified documents."
Professional_360,Now ask Cheney!!
Tree_Droppings,"Tbh, people who have been elected to positions with top security clearance possessing top secret documents/data is not as disturbing to me as just how lax the White House/federal government is with our top secret documents/data. How many top secret documents/data are in the possession of unfriendly hands?"
-The-Baba-Jaga-,I feel like they're asking to get searched.
writingt,Hilarious photo right under the headline
wpmason,Can we do Mitch next?
BobTheViking2018,Is that your final answer?
,I bet they do say that.  So did Pence.
do_add_unicorn,I guess their toilets don't clog.
CodeMonkeyPhoto,"Yeap and still the false equivalence being made. The difference is Trump denied having them, when he did. He moved them a couple of times. It‚Äôs known that foreign entities may have had access to these documents, and some disappeared. Then the raid happened, Trump claims it‚Äôs planted. Then ask for them back. Also obstruction at every step. Also these docs that Trump had contained some of the highest intelligence levels of information, not someone‚Äôs daily schedule that got marked confidential."
OnlyLemonSoap,"Still surprised, that Trump took work home."
magheet,At this point I might need to check my own house.
ExaltedRuction,Dick Cheney when asked cocked his shotgun
StinkyElevator,Meanwhile Carter is sitting on those Area 51 docs.
gearstars,"next week's article:

>Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama ~~say they~~ have ~~no~~ classified documents"
TintedApostle,My take with Obama is he has none at all.  He has been subject to scrutiny since before he was even elected.  He knows that one slip up and the right wing would go after him.  I suspect he made sure everything was clean for himself before he left office.
skulloctopus2023,"Check them anyway.  Just by seeing that Trump, Pence, and Biden all had classified documents in their homes and offices outside of SCIF's, means that every cabinet member of every former president needs to have their homes, offices, etc all searched for classified documents.  Carter too!"
Hyperion1144,What does Carter say???
asabovesovirtual,"what of Cheney? I mean, he was more a president than Bush?"
Fweefwee7,"If I had to guess

Obama would never keep them

Clinton would give them up if he had them

W wouldn‚Äôt be trusted with anything that‚Äôs not a bop-it"
thevaultguy,Why would W steal something he could just get at his dad‚Äôs house?
Fine-Funny6956,"Donald Trump also says he has no classified documents because he declassified them through the act of imagining they were declassified, and also they‚Äôre his so give them back."
boythinks,"I don't live in the US and I haven't ever touched or seen a US government document marked ""confidential"".

But at this point, I might go check if I have some in my basement."
AlanShore60607,"If this is true, it‚Äôs only because they‚Äôve spent over a decade making sure they don‚Äôt have them."
captain_chocolate,That's what they all say!
Various-Bite3521,They all say no until they find them in a garage.
Xerazal,"Next week:

> Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama found to have classified documents in homes after FBI search."
Mean_Seesaw232,"People keep talking about the differences in now Biden and Trump handled the missing documents situation. Clearly Biden handled it better but personally I couldn't give less of a fuck. Both had classified documents, I don't really care how they handled the situation afterward. That's extremely terrifying that our government secrets are so unprotected."
thatnameagain,Dan Quayle though is sweating!
ointmant555,They do.
Smitty_jp,Jimmy Carter is taking his classified documents to the grave.
DonnyMox,It wouldn't surprise me if Cheney took some stuff behind Bush's back.
Banjoplaya420,I bet pretty much all presidents have shit in their houses.
Upstairs_Dealer3055,Has anyone checked if former president George Santos has any leftover classified docs from his administration?
pauljoemccoy,"Barack is definitely the type to know the exact contents of his briefcase at all times and always put classified materials EXACTLY where they‚Äôre supposed to go before he leaves work every day. 

Anything important that Bill took home, on accident on purpose, definitely has been shredded by now.

But George‚Äôs wife probably still finds crumpled up top secret documents in his suit pockets occasionally that he never even knew he had in the first place."
Rambos_Beard,That f---ing picture of the three amigos. Classic!
badamache,Looking at you Jimmy Carter
piperonyl,"What about dick cheney though?

He was, in effect, President."
ZoharTheWise,"And Carter remains silent? He must be the mastermind behind all of this!

/s because sarcasm doesn‚Äôt translate well these days"
TuesdayNightMassacre,They chose the best possible picture for this story üòÇ
ylangbango123,Why is there no process to track classified docs like a library to books borrowed?
mister_wps,20 bucks says that's doubtful. 20 more says most of our Congress has some too.
DubNationAssemble,Lol they‚Äôve not yet had a visit from the classified documents fairy
230flathead,Please tell me they attached that picture with the announcement.
comet94,"At this point I think we probably should check our own houses for classified documents, just to be sure."
realitycheckmate13,Love that photo for this headline
CubbieCubCubCub,Gore has some... in his lockbox.
Stunnagirl,Not like Bush could read them anyway.
MrMrOnTime,Did anyone have the balls to ask Dick Chaney?
digitaldumpsterfire,All that I've really seen lately is that the Archives suck at keeping track of documents.
48lawsofpowersupplys, We‚Äôve investigated our self‚Äôs and we‚Äôre in the clear!
adtr4lyfe93,"I mean, search their residences and businesses anyway, honestly."
Majere,"Next week, Richard Nixon - We have no classified tapes."
Popcorn_Blitz,So is that why Carter built all those houses? I notice he hasn't chimed in here.
Satanifer,I bet Reagan has some hidden somewhere in an old jar of jelly beans.
snorkiebarbados,George can't even read. Why would he have them?
JustVern,"I have little doubt that all of them have some 'classified' docs that are stowed away collecting dust. 

Not for nefarious reasons...just a 'Oh, shit...I took that home?'"
pirateninjamonkey,Same thing Biden said though....
TheRealBroHam,That's exactly what someone with classified documents would say
Possible-Smile2034,"‚ÄúHoney, George, why were you out by the bbq this morning? I saw an awful lot of smoke.‚Äù"
Valuable-Baked,So now we know why Jimmy Carter has been building houses all these years - to store all his classified docs
UniversityOwn8916,They only have blood in their hands .
AngusScrimm---------,"I say it's long past time to raid the home of 98 year old Jimmy Carter, all because Trump saw monetary value in highly classified material."
perpetual_or,"Lol they probably did at some point recently but not no more üòÇ

This whole issue is just funny. This really says less about corruption (not saying that‚Äôs not what is at play) but more about how little oversight we really have for our highest executives in office. 

What needs to happen is better oversight of how classified documents are accessed so we can keep better track of who saw them. At this point I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs even necessary to print something unless it‚Äôs so classified it needs to be typed on a typewriter or handwritten and in that case I can‚Äôt see how that document wasn‚Äôt destroyed after reading. Our government is so ridiculously dumb and it‚Äôs depressing."
mojomonkeyfish,"They're former presidents.  I actually really doubt that they didn't *take* classified documents when leaving office, but I'm under the impression most of them give all that stuff to their ""presidential library"", and the curators then identify and return or get declassified any classified documents.

Vice presidents don't generally have libraries, and so nobody is going through their shit after they leave office.  I would imagine Quayle, Gore, and Cheney all have some random mundane ""classified"" papers among random shit in a box somewhere."
Isotope_Soap,"Such an oddity knowing that former live Presidents, both Republican and Democrat, will get together with some semblance of camaraderie. That will never happen again so long as the orange muppet is alive."
rossbennett96,"Bush most certainly does lol, dude fabricated evidence to start a war that killed millions of innocents, he‚Äôs the worst of the bunch"
dmanjrxx,Apparently that's what they all say and think... until
TermFearless,"Nearly anyone who has regularly either created or  had custody of classified documents, is certainly likely to have a misplaced or buried box of outdated secrets.  The question, is not only does the process have to be improved, but is intent going to be a part of the law on this not?"
black_flag_4ever,No one asked them to say this. Self-own coming up.
ObjectiveSubjects,"Well we‚Äôll fuckin see about that, now won‚Äôt we"
junction182736,That is apparently what people who have classified documents say.
AskJayce,"Not that they know of...

It's entirely possible that their staff made some oopsies that even they themselves don't realize, hence the whole issue with Biden in the first place 

(I'm not including Trump or even Pence because it is far more likely that the documents in their residences were consciously stolen than not and, AFAIK, still refuse to go through proper channel)"
monkeyhind,At this point they should get their lawyers to search anyway.
danimagoo,"Tomorrow's headline: Classified documents discovered at homes of former Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton."
Necessary_Row_4889,"Just don‚Äôt check Clintons search history, you can‚Äôt unsee some stuff"
Scoiatael,"Next week: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama found to have classified documents at their residence."
JedLeonard1,Bill used all his to roll spliffs!
SigmaGamahucheur,Hillary pleads the Fifth.
JulesHaggard,"From a substack article:at https://sethabramson.substack.com/p/update-two-days-after-proof-framed

> Proof presaged today‚Äôs major breaking news: that draconian federal regulations regarding NARA and vice presidents all but ensure outgoing vice presidents will accidentally retain sensitive documents.

. . .

> NARA, per its regulations, offers round-the-clock expert consulting and even round-the-clock manual labor to assist outgoing American presidents with handling and (as appropriate) retaining or surrendering sensitive and classified documents, while vice presidents are offered no assistance at all. This ensures that vice presidents will accidentally end up with documents they should not, even as it gives former presidents the best opportunity imaginable to get things right.

> That Donald Trump did not, nevertheless, get things right‚Äîindeed, he shunned all aid from NARA‚Äîonly further inculpates him, as do all the facts surrounding his case that indicate he stole a large number of documents, over a long period of time, via a course of conduct he personally oversaw, and under circumstances in which he was carefully curating what he took from the White House. That he rejected free NARA aid on top of all this underscores that he didn‚Äôt want his deliberate misconduct to be ascertained."
AbbreviationsOwn223,The three former First Ladies declined to comment on the matter‚Ä¶
cxtx3,Honestly at this point I wouldn't be surprised if people started finding confidential government documents being distributed in McDonalds Happy Meals.
Teddyk123,Fucking PROVE IT.
TeutonicTwit,Better check Monica's house too.
stares_at_rain,"This is a pretty elite way to throw shade.

What I'm trying to say is: I, too, have no classified documents."
Putin_is_a_Dicktator,Until they do...
TheOriginalChode,Bush burned all of his...
Fa1c0n3,Que two weeks from now and all of them are turning in classified documents
undeadermonkey,Not even the cool ones about the aliens?
Loose_Instruction_90,Wild times
MrEpicMustache,But what about Obama's birth certificate? /s
ripyourlungsdave,"Thanks, fellas."
