I_was_a_sexy_cow,Imagine seeing that in a foggy dark weather under a street lamp kinda far away moving towards you
centagon,"Lmao first the flying cheaters, then the sliding levitation cheaters and now the alien anomaly cheats. Can't wait till this becomes ubiquitous"
Back-Proud,Clearly just flasbanged an epileptic kid
PuzzleheadedAd9268,This i what the cultist are summoning
Shooter503,This is probably the one time I see a person flying and can't decide if he's cheating or just bugged the fuck out and possibly having a seizure.
Waveemoji69,"It‚Äôs a dolphin diving hack, it enables you to move quickly and unpredictably and it looks dumb as fuck"
Barticuss90,Cant touch this.
SlavDawg,Bro is fighting Tarkov demons
_sealy_,"People are idiots. That‚Äôs what you call a bored cheater, he‚Äôs just trolling you.

I‚Äôm surprised someone didn‚Äôt claim, it‚Äôs the invisibility bug.

Shadowkrieger7,"Who the fuck thinks this is a bug? no wonder i get downvoted if I say there is hacker that is obvious. There are hackers everywhere in this game, just not this obvious."

Glumas,It's a ninja !
CeoOfLighthouse,Lmao! That guy is clowning so hard. You'd think it would be easy to detect.
truupR,Hack. There was that huge like desycn hack 2 wiped ago where it's like no bullets register on the hacker but it looks like desync. Guys on here were like oh bad desync but on the cheating forums they were all just laughing their asses off at us.
TheNamesBoop,Cheating 100% seen someone do it before
i4play,"Desync or RGB. Surely not codeabusing hacks, surely"
PoperzenPuler,"And BSG is not able to detect this automatically... yep...

The cherry on top... You can only report these players if you get killed by them in the game. However, it's unlikely that a report will make a difference as I believe the reporting function is just for show. Unless, of course, you're a streamer."
Mr_Kills_Alot,Gotta be cheats if he stabbed you

catgirlmasterrace,"the game is done... This is the lowest point, cheating has gone unaddressed for years, and they've ruined the game now.

I don't see anything funky, at all."
bobbyhilljkl,Sumple. Better gaming chair. Man is a God among men.

Square_Software1347,scariest thing I've seen yet

Infamous-Mix7457,"Imagine a 100$ plus game not being able to detect that kind of shit, player moving far past base player speed (should instantly be banned), it baffles me that they do nothing for it. But truth be told cheaters are probably 75% of BSG's income, thus why they do nothing."

MagicMaleMan,Lol that is awesome
Jo0Lz,"Holy shit. This game is so good, and so trash at the same time. I stopped playing two-three wipes ago; when they could just take stuff from your inventory; someone explained that there are csv files stored locally and are synced with the server, people figured out how to intercept and change the files making them able to take gear, etc. 
It also means that the person with faster pc and/or internet almost always wins fights, so skill doesn‚Äôt matter.

I got baited back into the game by the drops and streets map, but even with addition of VoIP and streets, I have to say this game is such a mess, yet it‚Äôs so one of a kind, and I‚Äôm addicted again. :,("
