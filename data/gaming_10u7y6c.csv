SeaJay_31,"*""Now you're ready to sail for the Horn...""*"
Flargblaster8,I think a testament to a good game is that you would rather spend time travelling over teleporting. The Spiderman and Batman games are good examples of this too.

DaftGorilla,"Not gonna lie when Black Flag came out I was not into it at all. Was bored of assassins creed games and pirate movies and this felt like ubi trying to capture that audience since it was the rage at the time.

Skip like 6 years later and I was craving a sailing combat game and the only one really was black flag. ITS SO GOOD WTF! It really is just an all around good game. The music the locals and characters. *Chefs kiss*"
4K40FPS,Water physics against your ship in valhalla was much worse compared to odyssey & black flag. Like the ship didnt have wieght

madtony7,It is tiiiiiime to go nooooow...
Hot_Sea_1687,"I dont understand why didnt they make a spinoff series????

Copy and past black flag - add a more rough Pirates of the Caribbian artstyle, a solid story, add more trading/looting mechanics, ship interours and remove the white hoods/hidden blade/parkour. Bang you got yourself a new cashcow, thats Sea of Theives but better.
 
(I know about the Skull & Bones project and its a mess)"
kalez238,"I fast traveled all the time in ACBF, but only because I would get side tracked by every ship I saw until I ended up on the wrong side of the map, and then fast traveled back only to do it again. Plenty of time for the shanties in that."
mech_man_86,All we wanted was another Black Flag and they couldn't even manage that.
kizmitraindeer,I should replay this game‚Ä¶
krukson,Same with AC Valhalla during river exploration. Those old norse songs are gold.
_Killj0y_,"Safe and sound at home again, let the waters roar, Jack.

Hey, ho, blow winds blow!"
Help_im_okay,Fr i love to listen to sea shanties when I drive so I can feel like a pirate
JadesterZ,"This game was great given that it had no right to be. AC3 was a disaster after Ubisoft fired the creator/writer of the franchise. The real world story I was invested in got shat all over and then ignored. Then I went to see where I lived at the time (the keys) and it was a series of mountainous islands??? Then Dry Tortugas, which I've been to many times, is a huge pillar sticking out of the ocean? It's literally a sandbar  lol"
joftheinternet,"How close is game to Sid Meyer's Pirates?

I loved that game"
Bowbag_,And obviously you gotta put black sails on
lordpookus,"I played alot of ac4 when my fiance was pregnant. She'd go to bed early and tell me all she could hear where shanties and then ""FIRE!"" over and over again because I'd get into a ruckus with another ship."

fortysecondave,"Play Sea of Thieves, shanties any time."
BarryTGash,Combat felt janky but loved me some sailing 'n singing!
Agant,Only game that made fast travel feel not that important to me.
whyreadthis2035,Sounds like your using the whole game. Well done!
Susanoo_1337,AC Black Flag and Rogue still the best two AC games to this day and you can't tell me otherwise.
The_Odradek_Champion,‚ÄúLowlands Away‚Äù is the GOAT
tjlightbulb,Games this good I try not to fast travel at all. It‚Äôs worth just enjoying the atmosphere.

I still remember this one even a decade later"
firesquasher,Leave her Danny Leaaavvveee her
TattooedB1k3r,"Lol, I thought I was the only one who did this...
My GF would be watching me play and be like ""why don't you just fast travel?"" And I'd just respond, ""It's the journey that makes it worth it""...lol"
godieweird,Sitting around drinking grog and singing shanties sounds like a great time to me
SweetSeaMen_,How is this game? Is it really a Assassins creed game but you do pirate shit ? Like your whole game can be you being a menace and taking over ships around a large map?
ftbc,One of my Sea of Thieves buddies is an opera singer. He knows a few dozen shanties now and it's glorious sailing with him.
BussyIsMyFavorite,What will you do with a drunken sailor?
Cyborg_666,This game was a masterpiece.

lol_camis,"That's among the best games I've played in the last 10 years. I know people shit on Ubisoft, and it's true, they're just releasing the same 2 games in a different setting every couple years, but the core of those games is great."
Outcastmike,Best AC game
KrispRune,Wait... You could fast travel?
Available_Major_8281,I fucking played this game for like 100 hours before I realized I could fast travel. I am not smart.
DJ_Spark_Shot,This is my biggest gripe with Valhalla. You don't spend enough time on the longboat to even finish a single song or story.
niko217,the only game i bothered to 100%. twice.
WalkerBRiley,"Ooooh, we've got this notion

That we'd quite like to sail the ocean

So we're building a big boat to leave here for good.

We're not keen on sinking

So we're all sitting here a thinking

'Cause we built it too big and we've run out of wood.

eidle eidle eee

eidle eidle eee

We simply can't leave 'til we get some more wood.

Oooh, we're not keen on sinking

so that's why we're sitting thinking

cause we simply can't leave 'til we get some more wood."
mahdi015,The game was really fun to play
mikeumm,One of the few truely worthwhile collection activities in video games
eiko_chan4,THERE IS FAST TRAVEL IN AC4??
Larfze,"It had a fast travel option!!???!!

This was the only game where I never looked for any such options."
OurFriendIrony,Whooooooooooooooo lives in a pineapple under the seaaaaaa?
PhelixFanel,"I would skip through until Johnny leave her or Roll and go played, the rest are kinda grating."
CouldYouNot11,Thats why I love Valhalla too c:
Arandomguyoninternet,"ƒ∞ mean you could listen to them while doing the collectibles. Honestly the worst part of collecting everything was the fact that the shanties stopped when you left the ship .


Aside from that this was one of the games where collecting pointless stuff wqs actually fun for me, since you had to sail around to collect them"
RuinLoes,There was fast travel?
KayC720,I‚Äôm definitely in the minority but I remember hating boat travel when I played this game. I just wanted to do assassin shit
Frag2k4,"Wait, this game had fast travel?"
curiosify,"they were the worst part of the game, always turned them off"
PassablePhony,There's fast travel?
77SevenSeven77,I remember when I lost all sea shanty audio for a while‚Ä¶ it took me ages to remember I‚Äôd turned down the music audio slider at some point and it hadn‚Äôt occurred to me at the time that the sea shanties were classed as music in the game.
Sly_hatchet,non audio post >: |
bardown5hole,Play Sea of Thieves and play all the shanties you want (on multiple instruments) while sailing the seas. Such an amazing game!
S20-Urza,"AC4 wasnt a good AC game by all accounts

But damn was it fun being a pirate."
Frkn385,Me never playing this game again since I want an actual Assasins creed game and not some pirate story where you need to fight more on a fucking ship than on land (I want to play a stealth game)
,[deleted]
Player694202811,POV: u got a new one
Tim_Allosaurus,This and Red Dead Redemption 2 are the only games that I actually do not fast travel in.
xX_kajak_Xx,Peak AC gameplay
Dudeinpajamas,"Back when I played this game I went through a 26oz of Jim Beam a night, ALL ABOARD!"
Elda-Taluta,Fast travel had never been so pointless before that game.

fourleggedostrich,"I never fast travel in any game.

Too scared of missing a random side quest or treasure."
ianf115,you can fast travel?
Sill3ntK1ller,"I fast travvled because im way to agresseive and would always attack every ship on sight, even if i didnt need the loot,  so it would take me 30-40mins to get where i needed to go"
fond-of-hats,This is the way
Jasonmancer,What would you do with the drunken sailor~~~
Ricktatorship91,"Such a fun game, having to do the main missions was annoying. I wanted to be only pirate, not assassin."
Brickhouse94,Sean dagher is amazing
Madraj,"I love this game so much, one of my favorite game ever and the best assassin's creed just in front of odyssey"
Masikinias,I have never fast traveled in this game
AnukkinEarthwalker,"Been a long time since I played black flag last. 360 I think.

Cant remember it all. Remember the singing but isn't that like the only difference between black flag and sailing in odyssey..? Which I picked back up lately after abandoning a year or 2 ago..

Edit: nm. Battles were way more intense with legendary ships to war with..also no cannons in odyssey cause of..history..I suppose.  

Ah probably going to have to install black flag now since i haven't played in so long."
Immediate_Pain_8268,"üéµThere once was a ship that put to sea  
The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea  
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down  
Oh blow, my bully boys, blow

Soon may the Wellerman come  
To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
One day, when the tonguing is done  
We'll take our leave and goüéµ"
Dovahnime,The ambience of just sailing along to the shanties was pure magic. Even when I streamed it not long ago there are stretches of time when I just let it play to the sound of them
