{"Title": "Breaching is part of the game. get over it", "Post Text": "I'm shocked honestly. I've never seen so much complaining about a core mechanic in my life. An entire thread dedicated to people complaining that disabling a ship doesn't kill the players and they can still breach you. All the cries of \"git gud\" from people who don't realize the irony of that statement when they're complaining about having to gunfight. \n\nIf you don't like getting breached by a crew you just attacked, don't go picking fights. If you want to go around starting fires, you better be prepared for the smoke. Breaching is THE core mechanic of this game that sets it apart from everything else, and it isn't going away, nor is it getting nerfed. \n\nMy suggestion: get better at gunfights or focus on the poi. If you disable someone's ship, you should already be expecting them to breach you and bring you all their gear. If it still bothers you, go play EVE or something where there's only space combat. Space is a dangerous place, stop trying to nerf it.", "ID": "10a4s5a", "Score": 42, "Total Comments": 250, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/10a4s5a/breaching_is_part_of_the_game_get_over_it/"}
