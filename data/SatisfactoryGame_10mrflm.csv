lurkylurkylurky12345,"Given how much I use ctrl-z when playing Factorio, I’m baffled that it’s not yet in Satisfactory"
houghi,What it needs is two step placement of blue prints.
quantumdude836,"Best I've come up with is to just save right before placing, then reload if it places wrong. Bit tedious, but better than having to disassemble a failed placement"
stephenBB81,"I don't need an undo button as much as I need a better way to delete stuff. 

I wish I could Zoop  XYZ directions and delete everything in a cube."
SilentStrikerTH,Or a blueprint deconstructor mode.
Due-Consequence9579,I want to be able to zoop blueprints to maximize my regret.
Icaros_Crowe,"Sometimes it would be nice to toggle snapping and have a fine tuned placement control option, where you move the object directly instead of against the surface are looking at."
EidolonRook,Facts.
What-Nightmar3,"I'm honestly surprised that it doesn't give you a few minutes to delete all of the creation when using blueprints. Something like a prompt that says ""Remove item only"" and ""Remove Blueprint"""
Slamb73,I just learned you can mass delete stuff by holding control. It's a bit clunky but made deleting blueprint stuff a lot easier.
Bubbaganewsh,What would be really cool is if you could make blueprints from material you have no matter where it is. Astro Colony lets you build from inventory if you dont have it on you.
weneedthegbs,Could not agree more. Simple undo when placing blueprints. Also adding the ability to mass delete in a specific highlighted box would be great.
sephtis,"It's probably planned, but with how recent blueprinting is (It still crashes me every now and then), probably a ways away.  
FYI one crash is using blueprints to make blueprints."
clemtiger2011,"I'd just be happy if blueprints could snap properly.
The fact my blueprint for 4x4 foundation can't snap to a line of 4 identical foundations and I have to be accurate to the millimeter is driving me crazy"
TheisNamaar,Save and reload
Frutol,"No undo button

With great power

Comes great responsability"
Surprise_Corgi,"Oh no, it clips terribly.

Oh no, how could I have possibly not foreseen the issue with trying to place rectangle and square-shaped, right-angled blueprints in a very three-dimensional world, with hills and slopes."
jtr99,"As someone who just got re-addicted with update 7, I'm so glad to hear it's not just me that feels like this!"
riddlemore,tbh with blueprints I decided to use the save editor on satisfactory calc to undo them. It’s tedious but still faster than doing it in-game.
BT9154,"I've yet to try blue print but when he said in the demo that you have to manually delete each piece I knew I'd screw up some many times.

Speaking of deleting they really need like a filter mass delete, too many times when I'm redoing a factory and I need to mass delete and just kinda move my mouse over everything I wish I can filter out selecting floors because if you delete the floor it's just hard to delete now floating objects."
Slamb73,I just want an undo button when I'm placing mergers and splitters. In 120 hours of gameplay I still somehow misalign them.
Brick_Rage12,It's gotten to the point that destructability is one of the design criteria in my blueprints..
Clark3DPR,When i accidentally mass delete part of my factory
Delroy1989,"I'm  surprised noone has mentioned it to the devs, the game definitely needs a undo feature"
Thranx,Haven't placed a blueprint yet... I'm on break until release... SO looking forward to the ease of bulk building...and the terror of the mis-click.
DonLordUltra,"I placed 3 blueprints yesterday, all wrong. Now I have a small break from the game, before I find motivation to undo that mess."
s1mmel,So true!
Ritushido,And better snapping...if I could freeze it in place before confirming and be able to make small adjustments to it on the X and y axis I would be so happy.
mgiuca,"My suggestion for blueprint UI: when you place it, it creates a single object (like a grouped object in Photoshop or something). It remembers that it came from a blueprint, allowing you to delete the whole thing at any time (not just immediately after). Or do other things like middle-click to copy the blueprint, not just one object.

Then there's a new keybind to permanently ""ungroup"" a blueprint object, splitting it into it's individual components so you can edit them individually."
Sharkophage,Another good option would be to have a blueprint dismantle mod
aureanator,"Assign a unique id to every buildable in the blueprint as it is placed, implemented as an object property on each buildable. 

When deleting in blueprint mode, search the blueprint volume around the target buildable for buildables with the same object property, and highlight for deletion in the same way as multi-select.

Edit: each blueprint placed increments a global counter tracking 'blueprint serial number'. The serial number can be the blueprint id - the property value."
Pangamma,I just assumed it would have one. I'm surprised that it doesn't. I just unlocked it yesterday and I haven't had a chance to try it out yet. Sure hope they had an undo button.
Zaziizu,"Had that happen few times to me.  Placed 4x4x3 blueprints with dozens of parts off by like half a tile. Can't even use the mass-remove when standing in the middle of the factory. Destroyed other infrastructure by accident a few times.

  
Blueprints also need to be saved in cloud.

Had to reset my PC today. I knew satisfactory was saving in the cloud, so didn't think twice about wiping it.

Reset PC, reinstalled Satisfactory and saw my saves - so far so good.  
Spent like 2 hours setting up a new train station for a new resource. Then back in base started building the production, opened Quick-search (N), started typing my blueprint-name => no results. Opened building-menu, switched to blueprints => the (sub-)categories are there, but not a single blueprint. Not sure if it's a bug or incomplete feature.

'F' for the over 20 hours standing in front of the blueprint designer tinkering modular and reusable blueprints.  
Closed the game the next minute.

Hope I don't forget too many hotkeys 'till next content patch."
SpentChange,I love this meme. I also miss Key and Peele.
ToVarisH_Mc_SlaV1aN,game needs optimisation( after update 6 my pc no longer can handle satisfactory
