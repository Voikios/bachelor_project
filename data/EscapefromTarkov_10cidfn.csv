malapropter,"Oh, I can answer this outright: no, your account isn’t safe. 

I had my account falsely banned at the beginning of 12.12 along with a few hundred other players because we all had the same MoBo. The response from BSG: “we can ban your account for any reason at any time without telling you why. Get fucked, cyka.” I’m paraphrasing slightly, but the general thrust is there. The language in the EULA is quite clear.

“ To restrict or terminate the User’s access to the Game on the conditions hereof, including if the User violates the terms of this Agreement or the Key Documents. In exercising this right, Battlestate Games Limited is not required to provide the User with evidence of the breach by the User of the terms of the Agreement resulting in the User’s access being terminated or restricted.“

Ironically, considering the throbbing hate boner this sub has for streamer privileges today, the only reason I’m able to play is because we caught the attention of Pestily who brought it to BSG’s attention."
DickeTitten69,"No they are not. Furthermore, I’m shocked BSG’s user data hasn’t been breached yet. Maybe it has and they haven’t reported it. Why would they. They seem to lack rules in their neck of the woods."

I can't even kill scavs without dying.
Now if that's a good thing, I'm not so sure"
Scarity,"I have several friends (4000+ hours), that almost report EVERYONE who kills them. It's fucking annoying to look at, because it makes me wonder how many 10+ times a day I get reported, since I blast factory and sometimes get 20+ kills an hour.

I sometime stream on twitch, with no cam, no voice, just to have some sort of 'record' of my games. But even then, getting unbanned seems impossible, even with proof.

I'm super glad you made this post, I feel the exact same 'stress' you talk about"
Minimum-Impression63,We are dealing with a Mickey Mouse company. This is par for the course.
Ovnii3,"I want to say 2 things

1. No, our accounts aren't safe.

2. BSG needs to wake up, and streamers could maybe get real one day and stop whining, they should realize that it's not cheaters that kill them, it's the shitty game tarkov has become (not that I won't play it lol). 

No, you weren't killed by a cheater through the wall, it's just the common desync.

No, the guy didn't tp behind you, you just couldn't hear shit with this audio.

Chill, this game isn't perfect dear major streamer, everyone faces the same issues that you do."
Solaratov,"Of course not.

Just look at the clowns on BSG's support team. They do nothing. They're worse than useless. So not only are we at risk of false bans, but we can't even appeal them."
Bheks,"To point out this isn’t the first we’ve had drama with a streamer getting an account banned.

I think it was a couple years ago, before lighthouse and when reserve was filled with loot. Tweak got merked by a player who was “teleporting”. The player was promptly banned.

The player was a small streamer/YTer (I don’t remember) who fortunately had a full recording of his POV and his end looked normal. So it was concluded that it was desync. Tweak ended up pleading for players case to BSG. So a much better outcome than what recently happened.

On a side note: I’ve been thinking about a most likely rare but possible scenario. Say there’s a cheater and they spam Player A in the head but the rounds don’t pen or just don’t kill them. A third non-cheating player B sees sees the fight and takes a shot at player A and it kills them. What’s player A gonna do? Report player B because it’s obvious that the way they died was a result of cheating. 

Obviously I’ll say, once again, that this is incredibly rare but possible. But taking a step back it seems like BSG have a game where even they can’t reliably ban actual cheaters vs. innocent players. 

The reality is that this game wasn’t built with cheaters in mind. The server sends all raid info to every client making radar hard to detect when ran through a second PC. Items being hard to acquire means the door has been opened for a lucrative black market. And now we’ve a dev team that won’t manual ban if a regular player provides concrete evidence but will do manual bans if a streamer sends a DM with no concrete evidence. It’s at the point where we’ve seen “white hat” cheaters who go around killing other cheaters so the lobbies are safe for regular players.

I’ve been playing the game for years on NA East. A region that’s typically the safest from cheaters. I can can’t on one hand how many times I’ve encountered a definite cheater. But now my concern what happens if I’m accused? What happens if I kill Landmark, Rengawr, Pest or Jesse? On top of spending $150 on EOD, do I now need to spend $100-$150 on 6TB HDD and record every raid? And just deal with the performance hit when I play Tarky.

And even with that setup it’s no guarantee that if I’m falsely banned I’ll get my account back. So then do I need hope and pray that I can make a big enough stink about it on Reddit and hope that the mods don’t take down my post? Right now I don’t want to play the game. I enjoy the game but I don’t want to risk being out the money. And I’m sure I’m not the only one.

Edit: Tweak got banned. Other player showed their VOD to BSG. Tweak was quickly unbanned."
eXiDeviiL,"I've migrated to SPT already, so much less migraines due to BSG's sheer incompetence or sweaty, ego-tripping streamers, also scavs can be made just as deadly there as this wipe's."
lupetto,"(this is a copy/paste from another thread, just to not type it again)

I also have a friend who has been banned a year ago (check my comments on this sub) under misterios circumstances (game ban, not BE ban for ""botting""). He had the bad habit of camping gate in Factory (bad habit = 30 times a day sometimes), stoped so many chads with the same saiga-12 with very little effort, with all this stories coming out (the admin banned guy, this) we wonder if that was the case (at the time we only speculated an error on BSG side). The guy is legit, he plays all kind of FPS and never had a bad track. 

This would not be an issue if this game actually had a costumer support. I remember one time I got permabanned from League Of Legends (i had the same account since S2 and never had a restriction of any kind, very rare for lol). Contacted support, replied within 20 minutes ""hey sorry, yes this is a big issue on our system, here is you account plus some stuff for the issue"" (they gave me 10 crates & keys).

Here the only thing you can do is HOPE that you make noise on Reddit to get an account back."
vgamedude,Bsg doesn't care about you or any normal person. This game is exclusively made with streamers and only streamers in mind.
infamous-fate,"No they are not safe. If anyone has access to your email your account will be fucking wrecked by them if they just spam different passwords. They dont even have to gain access to your account completely.

It was wipe day, i was so excited to get on after a year break.

I opened the browser and type in my information to sign in. Guess i missed one of the characters and got my password wrong one time. I got a 60 day game block until mid February.

Usually it doesnt give you game blocks for that long on your first mistake so someone knew the email i used for my account was compromised in someway. Support doesnt give a shit. I cant change my email. Its probably going to happen in the future if it really is compromised and it fucking sucks. My account has easily over 1500 hrs and ive been playing since it was publicly released as alpha. Goodbye eod"
fpslane,"Just a reminder that if your account gets banned falsely you will probably never get it back. I got banned over a year ago for running awakened poe trade in the background. I got banned for ""automation"" from battle eye. I had a edge of darkness account that I had played for a few wipes. Bsg will just ignore you if your not a big streamer and battle eyes support is non existent. It's so frustrating because if I could talk to a real person from bsg or battle eye I would be unbanned easily. All they have to do is see check that log from the anti cheat but since I don't stream $145 gone."
Grizz3d,"I'm still inexperienced enough that I don't think I'm even capable of killing a top tier player or streamer. 

Still, this is the only game where I always have Outplayed recording my gameplay 100% of the time as a precaution. I understand that many on this sub are tired of the subject now, but it's thanks to the outrage that a very bright light is being shone on this nonsense."
Leytarkhan,"I mean even when you are a streamer you are most likely allowed to cheat and not get banned for it.

There are numerous clips of streamers obviously knowing more than they should and they still play. I mean I remember a incident where a streamer litterally got called out in a match for using cheats by the guy who made the cheats as he claimed he can see the script running.

Strangely enough after that incident how the person played drastically changed.

I am convinced that a considerable ammount of streamers and a considerable part of the playerbase is cheating with either radar, some wallhacks etc. just not something outright obvious.

I am also convinced that the more people cheat and dont get banned for it more people will hop on cheats just to level the playing field. I mean we allready have cheaters that only hunt cheaters \^\^"
PoperzenPuler,"BSG is a Russian company. Russians associate the word ""transparency"" with a glass of vodka at most. 
That's why everything the BSG clowns do on the subject of banning is completely non-transparent. They constantly ban something randomly. The game has no replay function, not even BSG seems to have access to a replay. They just ban people like that. And if they can't get out of the number... no comment and ban is withdrawn. And here again... non-transparent. 
Sometimes I have the feeling BSG has banned at least twice as many innocent players as cheaters. 
In short... nobody is safe from BSG arbitrariness. Arbitrariness is a living culture in Russia."

mmoarpgfps,"Got banned at the start of 12.12. Whats funny tho is that it was a manual ban 229. 3k hours to the trash. Whats even more funny is that 229(manual bans) cannot be appealed or lifted(accordong to their own saying). But here we are, the guy the got manual banned got the ban lifted. While people like me and many others did nothing and still being banned with no way of recovering or appealing for the ban. 

If im not cheating and i still got banned i might better use cheats since, i will get banned nonetheless. Fuck bsg."

FetishForSex,"Just stop playing the game. I know it sucks but this is not going to change. These developers do not care about players, they only.give a shit about people promoting their game, and it's not gonna change.

The Cycle and Marauders are two of my favorite you should go support."
Certain-Mulberry9893,"Thank you!! I personally feel that Rengawr is def at fault here for rage reporting through a more direct line of communication, but at the same time, BSG is at more fault imo cause they didn’t review the clip or any background info. Even though bsg is giving streamers the ability to directly report someone (which I think they should, because they will run into more cheaters since they play more), bsg should still take time to validate a streamer’s report."

BSG in general has little to no regard for it's customers. They truly don't care as a business.

Streamers are free publicity so they get special attention. They've always given streamers free copies and extra gear, even before the big popularity boom in 2019"

This is in no way a BSG specific issue.  I got false positive banned by EAC (known for producing many false positives) from BF2042, and the response to my support tickets was effectively ""we do not make mistakes, go fuck yourself"".

Meanwhile, big popular streamer gets ban, tweets about it, and gets unbanned within a couple hours.

It's just a shitty fact of life that devs rely on streamers to advertise their games, creating a tiered system of support for players whereby the support they receive from devs is directly proportional to the press and hype they generate for the game."

ZeroCh4nce,"People its simple tarkov is a cash grab period. They dont unban unless you are a big streamer. Why? Simple they want you to buy another account. They love cheaters because its a constant money stream for them . You think someone is going to pay a large subscription each month for cheats and isnt going to rebuy the game if they get banned once in awhile? Its also why there isn't a active and rolling anti cheat instead they do ""ban waves"" every few months. 

Its rather simple you have 3 options. 1 just play the game and accept that your going to die alot and cheaters run the game. 2 play the game and constantly complain about cheaters, unlawful bans etc and be stressed and miserable.  3. Accept that it hasn't changed in 5 years and probably isn't going to change anytime soon and quit."
Difficult-Isopod6895,"I've found a great way to protect yourself from bullshit bans in this game, start by having the game open (alternatively, skip step one.)

3. Open steam / epic / chrome and Google addicting games or some shit
4. Play a game worth your time."
brendo2013,Time for those passive playthroughs everyone jokes about... real talk though this is a serious issue and it definetly needs to be spoken on from BSG. RENG needs sherpa removed. Other streamers need to be vocal for either side so the conversation stays relevant.

Had a dodgy death? or just wondering what happened? Well how about checking it in a ""theater mode"" like in call of duty games? once the raid ends, you can just go in and look at the raid from anyone's perspective. That solves literally almost every issue regarding cheating, as local replays with shadowplay etc. doesn't help shit. 

Personally in games, I very rarely report people. Games that have chat where someone's being a massive racist/homophobe etc. yes I will immediately report them. Anyone else being salty and toxic? I can just fucking block them if it upsets me, it's that god damn simple. People that just report everyone because they're salty need to re-evaluate what is **actually** worth reporting. The quick report button after dying in tarkov is too fucking quick, it means too many idiots will just go ""oh yeah he's hacking because I'm salty. let me just press this button as it only takes me half a second""

Ever since I saw people getting falsely banned in tarkov I've legitimately been scared for my account, as it seems to be very easy for them to just dick over a loyal player who's spent countless time and money on their game.

Nuggetsofsteel,"The short answer is no. There is a lot risk that you will be left out to pasture by BSG. They simply don't operate their development of the game from a perspective that providing their players with a stable working product is important. That clearly extends into account security and review.

And the real kicker is how a big component of the vocal community has helped foster an environment where BSG can be totally complacent. I mean, just look at the reaction to the Rengawr twitlonger. Yes, he acted like a complete dick getting the guy banned and his initial responses on the matter were out of touch. Regardless, in the twitlonger he apologizes, takes responsibility, and says he won't use the system going forward. That being said, if you go to comments you have swarms of people acting like he didn't apologize, putting all the blame on him, etc. Very few people put any blame on BSG. This is a BSG system, and a BSG decision. Yes Rengawr was complicit in that he pushed this through that system, but it is insane how few of the comments actually point the finger at the party that ultimately hit the ban button."

My mate, just last wipe, had his account stolen by a hacker who then proceeded to get my mates EOD account banned. BSGs response to my friend explaining the situation to them was “Too bad, your account, your problem”.

BSG does not give a fuck about this community unless you are giving them free promotion, like streamers/YouTubers…"
Medium-Argument908,"false bans happen in all games you couldnt name one game that doesnt have false bans

they should just make this game super hard again and let t0he streamers bandaid all the booboo"
No-Concentrate641,I bought a 13900k and a 4090 to upgrade my PC to play tarkov at 4k native. Installed it and next day im 60 day banned. I dont get it
Mad3yez,I know mines safe cuz I can't kill anyone
WorldlyDivide8986,"Well, feels like we are all just talking to ourselves."
DiffuseMAVERICK,"I use to stream a decent bit. No where near a point where I had any power to get someone banned or unbanned. But I had a viewer come to me and tell me he got banned, and BSG wouldn't tell him why. Around that same time which was this time last year a lot of people were getting hit with bans hard. It put a bad taste in my mouth so I kinda just quit playing EFT. My viewer never was unbanned and he never found out why. I've been playing DayZ more and honestly enjoy it more than EFT."
Kestrel1207,"Uh, no, they never have been. It's not like this is something new lmao. People acting as if this is the only type of false ban bsg does. There have been dozens and dozens of threads of people losing access to their accounts and customer support being a complete brickwall."
Roman576,"well. Fun part this is basically how things work in russia. You have a vluable position (or you are valuable for somebody who is in power) - you have connetions in gov oranizations. E.g. in police department, you tell that you want someone's business to be shut down across the street cuz you lose money - it happens. Interesting that this mentality transfered to a game where people that are more valuable for game dev can do things like these"
radeongt,I refuse to believe people who say their account got banned falsely. I have seen so many say that just to find out later they were just cheating.
TheMrSanta,"How do I get unbanned, I got random error 229 permanent account block, I even paid for edge of darkness account, can I get my money back if I can’t get unbanned"
Matiasfrodr95,"we still dont know if the guy was cheating or not, devs didn't say anything"
