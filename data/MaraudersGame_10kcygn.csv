,"Just a content drought.  To be expected from a game that released into early access to early.  Game has a bright future for sure, just going to take time to come to fruition"
SUNTZU_JoJo,"The game is still very much under development, has very limited content..of course playerbase will drop.

They have a husk of a game...needs to be stuffed with content now.

They've added a few new maps but the game needs more..

Compare this to tarkov..main big difference is all the weapon attachments and mods which makes 2 of the same gun feel completely different to use.

You don't get that option in this game so what is left?


All fights are cqb so no scopes.."
yeah_right_lag,"Before Red Baron update, the numbers were around here as well. 

It’ll bounce back when the next one comes."
TheseBeachesLoveSosa,I wouldn’t say it’s dying . But it’s getting quite stale. There is a lot of bugs with no quick fixes. And overall content is quite lacking. End game feels a little underwhelming at the moment and overall lootpool gets old quick
SilentDragaur,"I think overall the average is actually increasing. Not really including the first month or so of launch which had 5 to 15 thousand average players. And it looks like the peak players for the past month are around 2k.

FluffyPinkPantheon,"The big streamers that sit in pods ruin the game. I get that it is ""meta"" for getting marauder kills but sitting in pods in open space is a playstyle that should be discouraged as it makes no sense that leaving your ship makes you faster and far more imposing. The pod takes 2 shots worth of damage and is as fast as an interceptor when boosted if not faster which makes no sense when you look at the speed stats. All of this aside the space combat just feels absolutely garbage as a solo player because any ship other than the Rustbucket cannot used efficiently currently as the turret only ever points forward de-centivizing counterplay to pods as the risk is far to high for the payout and generally ends in the player losing their ship to many teams who are excited to see anything but a Rustbucket on the map. Call me crazy here folks but the lack of risk in piloting the Rustbucket and legit losing it every game feels very out of place for a hardcore shooter -- players should be incentivized to not scuttle a ship every game."
chesterhiggins,Tarkov wiped bro
b33rbashjawnsonTTV,Keep in mind its like afternoon on a tuesday
OverlordZombwich,"Most of us are waiting for issues to get ironed out before returning. Love the lore, the aesthetic and the weapons but the game needs a lot of work. I feel many in the community are trying to strong arm it in the wrong direction as well. They ask for things to stay the same or for changes that only benefit them rather than ones that would promote playerbase growth and retention. A big one is the breaching at match start. A TON of people quit playing because of it. Then you have people that quit because they don't want to devote any time if stuff is gonna wipe etc."
nervouswhenitseasy,i got bored on week 3 lol. i prestiged and they took it away from me. lack of content and now a lack of drive to play

Legogamer16,"Looking at the short time frame does nothing to tell you about population. 24-hour peak is a bit more useful, but really you need ti be looking at data and gain per month. 

Right now we have a bit if a content lull so less overall active players, but in the last 30 days there has been a 460 or 44.27% gain. 

I’d say the game is going steady, and not doing bad for itself considering how there really isn’t much in the game, as well as being a niche genre"
Ok-Bike-9564,"Look at the Playerbase of the Cycle Frontier. Extraction or Hardcore Extraction Shooter are no Mainstream.
But a small Playerbase can be okay, see Insurgency Sandstorm over many of Years. Little Playerbase but the Game is a success."
CountAntonius,1.0 has a chance to reignite some interest but till then every update will give it a little bump that quickly falls after people burn through the content.
mcgregger101,Yeah honestly I'm just waiting for some bug fixes and a bit more content then I'll start playing again love the game though
Jhonquack,It's not fully released and people beat all the content they wanted. Of course also there is a lot of issues and bugs with the game but it's early access so I'm not surprised. I still really really enjoy the game even with the bugs and am addicted so still gonna play but most people are waiting for it to be complete.
Shadow_Lazer,"It's not dead, it's not finished

&#x200B;

I like the game, but there isn't much content to enjoy, hacking is an issue, and it's a loot based game that will get wiped on release, people find it hard to get motivated to play"
Conmanjames,its a niche game still very early in development. its never had huge numbers
Whiteguysam22,"Well it’s still early access, so I’d say no it’s not dying if it hasn’t even fully released yet. Just a dry spell right now red baron update was cool but we need bug fixes right now and I’m sure a lot of people are just kind of waiting"
Sandy_Peener,Depending on time of day could be slow
TTV_xxero_foxx,It kinda is just because a lot of us who have been playing for the full lifecycle so far are just waiting for the next update to start testing again. It does currently get stale fairly quick after an update but it's still very small and growing. I expect that as we get closer to full launch there's going to be enough to keep players busy for a long time
maimutadeadlax,Yes
Apprehensive_Fee1922,Will be back next update personally. Game isn’t even officially launched yet.
Potato-6,Always has been
dge001,Checkout the death certificate  on  deathverse: let ut die. It died with in the week of release  less than 100.
D0_0t,"Just waiting for bugs to be fixed for me. Played this game damn near everyday for a few weeks, but kept getting tired od inventory bugs. Waited a few months and came back for red Barron. Inventory AND multiplayer lobby bugs still persisted. Immediately uninstalled. 

Just needs to run a lot better before it can retain the people it started with. Not to mention lack of content, but that will come in time."
Xowatle,"No not really, just waiting for the game to come out I. Full to not deal with complete wipes or progress"
Realist419,"More bumping than ever, IMHO. The only thing that keeps dying is me."
Legacy_Service,"I'm not ready to rag on this game yet, but im getting there."
theTinTank,I just didn’t like the map design or gunplay so I quit playing. I hope they can make something cool out of this game though.
whitenoise89,"Not dying, just niche and beta-ish.

I’m refraining from playing until I feel like it’s closer to “finished”"
geckobrother,"Content drought, and it took a pretty big hit when they announced that they would reset every major patch. I think a lot of people went from no-lifing it to planning on just hitting it for a few days every major patch."
Daedalus308,"Remember, the school semester is now in full swing, a lot of students have less time to play"
Jman10002,I got tired of dying to the same top 10 leaderboard people.
CreativityAtLast,Lol I’m subbed to you on YouTube
MattDamnit,It's like the cycle. Fun game not enough content.
HZ4C,"There’s hardly any meaningful progress.

Why try and level up the faction shops? You’ll never struggle for loot in this game. And it’s so slow going the incentive isn’t worth it. The main quest line is is poorly balanced, it goes from an easy task to VERY hard one back to easy again. Expanding into other ships still isn’t worth it, better to just sell them for $22k and move on you can fly to the destination in like 30seconds and work on getting to the real meat of the game.

LOVE this game, there’s just no progress to be done. It’s basically a battle Royale lol"
ANDROIDHAMMERRACING,It will if they don't fix the bugs that ruin gameplay.
Psychological_Ring_3,I hope not. This has replaced hunt showdown for me
squidtugboat,"I think it needs some refining still, has a pretty dedicated base"
Blue_Eyed_Brick,The game just has very little content + buggy af
Whynotplaythetuba,Iv been running into a lot of cheaters the last week it feels like.. made me play less
Pleasant_Issue,"The wipes are tough…. Its tough to grind the start again as a casual gamer(The majority).

 I understand why wipes are needed while in early access but I’ll be playing a ton more when Wipes are done"
RealSwiftEagle,"There's currently not much reason to play at the moment. Since there will be another wipe for sure. When the games is fully released, it will hopefully be a bug free game all polished and then I'll be playing it to the max"
laughingskull00,for me just other games tbh my list is packed and I still got alot to do
Kiu16,Updates are too slow plus lack of transparency outside of the discord. Release was big because of the steam home page ad but since then they put 0$ in marketing
RyTheRedemered32,"It'd bound to happen, I've stopped playing but I do love the game, I just wish there was something to do. I want them to make ships really worth looking after, like a tarkov hideout. Hideout in tarkov is one of the few reasons I get hooked into it. For others it maybe max traders or kappa, this game doesn't really have the equivalent of that either yet. But it is early access so I'd rather them nail the gameplay fully before investing too much time in making a ""endgame"""
,FYI all games are slowly dying.
rennfeild,The frequent crashes killed my motivation.
Kullet_Bing,"Well the game keeps its marketing budget low at the moment, the overall setting of the game is not the taste for many people and overall the game is quite basic in content, put in your 50 hours at best and you have seen everything.

Even if it drops below 100 concurrent players there'll be nothing to be afraid of, the company got money as the sales were good and they can continue developing. They just need to release a huge update combine it with a marketing campaign and the game will be populated."
TheGoatEmoji,Nope! I just started playing & enjoy it so far!
jpette_242,"I hope not, myself and 3 others just started playing earlier this week."
bobbyblanksjr,The repeated random dying while piloting my ship to an exit was enough for me to put it on the shelf indefinitely. I imagine others feel the same way.
Apart-Ad5085,I don’t think so. It’s in pre-dev anyways so I don’t take these numbers seriously. One good fat update and you’ll see the peak numbers hit again.
SkyWizarding,This is basically every PC game. There are just a lot of options out there
Physical-Bet-9656,nah all the shit heads are in school more inlikly
imAwdeeOtherSide,"These are hunt showdown numbers during the same time in their early days. It has a bright future. Personally for me I got bored after about 50 hours I haven't played since. The most recent updates haven't been enough for me to load the game up. 

My personal gripes. Maps play way too similar, some maps if it wasn't for the outside I couldn't have told you it was a different map. There isn't enough to do or grind for at the moment. Combat is pretty fun but not ""oh sht I can't believe I clutched that"" type of feeling. 

I love the overall direction. Just not enough for me to go back to yet."
