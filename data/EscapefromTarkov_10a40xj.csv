Scavwithaslick,You can hear him breach the door after killing you
TECHNOV1K1NG_tv,"I was expecting the 1 tap from scav on the MG in stronghold, but this is way better lol"
BeepHasRisen,"I did a Woods raid and got two tapped with x54 less than 15 seconds into raid.

Total bullshit imho."
egiantmirror_skilled,Birdeye moment
gladbmo,"*Barges in  
Kills you  
Breaches Door on Way Out*"
DasDunXel,"Yeah you aggro them via the windows.
Some reason they won't shoot those windows.  Upstairs they will maybe because of the actual holes.
Either way they rush that location they saw you at.  Birdseye silent movement won't typically give any notice their coming of he's first..  Closing that door typically triggers his kick in mechanics first but him appearing before was a dumb bug.

I like to run in there loot duffel.  Run out shut door and hang out in the next room down the hall ready for right hand peak. 
If they are there and saw you.  They should be kicking in that door in like 10-30 seconds of looting the duffel.
So far this wipe only birdseye has come inside.  The other two will just chill outside the front (hole In wall side) talking and shifting around.

Upstairs broken windows.  If you can bait them 2-3 of them will charge up the metal stairs within 10-20 secs of shooting the windows.  You can corner lean from either room and kill them one by one as they come in."
shady531,"Totally fucking unacceptable. Can we get this to the top? Devs need to see how bad their AI is.

He ran thru the door before it opened and then head eyes you in less than a half second."
Steid55,I accidentally ran into bird eyes as a scav in crack hiuse the other day. He kept whiffing his shots. Literally point blank. Has to shoot him 6 times with a double barrel 12 gauge. Ended up with a blacked stomach but survived and got his shit out
llasse22kd,"Even tho this is horrible, it's comedic af"
c0vex,"As a reminder this game is in development since 2016, and it gets only worse."
binnysinny3,Clear skill issue
mrgnome1538,The fucking door didn‚Äôt even open
Zer0Cyber_YT,I thought this was a hacker until I realized it was Birdeye. Either way yeah that's bullshit
codman606,I would of quit for the day.
Minimum-Impression63,BSG is the Mickey Mouse Club of developers.
2kMurray,"i had birdeye shoot me through the wall there, if you hear them your getting fucked"
jeff5551,"I love how some people in here are still blaming you when he activated fucking Vision phasing, never change Tarkov sub"
ReitInvestor,Look at my man‚Äôs ping in the top right hand corner. This one is on him. He‚Äôs jumping between 130-155 ping
Mysterious_Tap_1647,"If it makes you feel better you wouldve needed to hit him directly in the head to kill him. But yeah, Birdeye didn't give a fuck about that door"
UncleEggma,This is my favorite tarkov video of all time now lol
FlawlessRuby,Working as indeed.
SXNova,"so bosses do in fact exist

such surprise"
Aphexxftw,it sucks but you were gonna die regardless based on your kit lol
Nukeman1303,‚ÄúWe really want the game to feel like you‚Äôve been punched in the dick
adfsagos,I like how he instantly turns away like you were nothing. lmao
RedScope53,Ah yes. Tarkov. This is why I don't play you anymore.
MyGoi762,Watching it made me feel better than looting a whole pack of raiders. Thanks OP
jlebrech,that's what you get for dragging your loot
PoorLittleLamb,You loot dead scav first eh?
mrfudface,Not saying that any Armor at all would've saved you at this point. But you went in naked?
UniqueUserII,"This isn't a ping issue, the desync this wipe has been absolutely terrible and the reason you died here."
Wyntier,"looked at ping

&#x200B;

kept scrolling"
jeffreyhu98,OP's playing on EU servers from NA...what do we expect to happen? i get it 150 stable ping isnt unplayable.. but its bad. Not to mention its probably not stable.
TenraxHelin,One of the reasons i've put that game on hold. That's why I've been playing DMZ. Not as intense but similar feel.

DukeLander,welcome to cheatkov
VoidVer,"Homies ping is bouncing between 120-140. He shouldn't even be allowed to connect to this server. You think this is bad from his perspective, now imagine that because of his ping, he does this ( or similar bullshit level desync shit ) to other PMCs. 

Play on a server closer to you please. You'll avoid dying to BS like this and you will also avoid killing people in ways that feel cheap and shitty."
Unrealztik,"lmao, u poor man RIP"
0utF0x-inT0x,"You found the boys, I guess they found you actually lol"
SpicyPringlez,It's called getting robocopped
MisterWafflles,Netcode
heathy28,"the bosses and other AI's can be super aggressive, I haven't seen the cultists for a while but I did see them once on shoreline at the resort and I thought they were cheaters they run FASTTT. truly is a horror experience at night."
BitterQuitter11,You expected him to not ghost-walk the door? You pleb.
hughie1987,That didn't look like ai to me with that decked out gun and the one on his back but idk
Donnerheld,"Getting tarkoved without lube, the video."
iicarusNA,"samething happened to me with tagilla, he was standing on one end of office and before i even had my gun up he teleported into me and i died instantly, wasnt even chasing me he was chasing my friend who ran past me"
Reggie2b2t,I literally thought this was a cheater video before noticing it was birdeye
BeefyZealot,Lmao‚Ä¶ How did we get suckered into paying $150 for this shit game??? HOW ON EARTH IS THERE A SINGLE PERSON DEFENDING THIS?!? Daddy Nik is the Bernie Madoff of pc gaming.
alvaro761991,skill issue
lilsparklee,I have a clip of this happening to me and my squad on labs
DelugeFPS,You got the bird is the word'd.
TheFunkadelicOne,I had one floating in the resort on shoreline.  At least he wasn't phasing through walls lol
FoxLP11,"yea scav ai has been phasing through doors and onetapping me alot too, not even kidding"
Accomplished-Lord,Fuck this game man
nOobeynoodleman,This is a certified Escape From Tarkov moment
morklonn,"If it makes you feel any better, the goons aggro'd me when I was at RUAF and they were around crackhouse. They were trying to shoot me through the wall from like 75 yards away."
bungothecat,"It's honestly ridiculous. Didn't even know they were in my raid, I kill a scav in construction site and all 3 run from skeleton area and stare at me instant lmao."
Chaos744,Clear loser hacker. People suck man.
Zealousideal_Ad1110,Am I the only one finding that there is no problem here except a git gud one ? This is 100% legit atm even if he breached the door the pmc would have died from being chased
Dgarey94,Spawned there and went upstairs. 10 sec in I'm doubletapped through the glass by him
fireballmx,"This actually not as bad as when I died in that exact spot before they toned down the scavs - I got one shot by a scav who jumped on the MG at stronghold while I was looting the body. No warning, no noise, hadn't even been behind crackpots at all. Just instant death not even a couple mins into the raid."
321J123,Me and a couple buddies spawned in a room next to klimov street on Streets. And the off map sniper was lighting us up through the walls. The rubber-banding that was going on made it so we couldn‚Äôt leave the room and we died after a minute. The game is very broken and borderline unplayable.
slicktrickrick,Man something like this happened to me today. I was in the repair shop on customs chilling and a PMC comes in and immediately one taps me
MalaiseEnthusiast,"Isn't this fun and engaging AI behaviour? ""Bro, I swear, bro, raiders, rouges and bosses are beatable, bro, you just have to play carefully and tactically, bro. You're such a pussy for not wanting to fight them bro..."" Fuck ooooooff"
Naytham,Skill issue
BigShrekDaddy69,It's called a gaming chair guys chill
Ghost0fDawn,ITT: Everyone's an expert Networking Engineer
speedlead3,"good job bsg, the AI in this game is completely fair and not broken, just like you ""anti-cheat"" methods."
loongod5,skill issue
danieljackheck,People not CTRL+click to quickly move stuff into their backpack is a minor trigger for me.
MenaBeast,Did your shots even register?
Ooops_I_Reddit_Again,Was that a pmc? Or a cultist or something?
iiHadouken,Shit on
omegapenta,At least i'm not the only one experiencing this wtf is going on.
arxbidelic,Their ai were probably extra fucked bc tagged and cursed
XenithDragon,"People saying that the AI isn't the problem are clowning. This specific example is the servers most likely, but the AI is utter ass. Some days they are literal aimbot god's, 360 head tapping you, and other days they act likely they haven't ever heard of a gun and can't hit shit for the life of them. They aren't interesting to fight at all, and can all be easily cheesed, they just stand around and run one way, but they make up for it by having increased health and aimbot"
benelonari,you got ur ass clapped by that raider lol
TheOGjones23,That‚Äôs tarkov for ya ü§¶üèª
SenpaiBoogie,Lmao damn
shashungyo,PMC jump scare
SINGCELL,"Sick game, clearly a skill issue"
Dwenki,"Ahhh yes, the famous ghost ability of bird eye, and his 260 no scope ""head-eye"" shot ; it's a new features. Honestly it's an unfortunate bug, sorry for you dude... But he have a really good gaming chair after all."
BigAsian69420,Defo skill issue
Dontwonbemyfriend,Never even ran into any of the goons and I'm level 23 and run mostly customs
Wooden_Negotiation94,I can smell the brick in your pants from just watching the video
mrfudface,"Died twice this way while I attempted to loot the USEC Camp on Woods on a night raid. Well not this close but more likely getting one tapped. My guess is, that the guy that spawned closest somehow triggered them & either got killed by them or moved on (with the new audio it's allways a bit ... tricky to call).  By the way I spawned on Outskirts or next to the ZB014 Bunker."
wantonbobo,*X-files intro starts playing *
Mips0n,"Shit Like this is what Made me Stop playing the Game.

Such Things just cant Happen in such a punishing Game Like tarkov. Gameplay is already hard enough. It's Just No Fun when, on top of this, Bugs and cheaters randomly reset your progress"
Zer0_Logic,"Happened to me on dorms with reshala goons, first death of wipe"
MFH44,"That‚Äôs called desync, your sitting still. He entered the room and blew your brains out on his screen but on yours it‚Äôs not matching up"
Martin_RageTV,That red hot ping will fuck you.
tflyvt,Skill issue
neckbeardfedoras,The ol' reverse koolaid
Dapper_Dan66,I had a scav rush my at spawn and killed me within 20 secs in raid
Wulfay,is this streets?
Bradur-iwnl-,When the goons are so op they can bend space time to kill you before they breach the door.
No_Potato6634,i know you think going into raid without armor is saving you money but it‚Äôs not boss. when you die to a scav you lose your bread anyways get good & get some ruble in your acct boi
NeekoBe,"Kind of unrelated, but i thought birdeye had 'cultist' silent movement? U can clearly hear him coming..."
Turbulent-Wolf8306,Im not even sure if the shit ai or shit servers are to blame but holy fuck.
JollyReading8565,Is that cheater or rubber banding on streets of tarkov lol ?
Luminisc,"""FBI OPEN UP"""
monkey5005,Dnclip
PharmAttack,Did you guys not see the ping? Dude was DCing hard.
Turusenperkele,I keep seeing these flying men almost every game I m on europe server is there server that doesnt have this much cheaters?
zarial6,"I mean, you're just bad at the game obviously"
MadMikeyB,Yoo BirdEye on Customs someone update GoonTracker!
noahsark02,No rig ? Isn‚Äôt that one of the 2 tagged and cursed reasons?
Kaneypoo69,Maybe play on a local server? What is that ping man
Omisco420,Git gud
Level_Remote_5957,Yeah the raider bosses are legit I think more horrifying then killa and Tagilla. Because they spawn in one of the few areas with no scavs but when they spawn it's like a police raid in pay day 2
DepressionHimself,I fucking hate this game
ChucklesAcademy,I like how he just skedaddled out of the room as if there were more pressing issues at hand
HighlightFun8419,"i love how he *immediately* turns to leave. inhuman levels of confidence in his one-tap. not even interested in loot. just ""*Fuck this guy in particular*"" and then immediate 180 out of there.

the disrespect."
H3AVY_W3APONS,"I can't believe how bad these servers still are despite the game being out for 7 years. Absolutely unbelievable. And to then have the audacity to have ""tournaments"" and twitch partnerships to raise money just to invest a fraction of it into development and have the rest go right into their pockets. The slow paced development and lack of content is another major issue but it's totally fine guys because iTs JuSt A bEtA. The best excuse nowadays for developers to leave themselves all the time in the world to develop their games. Now for games in general I don't want a rushed game like Cyber Junk: 2077 but at the same time it is just embarrassing how long developers can use that beta excuse in today's times. I absolutely love Tarkov and have been playing it since day 1 but it's clips like the one above that make me close the game for the day and play something more polished.


tl;dr: it should be illegal for the game to be in this state after it having been out for almost a century."
Stinkypits2,*skill issue*
sixnb,"Be happy OP, they just made a bunch of ammo and availability changes instead of fixing broken jokes like this that have been a thing for years. 

/s"
jloll1,"Bsg hasn‚Äôt made a boss that feels good. They think aimlock and other superhuman bullshit is ‚Äúhard‚Äù (which, I guess it is), but imagine if there was a boss level ai that didn‚Äôt require cheesing. That‚Äôs my main turn off this wipe. I don‚Äôt want to play this game if everything difficult requires some bullshit strategy that you get from YouTube. You shouldn‚Äôt have to cheese everything in this game, from rogues to raiders to the ‚Äúgoon squad‚Äù. If you‚Äôve run into killa this wipe, you‚Äôll know he‚Äôs the most retarted he‚Äôs ever been. I‚Äôm done with it"
B0BBYbaby,Ill just grab this bandage üòÇ
New-Needleworker-568,"I know some people are saying the ai is broken (they fixed it a couple days ago), it‚Äôs actually a player cause of the USEC uniform so he was most likely a cheater."
Chinpokkomon,you know i would be okay with the ammo changes if this shit wasnt so horrid
AdConfident7002,"Hahahaha fuck. Sometimes you just need to accept it‚Äôs meaningless pixels that you are losing, and laugh at the absurdity of this game."
TheCommonPlant,you spin me right round baby right round? L :/
datNoobstuffz,"""lol skill issue get good kid"""
Iteroparous,Skill issue
Raendolf,Its getting annoying. Either Scav Run or PMC they are always there. I never encountered cheaters before but this wipe is enough for 3.
Ghost0fDawn,"whats the difference between cheaters and AI?  


The cheaters will leave the raid when they fill up on loot."
Unspoken,tagged and cursed due to not having an armor or vest on
