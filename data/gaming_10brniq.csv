01Sszecret,"One of my favorite games of all time. Easily sunk thousands of hours into it (with the help of NAM as well). 

[The soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6Pg0j_k3_o&list=PL271D01492F1B52BB) still has one of the greatest combinations of licensed and original tracks out there. ElectriCity, Oasis, and Street Sweeper in particular are fantastic."
RTGac,A game that will probably never get a proper sequel. Such a damned shame.
jenn363,Those splines are so reticulated it brings a tear to my eye
therealslystoat,The region mechanic was so cool. I loved making obscene amounts of money by exploiting it and shipping off junk to a garbage city.
fmsg11,Still have the original CDs: 1 for install and the other to play. And the key in the back of the manual to install
Attentive_Senpai,"Twenty years later, I still have unreal amounts of fun with this damn game."
AstronautAppleSauce,"Today is my 36th birthday, didn't know I share the same birthday with one of my favorite games ever. Thanks for sharing!"
Calorie_Killer_G,"SimCity 4 was simply a godswnd when I was in highschool. I used to spend a ton of time just making landscapes and while I played a lot of city builders out there, this one is simply my favorite. The atmosphere, the presentation, the UI, and God, the Music! I wouldute that crappy music from Cities Skylines and play the old SimCity 4 music in the back ground."
N7riseSSJ,I looooved Rush Hour and being able to take control of individual cars and driving as them.
deadlikemysoul,I'd always go bankrupt lol
havaska,Sim City 3000 was my all time favourite. My PC could never run Sim City 4 properly :(
Jetlaggedz8,Such amazing music.
Mondo114,"Game would always start chugging a couple hrs in for me, despite having a great modern computer. I wonder if it would still do that."
A_Filthy_Bandit_Main,"thought the two images were the same image, was wondering where you got these absolute massive buildings lol"
Sea_Perspective6891,Shame EA ruined the Sim franchise.
Single_Bug_5173,"I remember playing Sim City on the SNES for hours on end as child/teenager.   
Good times."
foreverlearner101010,I just barely started playing this again after Christmas. It’s so different as an adult and with the bug fixing mods. It’s actually a really great game to play in 2023 and I prefer it over Skylines.
XxXquicksc0p31337XxX,Fun fact: SC4 can also be used to create neighborhood terrains for The Sims 2!
poopshooter69420,"Man that’s wild, I never played the series beyond sim city 2000. Cities skylines on the other hand…"
dirtynj,"This, Red Alert 2, and Counterstrike were my high school games. So many hours."
asianwaste,Great... now I have that mad sax from Rush Hour playing in my head... and that sax WON'T CALM THE FUCK DOWN!
seansy5000,Check out OP’s post history. If you like sim city and want to see some really well laid out shit they’re awesome.
ananasSauce11,"I wish I could understand how to successfully play this game, but I never did.

I NEVER had a single city which developed skyscrapers like in this pic, and I don't know anyone in real life who managed to.

I also always ran out of money and had no idea how you were supposed to make decent money because even after fine tuning operational costs of public services and raising taxes, you'd still make like 500 profit every month, which was way too little for any meaningful expansion."
TraumaHandshake,I have had at least one Sim City 4 world going at all times since it came out.
Treshcore,"Such a great game. I loved playing it deeply, even though understood a little in the economy. Also, I even created custom maps for The Sims 2 in SimCity 4. It was amazing.

Now I mostly play Cities: Skylines when it comes to a city building strategy, but I will never forget these roots. Happy anniversary, SimCity 4!"
D0g3log,I still play simcity 2000
0utlook,I still play Sim City 2000 on my laptop. Got it through GOG and it runs in a DosBox.
teut509,I loved the set of Sim games where you could make a city in Sim City 2000 and then drive around it or fly a helicopter in the other games. Not been done since.
rastafunion,"As someone who grew up on Sim2000, that title fucked me up."
Shama_Heartless,"Best city builder you say?

You must be talking about Caesar 3."
stevej3699,"One of??

The only

Still today"
B_easy85,One of the few games I can play high as a kite…
chitownadmin,My absolute favorite of all times
Earth-Mandalorian,I could never get to this far in the building process. I would start accruing debt and the environmental factors would screw me up. I felt like I couldn't keep up with water and power without damaging the environment or running out of space.
jadeskye7,Such a great game. At least the spiritual sequel cities skylines is fucking awesome.
SquidKidG,"Sim, Sim City wasn't made for you."
spongewisethepicked,This game was awesome.
-Lordsocke-,No one gonna mention that red circle?
Kent_Knifen,That city screenshot is so heavily modded lol
Ivantheasshole,"How do you get such a high concentration of skyscrapers… I just cant, no matter what I do ugh"
Rogukast1177,City Destroyer Simulator
Fr000m,*furiously summons aliens*
Moneyshot_ITF,Now im all about Tropico
nutsinabutt,"Loved this game, I still play it every couple of years"
olGlassCleaner,I can't get it to work properly
GaryNOVA,Sim City 2000 and 3000 were more my speed.
Snoo_75138,Still amazed how EA managed to destroy such an amazing series...
Feisty-Crow-8204,"r/uselessredcircle

But yeah, great game."
PeterServo,SimCity reboot was like replacing a real building with Legos.
Winterclaw42,I liked that one.  Shame it gives me some kind of weird error now.
Matttagram89,How am I the first one to comment 4/20
GforceDz,"SimCity 4, I still remember playing Simcity.

I remember playing it at my Dad's office.
I even found my a copy of the game at college years later with my saved games."
bumpywigs,"Huh wow I remember this coming out it was a disaster the message boards were rammed with unhappy gamers saying it wasn’t finished, guessed nothings changed"
brusiddit,Is this the one that was launched as online only and had tiny squares to build on?
dap00man,4!? When did 3 come out? How old is 2000?!?!
reflUX_cAtalyst,We're a little young for the actual best city sim ever - SimCity 200 - aren't we?
Adh1434,City skylines is my new sim city
cbftw,Isn't this the game that was garbage and outshined by Cities Skylines?
MajorEnvironmental46,Are Cities Skylines a joke for you?
Eskitz,Nothing beats city skylines tho
TheF-inest,I played a lot of this but I was never able to get skyscrapers like this lol
ChamChamss,r/usefulredcircle
SamTV33,A true masterpiece
gutforhire,420 ehh? ehh?
EmpressBea,"I played the original simcity. And the sequel
And the sequel until there weren’t any more. I spent so many happy hours managing my cities and watching them grow. Skylines is fun but it’s just not the same."
yaboymilky,My parents would turn the wifi off at 9pm on school nights and 10pm on weekends. I would play this most nights throughout middle school and high school. The soundtrack was incredible.
DesertGaymer94,By far one of my favorite games!
WolfySpice,"Rush Hour was great. I still remember SimCopter and Streets of Simcity, playing in my own SC2K maps."
MBVakalis,Did they just never make a sequel?
American_Greed,Is there a good city builder that doesn't have a focus on road building?
mshriver2,420 haha
Sweet_Cherry_lady,"Does anyone have any advice about the Sims analog for playing on Bluestacks. I've been playing a lot of different games lately, but I can't find anything like Sims. If there are suggestions, I will be grateful."
thisisjazzymusic,What a gem of a game this was
morbihann,"Was pretty nice game.

It was cool that you could have deals with neighbouring towns.

I was excited for 5, but boy, did they fucked that up."
eonicsilas,amazing game!
mudohama,What’s that UI? Mod? Promo?
iamonewiththeforce,"Ha! Even after all these years, I'm still older than SimCity 4!


*Cries in old age*"
CertifiedFreshMemes,Damn those graphics are still beautiful
w8watm8,"Ok, but what the fuck is the red circle highlighting?! 

I have to know!"
Alternative_Gold_993,That city and surrounding area looks like a nightmare to get around as a civilian.
Fartmatic,I always used to love building a crowded city that ends up with all sorts of traffic and freight logistics problems just for the satisfying feeling of mercilessly demolishing corridors through it to create highways and a rail network.
ZookeepergameDue8501,I actually played this not long ago
Sussy_Orphan,"Sims......
Sims city wasn't made for u"
Soviet_Beer,Sim City 5 was such garbage
mahonii,"Need to play again, just wish I could build a city that size successfully"
blaingummybear,"Incredible. Spent a huge chunk of my early teens on this game. Finally got to play it again during the pandemic.

It was nice being an essential maintenance tech that noone wanted in their unit. Basically 6 months of cheap gas and playing on my laptop every day."
MedricZ,Stop
eremite00,I was a tester on this game. That was back when Maxis was in a completely separate location from EA. I wished that Arcologies had been included.
OncewasaBlastocoel,"Was this the first one with a ""space port""? I played the shit out of that one."
Lazuli9,"Loved this game. The missions were really awesome. I installed a bunch of mods like high density residential buildings that took up one square, different skyscrapers etc. I used to get my money to a very specific looking number and then use some program that changes values and give myself billions of dollars to build a utopia. Was fun using different maps from IRL too, I liked doing New York City and Istanbul"
EmbraceMyGirthMortal,SimCity 4 and the Original Sims were such great and creative games. I hate what EA has done to both of them now. Sims now just feels so soulless and I don’t want to pay 600$ for addons
thecwestions,"Last one I played was Sim City 3000.  Outside of a really laggy system when the city got large/ complex,  it was a mind-bogglingly fun and addictive game. I wish they'd make a new one."
CalCOMLA,All of the gamers I know disparage this franchise hard.
Vivarax,A game that has bugs that you can buy as dlc
AzraelleWormser,"Back when I started the SimCity games (with the original) my goal was always to build the biggest, most populous city I possibly could, and since I didn't understand zone planning whatsoever, I never managed to get big cities.

By the time I got to SC4, I had a better understanding and was able to finally achieve those goals. But another wild concept came to me: building a small rural town and keeping it small! I found a fascination with just making a village surrounded by farmland, with a little commercial Main Street in the center. I'd connect it to all the other large cities around it (thanks to the region map) and even had highways connecting those regions to each other, with my little farming community between them. It was a nice zen garden-style experience between the hustle and bustle of the big cities."
Logondo,"I was terrible at this game because I was just a little kid. But I played so much of it.

The OST is very nostalgic to me."
Jeheh,I've recently picked SimCity4 again after being away for a while..talk about memories. I jus realized I've been playing this on and off  in its various forms for over 30 years
Riconas,Happy Simcity 4/20 Years! 😄
MajaMystic256,"Its still the best city builder sim out there for me

I love it"
acelaya35,"I don't know, SimCity 2000 was 1996 better than 4"
Chuckles1188,"I really struggled with it - wanted to love it more than I did, but my allegiance will always lie with SimCity 3000. I still sunk an ungodly amount of time into New Coventry though"
ShittyBlender,"One of the first youtube videos that got me to buy a game was a video showing this massive city with ""We didn't start the fire"" played over top of it lmao.

Sometimes I try and find that vid...  I think it's gone forever."
Autarch_Kade,"I wish SimCity 2013 had worked well.  I love the idea of building cities with friends, specializing and working together, and seeing what they come up with.

Wish other companies would give it a shot."
Gloverboy6,"Still play it once in a while 

Played SC3k back in the day too"
ctannr,I miss Sim Tower :-(
danegraham9,Is this modded?
Rough_Promotion,Nice.
Caspaa,"Scrolled through and didn't see it mentioned but SC4 has some amazing mods! And I've heard it said that it is, to this day, the most realistic city simulator ever made.

The traffic simulator was so advanced when they made it that most machines couldn't run it, so they had to dial it down on release. You can turn it back up and adjust it with mods though and it's great!"
Particular-Dancer,"This game was incredible, would love to play it again"
The_Liamster,I’ve been playing a lot of Cities Skylines lately. Last time I checked I was nearing 500 hours of playtime
DukeBeefpunch,I had never played this and thought it was one picture and the game had Judge Dredd style megablocks
DooglarRampant,I remember being excited for Sim City 2. Jesus.
Djackdau,*The* best city builder. Nothing else even comes close.
goodtimegamingYtube,"Loved that game so much. And my cousin Vinnie,  he always came through in a pinch for my less than stellar management."
electric-angel,with out the rose glasses i do like skylines better. but i do have love for it still
LordOFtheNoldor,Sheeesh
High_Priest_Imothep,"Sorry, how difficult is to create a game ""freeware"" like SC4? Example Civilization 2 and Freeciv."
vigourtortoise,How should I set the tax rates? I always feel like I screwed it ip.
Gunofanevilson,Indeed
kahlzun,How does it hold up 20 years later? Can I recommend it to the kids?
,If only cities skylines wasn't such a demanding game and my room didn't get about 10 degrees hotter every time I played it
aesthezel,Oh yes! The best with no discussion
imhungrie,4 20 nice
Swordbreaker925,"My first thought was “damn, that looks pretty good for a game from the 80’s/90’s”.

Then i remembered I’m old and 20 years ago was 2003…"
cumslave1989,"Was this the one that required always on internet?
If so...this marks the 20th anniversary of me turning my back on PC gaming!
I hated and remain so against this...I stopped playing PC games 

Command and conquer red alert 2 Yuri's revenge is the last game I ever installed."
DillieDally,What's the red circle in the pic?
Purple-Cow1607,"Nah, lack of recreation parks and mountains with forest."
CryptidsnHoaxes,Hehe 4 20
bigred1978,"I so so wish that a remake of this classic was made.  Updated everything but keep the isometric and the general UI style and some other aspects.  Just optimize it for multicore, 4K+ graphics and an AI engine that can simulate as best as possible how a city and its citizen's function."
Kaepora25,EA destroyed the franchise after that. I think the spiritual successor would be cities skylines tho even it doesn't have some of the features of SC4.
VRascal,"I can hear the music/musac now, great memories..."
LearningSpanishRN,"What!!! I grew up playing this game, that’s crazy."
verbosity,It still breaks my heart that I had to give up SimCity 5 and move over to Cities: Skylines.
Azurehue22,H ow do people get cities like this? Mine crash and burn before I get I’ve skyscraper…
Speckled_Jim90,"Yeah this was just a great game.

I enjoy Cities: Skyline - that's excellent - but for some reason I just prefer SimCity 4. Maybe it's nostalgia, but it was just so much fun. And a challenge too."
TheBurningTitan,I wish I had the patience to build nice cities instead of looking like garbage bin
WhiteRun,This game helped me understand budgeting and management. No joke. It's my career now and I think this game had a huge influence on that being my strong points.
GhostRiders,"I have a dream where somebody does an update to Sim City 2000..

Sim City 2000 with upto date modern graphics... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!!!!"
Aldermere,"I bought it not to long ago on Steam but haven't played much yet. 

My biggest frustration is constantly having to bulldoze existing areas so I can add in bigger roads, highways, subway stations, etc. as the city grows.

Would love to have a map laying out all the transpo needed for a large city so that I could start a small one within the appropriate tiles so that I would never need to destroy them to add in transpo as the need arose."
flow-addict,"Is it worth it? I've read that cities skylines is better in every way, but my pc barely runs it and the long loading times takes all my motivation to play."
Best-Bread8986,"You call it a city builder, I call it a war crime simulator

We are not the same"
GuerreroUltimo,"I love this game.  A few times I went through the process of making it work for higher res. and all that kind of stuff.  But just finally jumped to Cities Skylines now.  I installed SimCity 4 and finally did do all the stuff.  But not sure if I will play or not.  Game is great.  Just wish it looked a little better at this point.

&#x200B;

As for the SimCity sequel.  The one where even today my fire trucks will all converge on one place and let everything else burn.  Or the other problems as well.  What a shame.  It could have been great.  I would buy ""SimCity 4, the 2023 polished edition"" if they just would do some stuff.

&#x200B;

It is just so strange how much I want SimCity 4 when I play Cities: Skylines.  Not that Skylines is some bad game.  But there are some things in 4 that I feel draw me back."
Hero_of_our_times,Has any modern game ever come close to this masterpiece?
BeastModeBuddha,"Been playing for twenty years, and I'll probably be playing for twenty more. Always loved this series!"
separategusto971863,"After that, EA ruined the franchise. Even though it lacks some of the features of SC4, I believe Cities Skylines to be the spiritual successor."
assured_absence675,"After that, EA ruined the franchise. Even though it lacks some of the features of SC4, I believe Cities Skylines to be the spiritual successor."
Business-Cry-4679,Yet it's a shame the servers are dead. Not alot of players any more. They need to make some expansions maybe
danie_xci,"Too bad modder haven't been able to master de code, cause it would be easier if you could plop residential buildings"
,[deleted]
Ok_Web1962,"Uhhh..... I only know ""SimCity Buildit"" which is an android game. Is this a PC version or something? I want to know coz I already recognise some familiar buildings.."
13mpty,any game like this worth playing?
Warpedme,"Lol, I still prefer Sim City 2. By a large margin at that. Same goes for civilizations 2, which is still better than literally any game in the same genre.

Don't get me wrong I don't mean to bash other games in the city and civ building genre, some of them are definitely excellent runner ups that deserve a solid 3rd place after either of those games"
PaleontologistTop920,can u really make it this big(on the phone though)
