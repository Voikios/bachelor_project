Shnazzytwo,"They live in a information bubble that tells them to be angry and afraid all the time. They are told by that bubble that people committing violence are heroes. They are told by that bubble to never listen to anything outside the bubble. They are told anyone telling them they are not being good people should be ignored. They are told how smart they are to stay inside the bubble.

The problem is the right wing misinformation bubble."
Zero1030,Republicans would burn the country to the ground if only to rule the ashes

TheLuddy,What this guy did was absolutely psychotic. A poor child woke up to bullet holes in her room. Wtf is going on with the Republican party anymore? It's complete insanity
SockFullOfNickles,"The one thing Conservatives routinely do, is over estimate their own equity and numbers. They think they’re some “silent majority” when really they’re just a small group of loud assholes. They’re coming to grips with that now and it doesn’t appear that they’re taking it well."
gentlemancaller2000,"In 2016, Republicans took great delight in slamming Democrats as “snow flakes” because they were so upset at Trump’s win.  Oh the irony"
Thin_Skin_Jim,Terrorists gonna terrorize
CreepyWhistle,"I'm amused how they put the blame on the person alone as the term *""qualified candidate""*. Embraced, forgiven, and promoted until they lose (**Herschel Walker**) or finally jump the cliff (**Soloman Pena**). Suddenly it's a No True Scotsman situation.

>*If conservatives become convinced that they cannot win democratically, they will not abandon conservatism. They will reject democracy.*

Conservatives are inherently anti-democratic and want power to be held by a few. Capitalism and Feudalism are basically what conservatives want."
MrFlags69,“We won’t admit we’re unpopular so we’ll just shoot ya.”
bsmithi,most bullies refuse to admit that peacefully
_SpaceTimeContinuum,All of us need to be prepared to defend ourselves.  You never know when these nutcases will come after you or your family.  The fact that this guy was looking up people's addresses in public records to go harass them at home is incredibly terrifying.  He was gathering data for his planned murders.  He was casing people's homes.  Republicans are fucking mobsters.
LordSiravant,"This is a hallmark of malignant narcissism. The GOP is extremely attractive to this kind of power-hungry, violent-minded individual."
ghosttrainhobo,The GOP doesn’t care about popularity. They don’t care about people. They care about power.

Girlindaytona,No. They refuse to admit their deepest fear. That they are now a minority.
sgthulkarox,"Thanks to gerrymandering that no one wants to address, Republicans think they are popular."
LonelyAndroid11942,"A recurring theme among those of a conservative bent—especially those with a strong Christian affiliation—is a profound, violent fear of appearing to be wrong, and having your wrongness known. They will fight to keep knowledge of their wrongness contained, because unrighteousness is shameful and sinful."
Caymonki,Republicans are afraid of minorities. Republicans are the minority. Hrm. If only they knew..
raichu16,Can we please stop pretending these people are not nazis?

laffnlemming,They're much more than unpopular.
btbam666,"I've talked to many Republicans, a lot of them are scared of speaking out. The MAGA crowd has taken over the party. All the moderate Republicans are afraid of getting labeled a liberal. So they fall in line."

thelittleking,"""Like me or I'll kill you"" - Republicans and abusers"
zombiefied,"It’s worse than that.  This is history repaeating itself.  There was a campaign of intimidation, violence, and murder after the civil war that these acts are repeating.

We must as a society root this stupid shit out and punish these offenders with maximum sentences.  If we don’t it will keep happening."

ligh10ninglizard,"Thats what happens when you stack your party full of fascists, treasonous,  Russian  loving, Putin apologist, sex trafficking, vacations during a crisis, space lazer, lying, racist, billionaire pets  that dont know how to govern or make sensible policies that benefit the common American citizen."
Pointlessname123321,Scary to think what Lauren Boebert was dreaming of doing when she thought she had lost this last election. These guys are nuts
Therocknrolclown,They do not care about popularity. only subjugation.
Hagoromo-san,And they’ll continue to get even more violent.
ReadySetN0,And yet the GOP leaders and their media personalities continue to spew hate speech that tells their listeners that violence and murdering your political opponents is ok.
jviivii,Ronald Reagan turned mentally ill patients out into the streets rather than help them.
mistrowl,Republicans represent a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States and should be dealt with as such.
AHardCockToSuck,"If you want a glimpse into how republicans really want to be behind their lies, look to Iran and the Taliban"
HughDanforth,Call them what they are:  Violent Radical Republican Terrorists
PDXalreadtused,Republicans refuse to admit their “base” are turning into domestic terrorists because of their own language.
Astartes505,"Republicans are the party of being oppressed.  As untrue as their narrative is, they realize that they can only exist when there is a “war” on something i.e. Christmas, Families, American Values, Church, Freedom etc.  They use these things as fuel for self victimization so that they can garner support by gaslighting people into feeling like they are wrong for supporting things they don’t believe in. “What do you mean, you think X?!  You must obviously hate America.”  They constantly spout nonsense that people who don’t subscribe to their rhetoric are un-American and want to destroy the country.  Republicans NEED an enemy to justify their cruelty and greed.  So they make one. They pick a minority of some kind based on either Religion (Muslims a favorite), ethnicity (Black/Hispanics a favorite), or sexual orientation.  They spout hate and foster resentment amongst their base and use the first amendment as a shield against criticism, despite few realizing what it actually does in practice.  They use any action against them as ammunition to try and prove they are right and that they are waging war against evil.  This is not a strategy that is unique to the right but is more commonly used in their corner.  They think themselves clever and use slogans or quips to mask their hatred.  Lets go Brandon, the “Pat, I’d like to solve the puzzle…”, and “13%”, to name a few.  Then, when they run out of ideas they resort to ad hominem attacks.  /r/Conservative has plenty of examples.  Time and time again they prove themsleves to be more and more vile as the years progress.  They are the party of the individual, all the while seeking and advocating for removal of personal freedoms and liberties all in the guise of their flawed and corrupted morality.  If they decided that their slogan was “Fuck you, I’m gonna get mine.” it would better fit their mentality.  They are the kind of Christians their God didn’t want, the kind of Americans that smear our already tarnished reputation, and the sort of people who are so misguided they would actively vote against whats best for them purely because they have been brainwashed into a state of fear.  I can only hope they would see the hate for what it is and show the basic human decency I know they are capable of."
Initial-Pea-6834,Rightwingers do fascism. News at 11.
NarfledGarthak,"They're unpopular because they don't do a fucking thing for anyone.

* They don't support increasing minimum wage
* Don't support healthcare for everyone
* Don't support student loan forgiveness (which is a problem largely created by the government.  Nobody should pay 7-8% on government-backed loans)  
* They don't support education or giving teachers raises  
* They constantly blame shit on anything under the sun; gun violence must be because of music and video games
* They stick heir noses in other people's business and look to turn minority groups into 2nd-class citizens
* They are shamelessly full of shit and will lie without hesitation right to your face

They don't do anything for anyone.  No wonder they're not popular.  They are fucking worthless and they wrap all this nonsense up in the flag, call it ""freedom"", and their voters buy into it.  I don't even think you could have an honest and civilized debate with them any more.  First and foremost, they don't even have a fucking platform.  Secondly, if you could get one to sit down and actually try to argue the merits of any topic they'd just revert to dog-whistling and using dumb-ass phrases that don't mean anything.  ""Make America Great Again""....what the fuck does that even mean in a practical sense?

Republican Politicians are completely checked out, and their voters are sold on a mountain of bullshit.  It would be one thing if conservative voters could point to a couple of platform ideas that they like, but they can't because there is no platform."
BriskHeartedParadox,This can be solved if the average GOP voter would just consider the candidate presented to them. Truth is there isn’t a Conservative Party anymore. One party is clinging to the unspoken rules of old while the other has gone full criminal. 1 election cycle and it can be fixed
PeterTinkle,Christian extremists are Muslim extremists 2.0. Shit maybe even before Muslim extremism.
Hot_Eggplant_1306,"Refuse? No, they INTENTIONALLY don't care because they intend to seize and wield power indefinitely."
f0gax,They are terrorists and should be treated as such.
TemporaryConfusius,"Many Republican values and actions are a joke, if not dangerous and/or anti-democratic. I'm so sick of them. Then you find the ones that fantasize about killing Americans in their LARP civil war, where they finally get to *own the libs* for making fun of their daddy-god-emperor. Except no one is LARPing with them because no one wants to be a part of their little rage-fests. Fuck off Republicans."
TUGrad,"Honestly, this was evident long before now."

_Rooftop_Korean_,Yep. Some serious incel vibes
Major_Magazine8597,They're basically spoiled children with guns.
jizzlevania,Any person who has politely declined a Republican's mating/attention request is very familiar with their default to violence as the response for rejection
BearDen17,"Snowflake behavior, if you ask me."
Metal-Dog,This guy never should have even been a candidate.
whatisthesoulofaman,"Feature, not a bug."
Strat0BlasterX,They would sooner kill us all and burn the country to the ground than admit defeat.
Yookeroo,That’s because the GOP is a terrorist organization.
bcchuck,I think they can accept being unpopular. It’s admitting they are wrong they can’t accept.
SalsaBueno,This has been clearly obvious since the Oklahoma City Bombing. Why the fuck are we still acting like this is some newly discovered secret motivation?
Charming_Ganache_994,They’re the political version of school shooters

MasterpieceBrave420,"Conservatives are overgrown children terrified of that which they don't understand. Just like children, lacking any better ideas and still possessing the preconventional morality of toddlers, their only solution is violence."
awildhorsepenis,"They think we are all dumb enough to believe that this isn’t the real goal.

Anything they say otherwise discounts their actions time and again taken against the institutions of the United States.

The Republican party in its current guise is a front for a overthrowing the federal government, through force. 

their response? What about Joe Biden.

Nat C’s and traitors.

jchowdown,No popular policies since the 60s and they wonder why they have to cheat to win
Luder714,"I am 55.  Most of my friends are all at my age and middle right and we can agree to disagree.  I don't give a shit what your pronouns are and I don't give a shit which bathroom you use.  I also don't care if my kids marry someone the same sex or opposite sex, or what color they are.  I think unions are the last chance for workers in this country and people can take any drugs that they want and they should be able to graduate college debt free.  Just don't be a dick.

When my friends start freaking out about these talking points, I just ask them why they care.  Then they hear themselves talk and realize they really don't have a reason beyond what people tell them to think and they stop talking.  It doesn't change their minds, they just shut up about it.

Finally, my 85 yo mom who considers herself liberal because she doesn't go to church won't stop complaining because she heard about a girl who gets to pee in a litterbox at school because she identifies as a cat.

Honestly, 99% of the talking points on both sides are clearly stupid."
Certain-Ad-3840,Unpopular *and* wrong
mrbigglessworth,"I dont know exactly when this started but I can pinpoint when the rhetoric started and fermented shit like this.

It was when trump was asked if he would accept losing an election to Hillary in 2016 and even then, he left no room for a door opening to admit that he would possibly lose.  More like a ""we will see what I do""."
kvossera,Sounds like my abusive ex husband.
thepianoman456,"It’s like… what causes school shootings, but as an entire political party."
DustBunnyZoo,"This is what terrorism is classically defined as in every textbook.  Why then, is this not described as terrorism?  The GOP supports and promotes terrorism.  It’s a direct extension of Christian evangelical and fundamentalist tenets, which demand that people feel and experience the ""fear of God"" through the actions of their soldiers.  While this is part of conservatism as a whole (""the cruelty is the point""), it’s not unique to Christianity.  Political Islamism has been very open and honest about these tactics and they are fully documented.  When asked why Islamists attack unbelievers, they have said that they do so because unbelievers (or heretics of the same religion) must feel the fear of god to come back to the fold.  This is exactly what the GOP is doing.  They are attacking Democrats and so-called unbelievers in free market fundamentalism because it’s the only way they can appear to be strong.  The GOP has been very, very open about this.  Read what they and their followers said about Trump’s leadership style.  They supported Trump because he put the fear of god into the unbelievers.  They truly believe that a government must be led by a violent, aggressive, patriarchal, fear-inducing warlord—a description that coincidentally matches their Biblical conception of god.  Not only is nobody addressing the pink elephant in the room, but the J6 committee intentionally downplayed the role of Christian Nationalism in their report.  As long as our elected leaders continue to deny the problem, we will never solve it."

teyeyray,I am amazed  in that Republicans think the American people enjoy  loud mouth Karens  such as Bobbert and MTG!?  Not to mention an   racist businessman thief  GOP leader whom dyes his skin a  shade of orange?

Geeber_The_Drooler,"This is easily explained by their ignorance. And we all know that ""willful ignorance"" is stupidity.

youre-aliens,Congress people are national figures that impact national policy.  Many hold ironclad districts due to gerrymandering.  All politics are local and the reds very clearly cheat in local politics.
Nuka-World_Vacation,We need to go ahead and determine them a domestic terror threat. All of them. The politicians and their supporters are both a danger to civilization and human rights and safety. It's just madness to let their ideology be considered acceptable anywhere. They are hurting communities and people. They want to destroy any sort of future for people to grow up happy and healthy. It's just pure madness allowing them to exist as a legitimate political party and not the domestic terrorist threat they truly are.

But yes, they admit nothing."
