BoldFacedUsername,I know him. He is me
InvisibleZero420,Almost got the leg meta off.  If he didn't miss that last shot...and like the first three.
smegmathor,When 2 people who never check their mag or reload meet.
The-Chad-M14alt,meanwhile i get some gigachad french lvl 60 streamer with c5 armor lobbing 8 grenades at me when my scavbp is empty and my mosin is missing the front sight
mistafate,Yo I'm not gonna lie that dude would've probably smoked my ass. I have about 100-150hrs total in the game and yet have never killed another player. So don't worry everyone I'll take bottom teir player of the decade for y'all.
zyn1k3r,"""No matter how bad you are, someone is worse.""

My reason for coming back to Tarkov. The quest continues..."
killerallen0703,Of course I know the worst player he's me
dorekk,I wish I ran into either of y'all in my raids lmao.
Maximus-CZ,"When I see this I cringe,

And then I remember how more than once I ran with MP5, aimed, held down the trigger only to hear a single ""pew"", and wondered for a second why my gun aint firing more..."
Bean_man27,"This only reinforces my unhealthy habbit of incessant mag and chamber cheking during any bit of downtime because magazine catch go *click* and bolt go *shhinnk* respectively. 

I might get shot mid animation at some point but atleast when i get desync pre fired by a chad before i can even see him, it won't be due to lack of ammo that i died."
overwatchlap,"Ah, seems OP got invited to the secret LVNDMARK server."
Psychocide,No matter how bad you are the servers are worse.
te_monkey,Is that a challenge?
Raser43,That statement is how I win almost all of my pvp encounters.
Clitaurius,You are my spirit animal
ColeKatsilas,Thats just tarkov. You put hours into the game until the pool of people that suck more than you grows to an acceptable point
,Desync. Lag. Playing with a controller. Hard to say lol.
Bluetex110,Haha üòÇ love that reload üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Duke_of_the_URL,"This is my 4th wipe. In all of my wipes, my level > my PMC kills"
topsvop,tacticool non-meta gunbuild enjoyer
atlasthefirst,"where is shots 1-5 clearly missed
shots 6-9 are reasonable misses due to bad spray control??????"
shroombablol,this poor guy is me. everytime I try to get shotgun kills I do like 350dmg and then I die.
snoozieboi,"Early on I met a guy outside dorms, he was under a tree probably trying out figure some button mappings out. We spent what felt like a little eternity to try to kill each other, neither knew how to draw knife, horrible aim, probably ammo issues.

It was pre wipe, he eventually seemed to just lie down under a tree and I eventually got some ammo into my junk gun and ""won"". This was pre voip and weapon jams too. 

It was like when you see a real fight and people are just horrible at throwing punches, all quiet and just weird. At times it must have looked like when boxers just end up looking like they're hugging."
ffejOG,thanks i needed this
SnakeSkinBots,In my case drunker
UnusualDifference748,"Until you get to me, no one is worse than me yet here I am wipe number 5."
Never_argue_with_re,Damm is this me? Yesterday on woods I was pushing someone. Could easily killed him. But accidentally pressed fast run and scope aim on 5 meters. Could t manage to turn the laser on. Dead me. Stupid me
JollyReading8565,2 people running out of ammo in close range is what gives me the energy to keep playing this game. Such hilarious panic
knukeh,Lmao
No-Carry-7886,"I had this yesterday! I wasn't sure but I think the RMT hacker banwave had an effect.

I had what I would have sworn was a blind 6 year old or something fight me, they had a decked mp5 and I was a scav with a broken sniper. We had a battle at 2 meters and they refused to push me, just sat still while I peeked and shot them over and over, I won but bled out."
Sargash,Nooo! Using a salewa when you have the CAT hotkeyed
Bloody_Insane,Raise your hand if you thought the title was about you
gabymoka,That M4 is from the rogues right? Is it any good?
Euphoric_Service2540,But you can't expect Linus to show up in every game!!
Octopicake,"For me, I always hesitate because I've met a few players who were kind to me. One was cautionary but if they end up talking I generally assume they don't want any trouble. So when I see someone I pause too long trying to figure out if it's a scav or player. One player scared the shit out of me running right up at me with a shotgun and light but didn't shoot me immediately thankfully. That was a good run."
EpicGamingGuru,Could be worse. Your gun could jam at the start and hearing click click press button to fix jam.
wxmco,Honestly...average encounters right here
RancidRock,"This post would give me confidence but I'm still gear feared to fuck after like 6 wipes so I stand little chance, and this is after surviving FIFTEEN raids in a row in the first 2 days this wipe."
BIgBounceVEVO,"me with a shotgun every time, all the time"
belak444,We have all been there...
cptchrisrow,I‚Äôm that worse. Still I take pride in some of my bullets hitting even if I did die in seconds
Micotu,This is true except for that one guy.
TheBigZamboni85,Man is out here aiming with a touchpad
Scavwithaslick,Oh my god
Rossenator,Love that tactical reload
Xespool,They rarely meet though‚Ä¶.
Interesting_Muscle67,We talking about shotgun boy or the guy who panic reloaded when shotgun boy made him jump?
glossyplane245,‚ÄúNo matter how bad you are someone is worse‚Äù why can‚Äôt I ever be queued against that someone I just get instant tapped every time
Mightypeon-1Tapss,Amen
Mightypeon-1Tapss,"That guy is lagging either way, hardware or brain lag"
ImaginaryAI,"Heard this from a special forces trainer: ‚Äúreload when you feel like it, not when you have to‚Äù

Which means; have half a mag? Reload. Have 3/4‚Äôs a mag? Reload anyways. Then pack your mags"
Airin0_2,/u/savevideobot
hiddencamela,"Heh. I was this shot gun guy on shoreline with Copper Sabot.  
I lucked out that they other people were worse though. Free kits and 2 sets of nods.  
Not bad for a hobo shotgunner trying to do Spa tour."
Puzzled_Inflation_95,"U know lights shine threw walls 
So your just giving your self away with the light always on ."
Ummyeahthatscool69,Too bad I can‚Äôt run into anyone worse lol
JustMattLive_Twitch,"I think no one is actively good at tarkov we are all just extremely inconsistent  
like some games we can wipe a lobby not miss  
the next we get Head, eyes by a scav after spraying a full mag at him"
Trashfrog,You haven't seen me playing yet
ProfessorKrung,"""I swear, this never happens"""
M0usemeat,what is the key bind to heal your self ?
MajesticCat98,"Had that happen, a chad pushed me but he didn't have a mag in his gun lol"
lekzuz200,Luck
shroomdoom88,"We‚Äôre you trying to flip on your light? I accidentally do that all the time, reload when I‚Äôm trying to turn on my laser or light lmao"
RealTacticalTipToe,I also learned the hard way to check mag and fire rate as soon as im in
Couldntcarelesssss,I thought I check mag and chamber too much but I guess it‚Äôs a good thing
TheKillerSnail1,"I had an interaction where my duo partner and I came across a team of three in the woods map trying to loot. We tried to catch someone looting and get a free headshot kill, but couldn't. We moved up and I ended up getting a kill from above while one of theirs was moving up on my duo. I was hurt from one of their other teammates and healing/rehydrating. While one of their teammates came up from behind me. It was obvious it wasn't my duo by his very bright red armor. I'm not adept enough at the game to stop drinking pineapple, so I thought ""oh I'm dead for sure"". I looked at him, and he didn't shoot me. Probably, thinking we are a team. After finishing my refreshing pineapple, I lit him up for an easy kill. I bet to this day it haunts his dreams."
ledbottom,At any given moment someone is the worst Tarkov player playing.
chrisxtr3m3,that feels like me...on the receiving end of your barrel
lordnyrox,That first turn was smooth are you playing with a controller?
Yungterpintine,"Good thing you swung back to the left when you realized it was empty, caused him to over correct and miss some extra shots. Nice Recoveryüëçüèª"
RichHedge,oh my god
Cydocore,I respect that M4 build. Sadly we all know Tarkov prefers the version with a 60 inch barrel and somehow deems that better than these SBR tactical builds which are actually used in RL.
fatclownbaby,If putting a round in the chamber but forgetting to load a mag in my gun before raid was a profession I'd be CEO.
Enchantedmango1993,tarkov is one of the very few games that doesnt implement SBMM wich means you will always find someone worse or straight up dont know what im doing
Tirikemen,"I just grenaded myself on shoreline. Thought someone was in the weapon room (hep key) in power. Tried to toss a nade in the window, bounced back. Thought it was going further back so I ran forward. It hit the turbine and landed at my feet. And then I died."
xeeses226,I got killed in this exact spot and was getting flashbacks praying this wasn't a video of me.
wantonbobo,"""Im so sorry this never happens, you're just..... so geared I couldn't help it"""
ToughTry1287,I'm probably worst than both of you..
DarthSkath,That was entirely embarrassing
mcdouscherstein,Hmm PMC probably needed to cycle that weapon after that dry fire
rufioherpderp,I feel personally attacked.
WhichSeaworthiness49,You made a common mistake that gets many killed. Your opponent is playing on a potato
Rubber924,Challenge accepted and you're welcome for being worse than everyone else.
Any_Understanding424,The game is literally broken.
thehadgehawg,"Sometimes I forget that I'm actually good at tarkov üòÇ I feel like I'm doing so bad, but I have gear, money, I'm level 21, and I have ~70-100 pmc kills, 75% survival rate 11.4 kdr üòÖ I feel like these two players most days even tho I get 8-10 survives in a row x_x"
Bastard-of-the-North,Get good at pvp before you get good at looting
SteadyDJ516,The only time you win is when someone else makes a mistake
Snarker,What a funny reaction lol
Mr-Zahhak,"pictured, why gear determines who wins engagements

edit: before the troglodytes show up, guys firing crapshot from a shottie with 0 armour vs kitted m4 dude, 10/10 times op wins the engage and the fact he could when starting unloaded is all the proof you need"
NIGHTMAY3R-ttv,Both parties here suck.
