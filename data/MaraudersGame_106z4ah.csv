PolishedPebbles,"I tried submitting a support ticket to Team17, but when I tried to upload the video (trimmed it to 30 seconds and tried again as well), it gave me a connection error. Anyway, what are your thoughts on a match summary with names of who was in the game after you have either extracted or died (similar to Hunt:Showdown). I feel like this would at least help in these cases where I have no other information about who I encountered since I couldn't kill them."

bajungadustin,"Most of the time I can't tell if it's a hacker or I suck.

The other day I was sitting in a corner when this guy killed both of my team members and he started looting the bodies cause he didn't know I was there. I point blank aimed at his head from like 2 feet away and started shooting. He dropped menu turned and killed me in a split second. I had 170% accuracy. Still got ghosted."
YaBoyEvit,Why does your visor take up so much of the screen I couldn't even imagine lol
bzadaniel,I would have been scared shitless.
OverlordZombwich,"They appear to be doing it for awareness. But who knows.

There's TONS of hackers in this game. The only other game I could say is even remotely comparable is PUBG."
