chocobosocialclub,"Haha, congrats! I'm thinking of that meme with the guy standing alone in the corner at a party, thinking ""they don't even know I 100%d Mario 3D World"""
roofinruffin,"I can't believe I'm reading this. My two sons and I are working on 100%ing this very game now that they are both 11 and 12. We played tf out of it when they were 4 or 5, maybe 6 idk. Anyway we were stuck on Champion's Road when the younger one erased our save file on accident. I was so disappointed. We worked on it again for a while, but ultimately gave up. We literally just got back on it this week! The memories for me will forever be priceless.. Congratulations on your accomplishment!"
onlinepinky,"Great job, son! I'm proud of you!"
Nekomimi6x6,My husband and I attempted to 100% this game. Then we got to champions road... üòë. Let's just say we 99.9% it lol
ApatheticMuckraker,"As a fellow 100%er, congratulations! Who was your first character to beat Champions Road with? Mine was unexpectedly, Luigi."
Beateride,Congrats champion!
Celtic_Crown,I remember the absolute Hell that was trying to 100% NSBMW with my brothers. Congrats!
ThisMoneyIsNotForDon,I had a ton of fun doing this back on the Wii U almost 10 years ago now. Congrats
Afar3D,So that‚Äôs how all the stickers look like. Thank you!
Complete_Entry,"My dad would take a polaroid with both of us whenever we beat a game.

My uncle burned them, just to be a dick one day.

Congratulations, you are a Mario Master."
StarxStone,"Well there you go! Add a clip of Mario saying ""Thanks for playing my game"" and a splash screen of a cake and call it a W"
Efficient-Cupcake247,Nice job!
Danbuys,I have no idea what this means but congrats! üéâü•≥
Silhouettes5,Sheeeeeeesh what a gamer ü´°
mrespman,"Get better people in your life, my dude. Everyone should have someone that gives a fuck about the little things.

I, internet stranger, am proud of you. That game was a pain in the ass and a half to beat."
kronikheadband,Heck yeah! Something I could never do
sincethenes,"It‚Äôs a great feeling, isn‚Äôt it? I did it last year and I ran around the house shouting congratulatory expletives of joy like a madman. Only other gaming moment that difficult was the end of 3D Land."
elibou440,That is crazy cool I never manage to 100 % a mario game my closest is 96% on super Mario world on the snes
Captainhammer96,"Congrats! When I saw that screen I could only think about how I would never fill it up, I'm proud of you!"
Ch0ng0B0ng0,Wish Nintendo had achievements
Lew_is_a,Ring Ring.....Stamp collection!! Ha Ha
AleyahhhhK,Dang I hadn‚Äôt finished Champions road for years and just finished it recently. Satisfying asf and definitely my favourite Mario game of all time
jl_theprofessor,I'd never thought about 100%ing something until Mario Odyssey.
FallenRanger,I could never beat the final level. So hard.
publicbigguns,NICE! My wife and myself are doing the same thing right now.
thatweirdassdude,slay
Quaaid,I‚Äôm playing Mario 3D world with my daughter now and it‚Äôs one of the most amazing gaming experiences of my life.
RBFxJMH,"Did you do each level over and over as each character, a world at a time as each character, or the whole game as each character?"
keldy1221,The real challenge begins with Mario Paint. ü§£
BluntmanLegacy,"Dude, nice. I gave up on Champion's Road. I tried for 2 weeks and couldn't do it."
mechbasketmk3,Nice work!  I do care because I appreciate the dedication.  Most of the time I'm so busy that I get enough time to run through the story so I miss out of extra content.
thatonevideogamer,"Hell yeah, OP! Congrats!"
Harbingerofdeaf,Atta boy you‚Äôre a champion!
VacuouslyUntrue,"Amazing, I'm proud of you. I could never get so far."
Getoutofmylaboratory,Good job son.
ItzErCoCCo,This game is awesome. I've been playing it with a friend and we have too much fun
daskrip,Congratulations. You managed to beat the whole damn game.
SouthHopper,"I care! Well done, you're awesome."
Blind-GamerGirl,OK cool terrific
Sersch,Chapion's Road is Nightmare material. Hardest Mario level I've ever did.
mrgerrit,Currently on my way to 100% it. Love doing those things. Wish Nintendo had some kind trophy system so you have something to show for it.
levinyl,This is what I love about the Reddit community especially the gaming. My family and friends would think I was nuts if I told them the same thing as this... Where is here we all commend you
dubiousapproach,"I basically did everything you did except completing every level with every character. It was just... SO unnecesary in this game. Champion's road didn't take that long, since I have beaten it on an emulator before, so I knew the little tricks."
BloodlustyGummybear,Congrats!!! Gotta love those tasty 100%s
Sapphire_Sky_,Now check how many stars you got on the file select! Because you only get a five star file if you've touched the top of the flag pole in each level with each character
CelCylon5,"Yes, congrats! ü•Çüëè"
Pengtuzi,"It‚Äôs-a me, a proud stranger! Great job! ü§úü§õ"
mynameisyafet,Sweet! Me and my bro are playing it.
HanzoXHanzo,"Nice. That's a fun 100%. Some games are just super tedious, or way way too hard to the point that trying to 100% it literally makes you angry. But 3D World is just really fun to 100%. You gotta explore around to look for the stickers and the green stars. Good game."
PenguinSunday,"Oh my gods I'm so jelly! I get so frustrated so quickly and have to put it down :(

Great job, op!"
BJUmholtz,I can sense your pride and accomplishment.
Sega_Genitals,"My fianc√© was so into this game and got all the way to champions road and got so pissed we sold the whole WiiU and she has refused to touch another Mario game since. That was five years ago and the grudge is still strong, I just showed her this post and she just said ‚Äúthat was supposed to be me!‚Äù. Infinite respect bud, I‚Äôve seen what this game can do to a sane person."
cznoj,I absolutely flipped out when I finally got Champion's Road with everyone - congrats!
perlenbachersem,"https://www.speedrun.com/sm3dw/run/kz51xnjm

World record run with video

100% in 7h 24m 29s by Vallu"
VicAnderian,Congrats dude! Champions Road was a pain in the butt to do with all characters!
MoobooMagoo,"That's awesome, good job!

It's been a while since I played. You have to beat all the course with each character to get all the stamps, right? I finished all the levels but I only beat champion's road with one character. That level is hard as hell."
Jojo-Action,Congrats on champions road. I gave up after a few days. Rest of the game took me like 3 days max. Insane difficulty spike
PmMeBubbleButts,This is kick ass. Congrats!
Dani162002M,"Took me, my sister and 2 cousins a full day to get it done (Toad, Mario, Peach, Rosa), only needed Luigi now. And no kidding, I managed to do it 90% by myself on the very next try after beating it. Probably one of the best accomplishments in gaming for me as it was really fun 100% the game"
ZxJxkExZ,"i‚Äôve done this too, i used to grind with my brother but champions road burned him out. i was able to complete it after 5 weeks of trying"
wggn,Well done!
ArmaanAli04,Lmao. My brother got to champions road and just delete the game
Dacoldestdax,This game is cake until the end game collecting. Such a blast to play.
guy_with_wheelchair,result:5 furry stamps=YOU NEED HELP
syrindigo26,Right on brother! I did this on Wii U. Friggin love this game. I hope this style of Mario sticks around.
SrPolloFrito,Good job King or Queen. This is a badass accomplishment.
HauntedShores,Champion's Road had me wishing the entire game was like that. Everything up until then could be done blindfolded.
Munto-ZA,"Wow, congrats pal!"
SirCicero,"Hell yeah, I did it on the WiiU years and my wife and I are currently working through the switch version. Definitely an achievement!"
kjacobs03,"I‚Äôm nowhere near talented enough to beat that final level. I watched a video of someone doing it and they were doing moves I didn‚Äôt even know existed. 

Massive congrats on getting 100%!"
betadick99,Legend.
Cer3br0,My hero
tylenol3,"I‚Äôm not really a gamer, I don‚Äôt subscribe to this sub, and I‚Äôve not played this game. But I can completely relate to being extremely proud of something that absolutely no one in my life would understand. 

GREAT JOB! We‚Äôre all proud of you."
Tombinope,This is real life as well
Coccquaman,I'm proud of you.
pornplz22526,"Champion's Road took me eight hours to complete only once, after which I was able to knock it out with every character back-to-back. I was so afraid I'd lose my mojo at any moment!"
cerikstas,"I remember as a young kid I got Super Mario World. In the first ghost house I randomly found another exit which opened another path, and I was mesmerized.

When I 1y later 100pcted the game I got a feeling I remember now 30(?) years later, and I get nostalgic just thinking about it.

So....well done, hope you remember the happy feeling like I did!"
TheDoddRodd,"Well done! I'm still stuck on champions road, it's the only mainline Mario level I have yet to beat, I'll beat it one day!"
DarkerGames,"Congratulations! What an achievement! I never got to 100% a game ever, not even my ownüòÖ"
crazylazykitsune,Man I loved that level.  Granted I'm a bit of a masochist.  Which part was worse for you?  The part with the key coins was rage inducing for me.
Hilaxjun,"Me and a buddy working at an electronics store at the ass end of a crummy mall would take turns playing through this game when it was absolutely dead. It took us about 2 weeks to get to the last few levels. Those levels took us another 3 weeks to finally beat, the ending of that game is a bitch!"
Some-Broccoli3404,Congratulations!
Trimmball,Well done! That's pretty balla.
jparkhill,"If you did that on your own that is a real accomplishment, because you gotta beat that game essentially 5 times to 100 percent it. Well done that is a real grind game."
carretinha,You finished the game with all 5 characters? You are a real hero!
i_only_eat_nachos,Meeeeeyowww
Skintanium,"Well done. You deserve a rest, you've earned it!"
McDrakerson,"Bruh, I've been stuck on Champion's Road for *months*.

At least I'm having fun and spending quality time with my 6 year old, though."
PassablePizza1984,You‚Ä¶ you did it. You LEGEND. You done DID it.
saggy_crackhead_titz,My friends and I 100%d 3d world too. Took us about 2 months to do champions road and about a year and a half to complete everything
brandont04,"SM3DW > Super Mario Odyssey

I think open world Mario isn't that much fun VS linear stage designs."
alexasurfin,Champions road took me TWO YEARS. (Playing on and off) congrats.
Skullz64,"Good job, I played the game years ago, when I got the game with bowsers fury, I 100%ed everything on it, it felt good to be good at something 

Good job :)"
tcf167,"Dude, ur awesome! I hope to 100% that one too someday. Congratulations!"

pinkberry018,"Congratulations! 100%ing it from my experience was a lot of fun, it took me a whole day to beat champions road with all characters"
lod254,"Nice. I told my nephews if they 100% any game I buy them, I'll buy them a new game. 

So far, still no takers. I'd have been 100% ing a game a week as a kid for that deal."
macx1li,Smashed it!
_kingjoshh,Pepperidge Farm cares.

SethTurnstone,"Congratulations! That's an amazing accomplishment! I haven't played this, but Champions Road sound like the old Star Road on Super Mario World. I still remember how good it felt to get the 96*. It seems to me as if Mario games have gotten even more challenging, so kudos to you!"

My condolences for when a year goes by and you think ""yeah, I can do it again"" only to lose another week of your life. Dammit, it's a three day weekend and I can already hear my son wanting to play it again.

Of course I am looking forward it. The whole game is great."

OnlyMath,Had to to watch a video of that level just now. Uhhhh do you have to do that cleanly all in one go? That seems fucking wild.
netkcid,"Nice dude!!
I love me some 3D world... got 100% on the WiiU many many years ago."
DissatisfiedGamer,"Congrats bro, that's a certified accomplishment! Nice."
stang_thang26,Proud of you OP!
No_Palpitation_4712,Wow... how long did it take? Seriously it blows my mind that you dedicated time and effort. Congratulations.
kapeskerpar,i don't think ive seen a full sticker collection! nice work
YellowJello_OW,"I 100% it back on the Wii U, and it was one of the most satisfying feelings ever. It was such a good game"
TheKrytosVirus,"That's fantastic! I'm super close to doing this one too. After that, it's on to Bowser's Fury."
DonHarold,Good job!!
dethb0y,congrats!
jsweeze,Beautiful
rcdr_90,"Join the gang! 100%ing this was such a great adventure, I hope you had fun. Highly recommend all 100 cat shines in Bowser's Fury next :)"
flrbonihacwm-t-wm,The way I‚Äôm manifesting this for myself
normalreddituser3,"The worst part is doing it 5 times, took me more than double the time"
Flecco,My partner was doing this. Bravo you beautiful lunatic!
portobox1,"Congratulations!

This may age me a bit but I have fond memories of getting all 120 stars in Super Mario 64, and I remember how accomplished that made me feel.

I imagine that's a bit of what you're feeling now, and you've a welcoming group to raise a drink to the sky in spirit with you.

„Åä„ÇÅ„Åß„Å®„ÅÜ!!"
LearningIsTheBest,"I never played that game, but I got low-key frustrated just watching a YouTube video of someone else playing champion's road. That looks insane. Nice work."
shidored,The beauty of the internet. No one you know would care. But over 10 thousand strangers would. So awesome. Well done
somebodymakeitend,Very fun game
JustThatGuyBen,Such an incredible game. Congrats!
cavalupamortis,"That's fucking sick, OP! Way to go!"
Deadeye6646,Love to see it. Congratulations
Fyshtako,"Nice job, champion's road is tricky"
Perfect_Evidence,"That‚Äôs awesome.

I recently started playing this game and it‚Äôs awesome!"
Naman_Hegde,"congrats, I try to 100% most games I play and I completed this a few months back as well (without the extra character stickers, that require beating the whole game again). I don't really have anyone to show this stuff to as well so I can kinda relate."
cesclaveria,"Congratulations!

I was pretty close to finish it the year the game came out, sadly it was also the year I was teaching my nephew to play and he deleted my save, never went back to the game. He and his younger sister spent a lot of time trying to create a save for me back at that place and in the process now they are much better than me at Mario."
IIICaseIII,Nice!!! Congrats!!!!!!
AGranade,Did you have to beat every level once with every character? I remember seeing something like that and thinking well I can‚Äôt go back and do this 4 times
AstoriaGreenweed,I gave up and watched a play through of champions road to see how far I had to go. Seriously that's an amazing accomplishment. Congrats
Funcron,Congratulations! Good job!
JesusSaves822222,"Congrats! Now go watch the Dr Kent Hovind creation seminar asap! The ""Dinosaurs and the Bible"" video will astonish you and the ""lies in the textbooks"" might tick ya off a lil bit!!!"
--Imhighrightnow--,"I 100%‚Äôd Mario 64, Sunshine, Galaxy, Odyssey, and all the soulsborne games. 

I couldn‚Äôt beat Champions Road. You‚Äôre a god amongst men OP. Whenever you‚Äôre playing a game and you get beat down and want to quit, remember you‚Äôre the legend that made Champions Road your bitch. Godspeed my man"
WorkinName,Sick dude fuck yeah
NeoAmbitions,Man I'm glad this post blew up in r/gaming. SM3DW is such a great game.
booksthor,I've easily spend more time on champions road than the rest of the game put together
brimnac,Congrats! Thats dope.
carbonated_turtle,I've been playing through this on my Steam Deck recently and I had no idea what I was missing out on all these years. It's the perfect balance between 3D Mario games and sidescrollers.
Thorlynn,Congrats!
annonymousd,I have two levels of championship road left.  They are fucking difficult.  Hopefully someday I‚Äôll get them.
cr4fter003,"Props to you man. That game is a weird one, I hope I can finish it someday. Predicting Mario‚Äôs space in 3D is surprisingly hard."
FarAmphibian4236,"Tell them anyway! If they don't care then oh well, shouldn't prevent you from sharing your accomplishments:)"
Antmon666,"As a dad and a completionist, I say great job and I'm impressed.


I was proud when one child got first in a art exhibition or when they get A's or do well at sports.


But just between you and me


I was super proud when my kid 100% Spyro"
CapnOnTheBridge,Champions Road is nuts. Took me a lot of tries for sure.
Qav3l10n,Bold move! Truly astonishing!
jikla_93,Well done. I'm right behind you. Only a couple to go
Rhameolution,"Congratulations! This is a really big deal, so in turn it means you're a really big deal! 

Seriously, I play this game co-op with my kids and I carry the team usually. I cannot get the gold stars on the flag poles on some levels with them playing along with me, but by the time I get a chance to play alone I don't remember which character I've beaten each level with and on some levels it's a serious struggle to hit the top of the flagpole. 

It's enough to drive me crazy. Congrats again you patient, patient internet person!"
paulcosca,"I remember playing the first mario when I was five or six years old. And now my four-year-old daughter is completely obsessed with ""saving the fairies!"" in Super Mario 3D World. It really warms my heart to think that she'll remember our times playing together as her first real video game experience.

She's gone from not knowing how any of the controls work to completing most of the game by herself within a couple of months. I haven't had another place to share that, but it's really cool to see. :)"
CalmAmity,"I just did this yesterday as well!

Was it worth it having to beat Champion's Road five times? I say yes."
EfficientFlight2547,Congrats! Definite one of the toughest games I‚Äôve 100%‚Äôd. That and Spider-Man PS4.
zachariah_13,I have a shirt with the periodic table of super Mario printed on it
Zeebaeatah,I'm both impressed by and spooked by the cat suits.
XvXD34DP00LXvX,Congratulations champ!
Poptart21000,Congratulations!
iholli,"Oh that looks NICE, congrats! I'm still struggling to get through it all once because of the damn Piranhas After Dark level and cannot for the life of me figure out if I have to actually beat the level or get all the stars for it to count towards each sticker ?? Or I'm missing something. istg I am not smart enough for video games but I love them anyway. Huge props to you for this."
irxxis,Gratz bro. Big feels. Gj
Deytookerjerb,"Mad props, champions road took me weeks the first time. That‚Äôs with peach and items. I can‚Äôt imagine beating that level with Toad."
ICallEveryoneBabe,"We care mate.

But I feel ya. Doing a no hit run 100% on Cuphead and having all my friends go ‚Äúoh cool‚Äù hurts so much."
UnlikelyAlternative,"Oh, ok."
simopoulos_js,"congrats man,"
kudos75,Epic üòã
IntroductionCheap325,"One question though.

Wii U or Switch?"
Shadowthelogical,"I'm not doing that cuz for some ungodly reason, you're required to beat all the levels with all 5 characters, who came up with this??"
sw3aterCS,Hat‚Äôs off to you!
xstioph,A winner is you! ü´°
SomeoneNooneTomatoes,Nice job
Common-Violinist9290,Grats
cinlung,"If you make this into a deskmat, people would buy it. Perfect background color too."
bisforbenis,"I feel like this was a really fun game to 100%! And yeah, champions road with everyone is certainly an accomplishment!

Also this really reminds me how much I love the art style of these stickers and 3D World in general"
lloyd1024,"Still got that last level to do. Watched videos on how to do it, but just can‚Äôt beat it."
Inevitable-East-1386,Nice! Gz
ramenrehab,I haven't 100% completed a single game in my life
alfredzhx,Congrats. Just finished champion‚Äôs road. Trying to get the last five stamps atm.
mennydrives,"I fell in love with this game at launch. The first day I got it, I started playing at 9am after an 8pm-8am work shift.

At 11pm I realized that I should probably go to sleep and not die.

Got and beat Champion‚Äôs Road in what was likely my first week with the game. Worth every dime. I didn‚Äôt know about the warp zones for WEEKS."
Filon73,"The first time I did the Champion Road I used Mario because it just felt wrong to use a different character, it took a day..
Then when I had to use all the other characters I started with Luigi, it was WAAAAAAY EASIER, it took 7 tries.
With Peach it took 2 tries... Peach is just overpowered in the Champion Road.
Toad was hard, but once I took a Tanuki it was pretty easy.
Rosalina was a worse Peach, but she was overpowered anyway."
itchyd,"There are some skips in Champion's Road that make it a bit easier, check them out if you're at your frustration limit!"
tsuma534,As a lifetime Mario fan let me say that I'm proud of you.
