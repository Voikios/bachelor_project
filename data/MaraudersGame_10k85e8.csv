w1gster,"Honestly I get it, but people get way too tilted over getting killed in this game.  There will always be someone better or more geared out than you, and they will get the better of you most of the time.

Are there hackers in this game? Of course but they are extremely far and few between.  Most of the time it’s someone with very good map knowledge, aim and awareness.

I think the beauty of this game is that even though 80% of the time you’ll die to some chad, that 20% that you get the upper hand and take their stacked kit out of the raid the dopamine high is intoxicating.

Also the small maps and high headshot multiplier means you always have a chance against the chads even with rat gear, you just need to get gud."
Maybedeadbynow,Yeah...what about those hulks that run around corridors like Flash?! :/ Or the guys that fly around the space like on hyperspeed?! Same with their shooting speed
OverlordZombwich,Yet no one in the discord wants any changes.
VikingHokieWork,Would love to see a game that takes the streamers and only allows them in servers with other streamers. I would pay double for a game that I didn’t have to worry about the streamer sweats in
National_Divide_8970,There’s a glitch on Tera to get into walls in the middle and you can shoot through them and not be seen so I can see where you’re coming from
yeah_right_lag,"While I do agree with you on sus deaths, there are some really solid players out there. Best advice is to always go for headshots; you will almost always lose a gunfight to someone that is if you aren’t.

Hope you are enjoying the game!"
doeraymefa,"Tool kits aren't common? You are definitely not searching the right places lol. I had 20 tool kits by lvl 20 after prestiging.  Enough for 10 large crates, which I only need 6 of.

Map knowledge is key to success in this game"
Amaninthetrees,"Only experienced two in my 100ish hours. One was a clear speed hacker (light speed in a rustfuckit) and they got banned pretty quickly.

Other was a (now banned) leader board chud who was clearly using aim bot/walls."
domesystem,"I hit a dude with a termi dead on at five feet, he ate it and smoked me in lv14 armor near instantly."
