monkey_in_the_gloom,You crazy bastard you did it!
Bogey01,RIP computer...
wivaca,You should see the factory that makes and delivers the batteries for all these drones!
kionay,"Plenty of posts showcase trains and trucks, but I just love my network of drones too much.

Rubber to my main factory.  
Plastics to my main factory.  
2 ports of silica to a high speed connector factory.  
Those high speed connectors back down to my main factory.  
1 port to deliver batteries to other ports, and 4 ports to receive those batteries and distribute them to the other ports.  

It may not be efficient or energy-effective.   It may have throughput issues now or in the future.  
I'd still rather have all these drones than mess with trains. Also watching my swarm of drones is nice ðŸ™‚"

killcon13,Amazon wants to know your location.
YouMyron,Ikea
Separate-Reserve-786,"Never used drones, does this mean that you can just carry the parts for a Drone Port. Power storage and a couple biomass burners with fuel and you can essentially have anything delivered to you anywhere?   


I know it takes a lot of power for the port. I imagine you have the batteries worked out on the supply side so that wouldn't really be needed to be kept on hand, but I wonder if you pulse power into a remotely placed drone port (which is why I mentioned power storage) long enough to request the materials needed, if you would need power after that to actually retrieve the items... and even so if you could just pulse power into it again to retrieve them?"
Sgt_shinobi,Now to make a drone port just for exploring material replenishment.
raknor88,"Question about drones, do the docking ports act like truck stations or train stations when loading and unloading? Are they continuous or do they freeze?"
emkaboo,What an amazing maze.
thebobit,I gave up and started using teleport mod to go back to my central storage
Alphado-Jaki,"Me seeing explosive and ammo sign: Oh, great.

Me seeing concrete and iron plate sign: Oh shit."
UpstartBuckle09,Are there pics from different angles of the whole facility?
zayc_,Dear Mother of God...!
bastian74,Are each of those consuming 100MW?
