9192631770_Hz,"> McCarthy stripped Swalwell of his committee positions and called the California Democrat a “security threat” due to his link to a suspected Chinese spy.

But pay no attention to the *known* russian spy who infiltrated the nra and other high gop circles."
echoeco,Need some accountability laws here.  Threats are 'real' and should have consequences.
ellathefairy,The ability to rant against pedos in one breath and threaten to rape and kill specific children in the next  basically sums up the GQP at this point. SMH
Thetimmybaby,A GOP candidate just shot up a bunch of Democrats homes. This is not an isolated incident
Takemetothelevey,And they call themselves Godly 🤮
thistimelineisweird,"Democrats: ""Man we really hate Republicans we need to vote in more Democrats in next election.""

Republicans: ""We really hate Democrats, lets try and kill them.""

Both sides are not the same. But hey, Republicans, keep calling yourselves patriots, or something."
newnemo,"Fomenting violence has become the GOP go to it seems.  

>“People parrot what Kevin McCarthy is saying when they call and make the threat,” Swalwell told MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace on Wednesday’s broadcast of “Deadline: White House.”

.....

>Swalwell had told and “publicly broadcast” to McCarthy that his rhetoric “leads to threats to me, my wife, our kids,” he said to Wallace.

>“Recently someone said that they were going to rape and kill my children and they were using the language that Kevin McCarthy was using so there is a cost to this,” he added.

>But McCarthy “doesn’t care” and instead just “wants to focus on, you know, carrying out the vengeance that he has promised in this corrupt bargain,” he claimed, alleging McCarthy “won’t even stop and talk to me when I have tried to talk to him.”

Emotional-Coffee13,Considering the maga Qanon nut job in NM (allegedly) def did hire hit men to shoot 4 democrats cuz he lost w 26% of the vote (wtf voted for him)
rufotris,Interesting. So the people crying about pedophiles and groomers want to rape his children?! Why am I not surprised

yagonnawanna,He has the power to force a new speaker thanks to their own stupid rules. I'd say this would be a good reason as any
Old_Cheesecake_5481,"It’s the new normal. This is what happens when politicians seek power through whipping up hate.

Half of the US supports going in this direction strongly."
Jerk182,This country is under a very slow moving coup and something needs to be done about it before it really is too late. Laws are being broken and there's no DOJ protecting us. Corruption has taken over.
andorcornelius,Masturbation is a grievous sin because you are thinking about sinful thoughts about the other person. But threatening to rape and murder someone's family is apparently totally ok.

jarjarkinks4747,What the fuck is up with the GOP and r*ping kids? This party is fucking disgusting and needs to be disbanded.
M00n,"*McCarthy stripped Swalwell of his committee positions and called the California Democrat a “security threat” due to his link to a suspected Chinese spy. But Swalwell has never been implicated in any wrongdoing and the FBI has praised him for being “completely cooperative” with its investigation.* The right is pushing a lie about Swalwell being a spy for China. What happened was China infiltrated California politicians from 2011-2015. (8 years ago) Swalwell was just one of the people affected. When the FBI alerted Swalwell to the woman, he broke off all ties and cooperated with them."
BarelyHangingOn,"Imagine that, the Party of Pedophilia wants to rape his kids. Just another day in the life of a right wing christian."

snoopye12,Treat them all like the monsters and terrorists they are.
shez-bitchy,They're pro life so they can threaten children of people they hate
CW-OREILLY,Strange party.  Goes from openly stating: “castrate and kill all pedophiles” to “I’m gonna rape and kill your children”.  These people are unhinged.
sunplaysbass,What if - hear me out - laws applied to Republicans?
taez555,"I know I may be dating myself a little here, but I actually remember a time when people didn't threaten to rape and murder the children of politicians.    

Just like dreaming of getting the GI Joe Aircraft Carrier for Christmas, it's something today's kids will never understand."

Dauvin,Republicans being utter pieces of shit?  Must be a day ending in “-day”
YawaruSan,"Violent rhetoric inspires violence. Republicans can’t keep getting a pass or they’ll keep pushing the envelope, why wouldn’t they when it’s effective and they don’t suffer any consequences for the harm they cause? Liars won’t stop lying, they need to be called out and pushed back against until no one believes their lies anymore. If we can’t deal with ghouls like Santos (or w/e his real name is) we’ll never have a collective sense of sanity and order again."
Shavethatmonkey,The American Nazi Party has only violence and lies as a platform.
I_am_u_as_r_me,Politics has become a room of adults with toddlers threatening violence when they don’t get their way
Bhimtu,"McCarthy is drunk on power, and he's just the kind of small man to use that power like trump used it. McCarthy is a political terrorist, and doesn't deserve this job of Speaker because he's a small man, like Gingrich was before him. Small. Vindictive. Set on punishing the American People. Sucking up to trump.

McCarthy is a POS."
Beave1,"I'm all for free speech, but the fact that you need ""specific threats"" to bring any sort of suit against these people, especially public figures, is a joke. 

Trump, Hannity, and others go on endlessly spreading lies and telling people their ""way of life"" and ""values"" are under attack by liberals and specifically name peole like Swalwell and Pelosi. Then people make threats against those specifically named individuals, repeating almost verbatim the lies told by Trump, Hannity, and others. The link is clear. Spreading lies but claiming through your lawyers that they're just a little too vague to be legally accountable needs to be fixed. If Nancy Pelosi can prove that another public figure was telling lies about her in order to encourage violence, then there needs to be liability if it is reasonable to infer those lies led to someone else taking extreme action. Public figures need to be held to tighter account of the things they say about others because their words have influence. We loosen libel protections for public figures, but they should be given less leeway in things they say if it's reasonable their lies or comments can lead to violence or crimes by others.

A man beat Paul Pelosi with a hammer because people like Trump and Hannity spread lies and called for violence against Nancy. Saying ""someone should take her out"" and then claiming you didn't try to cause that outcome is nonsense. 

Free speech is to express viewpoints, not to try to get people to commit acts of violence or to spread lies about your political opponents.

Edits: Cleaned up poor grammar and added some detail to my thoughts."
KashmirRatCube,"Meanwhile, over on r/conservative they are mocking him and making all sorts of delusional accusations against him. And racist statements about Chinese people because they insist he is a CCP plant/agent/etc. We truly live in 2 different Americas."
kitzdeathrow,"The GOP base still believes that Swalwell had an affair with a Chinese spy. They get this idea from their political leaders and their rightwing propoganda outlets. Its all part of a smear campaign against Swalwell. The GOP saw he was a rising star and want to make sure he never holds a higher office.

Edit: For the record, [here is some good Axios reporting on this Chinese spy](https://www.axios.com/2020/12/08/china-spy-california-politicians). 

She did have sexual relationships with a couple of midwestern mayors. Thats the only sexual contacts we know about. 

FTA

>What happened: Amid a widening counterintelligence probe, federal investigators became so alarmed by Fang's behavior and activities that around 2015 they alerted Swalwell to their concerns — giving him what is known as a defensive briefing.

>-Swalwell immediately cut off all ties to Fang, according to a current U.S. intelligence official, and he has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

>-Fang left the country unexpectedly in mid-2015 amid the investigation. She did not respond to multiple attempts by Axios to reach her by email and Facebook."

green49285,"Repubs know this. This is why they repeat buzzwords over & over. Never forget prior to the Arizona governor being shot Sarah Palin put out a political ad that had fucking literal targets on a number of states, including Arizona."
zonitronic,It is beyond time to call out and punish lawmakers engaging in stochastic terrorism.
Responsible_Door3070,One loser GOP hired four individuals to shoot up Democratic lawmakers homes. Things like this is going to get real when MTG words get held against her. 🤬🤬🤬
harrid31,It’s past time to start charging people who do this. It’s no longer trolling once you turn your thoughts into threats. People like this belong behind bars.
ooouroboros,"It is disgusting that so many people voted for politicians who openly or covertly supported the attack on the capital and on our democracy.

There is a big and cancerous anti-ethics contingent in our society today"
OperativePiGuy,GOP supporters are proud to be transitioning to being regular old domestic terrorists. They deserve whatever bad things happen to them as a party/group.
FreshSatan,Republicans make everyone else look good by default

Extension-Extent3759,"We are doomed. Hate is powerful. Democracy, Medicare, Social Security, etc. all ending with GOP"
Dore81,And after what happened in New Mexico it’s time to take these threats for what they are. You can drop the domestic and just call them terrorists.
SenorBurns,"But be extra careful to avoid the ""Top Republican""'s name in the headline, no matter how awkwardly you have to word it."
cmgchamp2,"Repubs using threatening language leading to death and injury?   

No!  Never heard of such a thing, huh Repubs.   Huh Repubs?   Right Repubs?

Yo Repubs."
SpxUmadBroYolo,I always thought threats like this even online was an automatic knock on the door from the fbi or someone. I guess people can just get away with it easier than I thought.
beespleez,But wait!! Republicans aren't pedophiles!!?? Right!??????
ReadySetN0,"Violent far right factions are seeing the rhetoric being spewed by GOP leaders, right wing media, hell, even their evangelical preachers in some cases, as a call to arms and okaying violence against their political enemies.

They try to play off things like the Paul Gossar anime video that depicts him murdering AOC and Biden but the unhinged lunatics are seeing it as the, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, violence against your political enemies is just fine with us.

They know exactly what they are doing and as I've said many times, it's a feature, not a bug, of today's Republican party.

They fan the flames and encourage violence and then when it happens, they act shocked and claim zero responsibility.

Also, fuck the GOP, fascist pieces of shit."
Lemondrop1995,How can the GOP claim to be the party of family values when this is what some of their members are advocating. I'm aghast.
Jackpot777,"These abhorrent views are **mainstream right-wing** political opinions. This isn't some fringe. These aren't lone wolves. This is conservative ideology in the open.

Don't forget it. Don't let your guards down."
Yos13,Republicans are no longer a real political party and have not been for years.
Willing-Strawberry33,"Threats to rape should immediately put someone on a watch list, and threats to commit pedophilia should immediately get someone a restraining order from all schools and kid-friendly businesses. If you think it's okay to use your grungy dick to inspire fear in women and children, especially in this day and age, you are a monster. No debate."
cogitoergopwn,"Democrats have been civil, law-abiding, dweebs during this entire slow-moving Murdoch and Co. coup of stupid corruption. I cannot believe everyone is pretending republicans act in good faith when the entire R party is an existential threat to our country."
psuedospike,Jesus Christ Christian Repubicans are sick bastards!
Dudeist-Priest,It's amazing how common this is.  It happens all the way down to school boards.  It's funny how the crowd that claims to be family focused and god fearing loves to threaten people with the rape and murder.
,"No shit, they literally tried to take over the country and y’all just…. Let them continue running the country"
addled_and_old,"Honestly, I would simply light McCarthy up on the House floor every chance I got... make sure everyone knows how spineless and craven he is. Two years of that seems fair."
cosmicannoli,"Boy conservatives really love raping kids, don't they? Just saying, based on the evidence at hand. It seems to be the case."
mudkripple,I am stunned and yet never surprised at the capacity for people to say heinously evil things. I just cannot imagine hating anyone in the world enough to say this.
Automatic_Scholar686,Are there any democrats that are threatening violence or are there any radical democrat groups that promote violence of this level or at all?
Pour_Me_Another_,There's that huge list of republicans who are paedophiles.
AFuddyDuddy,The GQP should be labeled a terrorist group.
TUGrad,"Right-wing/GOP extremists are disturbingly obsessed w rape. There have been threats to rape Harris and other female politicians. Also, the people who planned to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer intended to rape and murder her. It's also ironic (and extremely disgusting) that them same people who claim to be protecting kids from ""grooming"" are threatening to rape someone's children."
christopherDdouglas,"Eric Swalwell has always seemed like a good guy, logical and prepared. GOP are domestic terrorists."
Alternative-Flan2869,Stop electing gqp thugs to congress and any public office until they find their moral compass.
Snoo6435,Swalwell should sue McCarthy's sorry ass.
Carlyz37,"Swalwell has been a target since traitortrump took office. He and Schiff were among the first to realize that Putin owns trump and that trump is a clear and present danger to America. Swalwell participated in and promoted the documentary ""Active Measures"" that covers the background history of Manafort, connection to Putin, Ukraine crimes and how trump was brought into it. Swalwell was very outspoken about traitortrump trashing the constitution the whole time trump was in office, he is part of a lawsuit against trump for the INSURRECTION. So Swalwell has been a maga terrorist target for all of this and McCarthy just put out a hit order on him with his lies about Swalwell and the FBI. McCarthy is a lying criminal traitor who should be in prison"
EthelMaePotterMertz,Kevin McCarthy is a creep
xxxxx420xxxxx,Inciting violence used to be a crime.....???? I'm not even sure anymore
xfactor6972,"Well MaCarthy  has turned in to a low class POS!
And the fucking psychopaths that follow Trump and the other low class POS house and Senate members have not problem with rape and death threats to their opponents wife’s and kids. #protectourchildren my ass!"
Narcissismkills,Could you imagine if moderates and liberals started threatening the GOP on such a large scale? They would freak out. They are provided with a sense of security because the people they demonize don't resort to violence at even close to the same levels as the GOP base.
riversroadsbridges,"Hi. I'm a left wing person who lives in a deep red area. If some of you blue folks with remote jobs could move out here and keep me company and help me muffle the fanatical right-wing echochamber that's developed in these decaying parts of the rust belt, that would be great. Please. Move out to the semi-rural Rust Belt 'burbs-- the subsuburbs-- and vote in the local elections. Send your kids and your family values to the local public schools and the local public library programs, which are both well-resourced  but in real danger of being forcefully decayed by elected Christofascists if the tide doesn't turn. You can buy a decent multi-bedroom house with a yard for under $100k. Internet is fast, and there's a choice of providers. The odds are good that your neighbors will believe in QAnon and have a basement full of guns, but we're only an hour from the city. It's a good life."

SurgeDad,It's only a matter of time before it happens.

esotericenema,"Never again.  Never again.  If this is ever over, never again.  Remember that."

F0MA,"The GOP has lost is GD mind. I say that as someone who voted conservative for my entire adult life. Granted, I always considered myself somewhere in the middle but I was registered Republican.

I miss the days where I could just hate both groups and kvetch about both of them equally. The radical direction the GOP is going is just not for me and that's too bad. We need a 2 party system (more than 2, actually).

We should all be unequivocally against threats like this  but the GOP stay silent or just fucking joke about it like they did with Paul Pelosi."
thebardbecoming,"So we can't just name the ""Top Republican""?"
mjayultra,These people deserve to be doxxed until the end of time
Cyber_Dan,Incitement is a crime.  Are these congresspeople immune?
Colt_Ocelot,Republicans are slowly becoming a terrorist organization
Infidel8,"GOP leaders like McCarthy are fully aware that their rhetoric puts Swalwell and many others in danger. It stopped being plausible long ago that these right-wing terror threats are just an unintended consequence of heated GOP rhetoric.

When are aware that your followers include volatile right wing terrorists -- like the ones who attacked the Capitol or plotted to kidnap a governor or sent pipe bombs to Trump's enemies -- then you know that your words are just accelerants on a flame.

These terror threats are not unintended, they are part of the GOP strategy."
beets_or_turnips,So weird that the headline TWICE describes but does not name Kevin Mccarthy.

classic_gamer82,"Sadly, there are too many Republicans who are either sociopaths or psychopaths to have prevented behavior like this from becoming normalized."
ERJAK123,"I think part of the issue is that the 'old guard' democrats still think the republicans are doing the standard 'dog and pony show' where both sides pretend to hate each other but are both secretly enriching themselves through kickbacks on highly pro-corporate policy.

What they don't realize is the NEW generation of republicans genuinely want them dead or in prison either because they believe it will let them grift EVEN HARDER or for 'jewish space laser' reasons."

No_Sentence289,Protect yourself..
smiama6,Time to replace Merrick Garland.
IcyBoysenberry9570,"This is a change.  It drives me crazy how much the Democrats act like their ""colleagues"" across the aisle aren't insane nazis.  If the Dems hadn't spent 40+ years acting like the Republicans were sane, we'd be living in a better world."
tmp04567,"Looks like the maga fringe are still terrorist trash. That kind of trespassers will be shot, and survivors executed."
RDO_Desmond,Hope Swalwell has filed a police report. His wife and children should sue McCarthy.

mlkybob,"I don't understand why Huffpost doesn't include what Kevin Mccarthy said. That would've been helpful.

I also find it absurd that this is tolerated, I imagine if this was my country, even if it wasn't possible to charge him with anything, that he would be impeached for simply being irresponsible with his speech."
