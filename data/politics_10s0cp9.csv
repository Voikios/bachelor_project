HSTsGhost-72,Republicans talk out both ends and it smells equally as shitty.
gearstars,"its just like everything, they dont actually believe in anything or have any sincerely held beliefs. they dont care about women, until they use them in discussing trans issues. they dont care about children, until they use them in abortion discussions. they dont care about the constitution, until they bring up the 2nd amendment... etc, etc.

the will just feign outrage over any topic that will get their base worked up but they have no consistency or substance"
Icy-Morning-4896,The Republican Party is turning into everything they tell their base they're fighting against. What a bunch of bitchy little hypocrites.
DustBunnyZoo,"How long is it going to take for people to realize we have a fully formed and functioning neo-Confederacy flush with cash from the oil industry and Christian Nationalists, who are focused on destroying democracy, rolling back civil rights, undermining the rule of law, and turning the US into an authoritarian surveillance state?"
epidemicsaints,Why keep focusing on this silly comment and Paul Gosar's anime video? Marj and Paul Gosar are both on committees and have both spoken at white nationalist conferences. Call it out for real.
zirky,"i mean, remember that time they were cool with the guys with torches screaming about jewish replacement?"
warfrogs,100% right.  MTG should be no where near *any* committee.  It's ridiculous.
PoptartMartt,Republicans do not belong in government at all
XueShiLong,"Nobody actually believes any of the GOP bullshit ""reasoning"". Republican politicians are posturing for power, the base sees it like entertainment, just another an episode of WWE."
Plainchant,"Hastily taking off his makeup, George Santos denied that he was responsible for the space lasers, apparently walking back his ""Jew-ish"" affiliation."
kbroaster,"Here's the thing, if Fox News doesn't tell them about it then they have no clue that it is even happening. 

A friend of mine who is all about Hunter Biden and his laptop, had no clue who George Santos was. Like no clue. This was last week. 

Talk about living in a bubble."
hulfordmon,The GOP has no credibility when it comes to statements - they are intentionally destroying democracy. The Dems are playing by the old rules
__M-E-O-W__,Or when a huge part of your demographic involves Neo nazis and other white supremacists.
N0T8g81n,AOC seems unaware of the GQP-KKK approved list of antisemitic tropes. Anything Jewish remotely related to Christian End Times is sacrosanct. Anything else remotely Jewish is fair game for criticism to calumny.
mdruckus,"We are on a steady train towards fascism. If you stand silent while books are banned, LGBTQ are hated, and black women are barred from House committees, then you are the problem."
Christ_votes_dem,r/murderedbyAOC
Cyber_Dan,"Republicans are a hate group.  People gotta start calling it out, none of this tap dancing around it.  Just...say...it.  They are a party that supports racism and bigotry and white superiority."
BirdLawyer50,This just in: everything the Republicans say is random nonsense to emptily advance what they want to do. There is no substance and they don’t give a shit if they get “called out” on it because getting called out results in literally zero consequences. Zero.
LavishnessAsleep8800,Her speech on the floor today was awesome.
DFu4ever,The GOP loves Israel but they hate the Jews.
Kaiser4567,She is the type of person I want to represent me in government. Regardless of whether I agree with her all the time it’s hard to say she doesnt have passion to make the US a better place.
NYArtFan1,"I loved seeing this. She was spitting fire. Frankly, we need a hell of a lot more of this kind of approach to the lies and fascism of the Republican party."
bt8zero,"I mean, no one will ever accuse republicans of being logical but it’s insulting that they pretend that there’s logic behind their actions. 

Like anyone with half a brain can see that the antisemitic party doesn’t care about condemning antisemitism but we’re supposed to believe that’s the case because they say so, despite dumbass Marg consistently rises in their ranks. Good on AOC for calling them out but since republican voters have less than half a brain, what’s clear to everyone else doesn’t really matter to them."
Protonbox22,"Who gives a shit they're not eligible to hold their positions legally after the insurrection. Idgaf about word duels we need fucking action against seditionists now! Sweeping action to deal with their existential threat.

Do your fucking jobs federal government."
BustaMoving,If Anti Semitism is the test every QAnon adherent in congress should be kicked off every committee.
Basaltmyers,I don’t see how anyone thinks republicans are actually out to do good.
ScarcityIcy8519,It’s Great to see the Democrats Stand Up to the republican bullies
PePeWaccabrada,"Jewish guy here, I can confirm we have space lasers aimed at the earth"
Exact_Purchase_7147,The GOP does not act in good faith. It’s time to move to the next step which is doing something about it other than pointing at it.
Alternative-Flan2869,"And benedict donald has lunch with infamous anti-Semite, ye, and white nationalist leader, disrespecting his daughter and son-in-law who are both Jewish."
TheWorldEnded,Country is a fucking embarrassment. I'm ashamed we're here.
Fluffy-Tomato-9972,"To me, as a Jewish person, it’s clear that the Republican representatives don’t give a shit about anti-Semitism."
SteakandTrach,"Damn, AOC, leave some snappy comebacks for the rest of us."
GaulzeGaul,"Has Ilhan Omar said anything about Judaism or Jews beyond the specific context of Israel? I think her outspokenness can sometimes be damaging to her political prospects, but is there even one thing she has said that is clearly antisemetic? Any of her critics care to explain?"
Karl2241,"She’s right. We need to get rid of all these racist politicians. There’s no room for racists in this country, such ideas fly in the face of what liberty and freedom stands for."
tosser1579,"[https://twitter.com/JustinGrayWSB/status/1354870334655262724/photo/1](https://twitter.com/JustinGrayWSB/status/1354870334655262724/photo/1)

Its sounds insane, but calling it Jewish Space Lasers is just the tip of the iceberg.  There is a lot to unpack there and all of it is incredibly stupid."
obiwankernobee,"Never forget or minimize the fact that when MTG brought up Jewish space lasers she was saying that there is a Jewish conspiracy TO ASSASSINATE SANTA CLAUS.  
I feel like not enough emphasis makes it past the first half of the statement."
stares_at_rain,"They used to conflate criticism of Israel with hatred of Jews and call both anti-Semitism. Now they've taken the next step: criticism of Israel is called anti-Semitism, while hatred of Jews is not."
TeamHope4,She's not wrong.
BobbleDick,"Why cant all other Dems be as fired up like that, like ever"
nate2etan,"The GOP are pathetic, racist, hypocrites and bullshit artist."
Scrimshawmud,"I’ve been listening to this podcast by the BBC called Nuremberg. I studied the holocaust in depth in college in the 90’s but this has reading of transcripts from some of the trials, and it’s intense. It’s also deeply disturbing how similar some of the language being used by the Nazis is to the Republican Party in America these days."
Sorcererslk,"Exactly. They just hate dems libs women of color and most of all people with strong moral
Comoass"
mike_bro,She's not wrong. Republicans are shameful.
ZeroCharistmas,Didn't they basically have to force MTG to acknowledge that the holocaust happened?
SomeNoteToMyself,"Yep! 

I’ve seen so many people defend the Republican party’s handling of Greene

Like, holly shit. The Republican Party never punished her and barely ever spoke ill of her. The only time a few GOP members criticised her was when they also voted to protect her.

They support Greene. They are represented by Greene"
Soggy_Midnight980,In case you were looking for proof that republicans don’t give a fuck about America.  <Rod Serling> Only in…The Twilight Zone.
AHidden1,I’m wondering how their voters vote for them. I’m just waiting for the other ball to drop when they finally cut Social Security and blame it on Democrats…
PutridTourist4,The Republican Party is turning into everything they tell their base they're fighting against. What a bunch of bitchy little hypocrites.
Cataphractoi,Ocasio Cortez is correct. The gop don't care about antisemitism beyond promoting it.
Abdi-1313,Republicans have been promising for years to remove Ilhan from the Foreign Affairs Committee since she first joined it. Because she is Muslim they actually  believe she is not loyal enough to America to sit in this important committee. this is purely anti Muslim action.
Massive_Horse_5720,Why should GOP condemn semitism? They're an openly fascist party.
Revgene1969,She screamed at the parents of mass shooting victims! That is on video. Wake up
PositivityCentral,Republicans and a bad faith argument? I mean…that’s literally what the party is built on
lilbebe50,I love AOC. She legit doesn’t give a fuck and calls them out on every single hypocrisy they spew.
sybersonic,"AOC claps back better than most of them.    

Whatever side, she's got a good sense of what's going on and staffers that are on point."
GBinAZ,I want to see Republicans’ response to this 1-minute speech by AOC that was 10x more inspiring than anything Kevin McCarthy has said in his tenure.
biskitheadburl,AOC and Omar both tell truth to power and power hates them for their honesty and integrity.
ProtonPi314,"But is Omar really antisemitic? Yes she did make negative comments against the Israeli government and some of their terrible actions throughout the years.  But I think most of what she said is quite fair.  She condemned the actions of many groups and governments. 

I'm against a lot of the actions that the US , Canadian and other various governments have committed over their history, does not mean I hate the whole race. 

Could she have chosen her words more carefully, probably. 

But when you compare what she says in contrast to the right, I would say it is pretty mild. 

I think an important question to ask is, is she making a difference in her role? This is how everyone in government should be judged, but sadly we just look at the R our the D, the right vs the left and ignore all else.

Edit to clarify government"
OrangeSlimeSoda,"And they refuse to oust a member who masqueraded as a descendent of Holocaust victims. 

AOC spitting straight fire once again."
Froststhethird,"And AOC's ""antisemitism"" was criticizing Israel for their actions in Palestine"
teriyakininja7,They also can’t seem to understand being anti-Israeli apartheid is not the same as being anti-Semitic. But can’t expect them to realize that given they don’t educate themselves.
Flaky_Seaweed_8979,Bro I fkn hate Republicans
2_Fives,"It was 100% because Ilhan is a strong independent black woman.

That scares the life out of the GOP because they know she has more of a spine than they ever will."
voltagenic,"The thing is that this wasn't about antisemitic comments.  That was just a convenient excuse to hide their obvious racism.

They felt it was incredibly irresponsible to have a Muslim on the foreign affairs committee, cuz you know, she's friends with Al Qaeda and ISIS just simply due to her religion and skin color.  They see it as 1+1=2 because they're a bunch of fucking idiots."
AiDueDeclaire,"I bet they laughed at these comments because they know how riduclous they, Republicans, are. They don't even care. AOC can make all the noise she wants. Republicans are getting exactly what they want so they literally don't give a shit. It's sad really. As long as power and money flows in their direction they'll happily keep taking the hits."
Mr-Cali,Didn’t MTG also said the holocaust was a hoax anyways? AOC isn’t wrong
dwarftosser77,"I disagree with AOC on a lot of things,  but you can't deny her wit.  This is awesome."
Downtown-Conclusion7,Obviously it’s bullshit. But to understand this logic you have to agree the GQP sees every issue as an isolated one. Patterns be ignored unless helpful to their opinions
Degen_up_North,"Republicans are hypocrites.

In other news water is wet."
cmgchamp2,Amen.
InevitableAvalanche,They really have no moral high ground anymore. Even if it was just an illusion before. They let the crazies in and now they are in control.
gaurddog,"I really don't get Jews who vote Republican at this point. 

How much do they have to court the Nazi and white supremacist vote before you realize low taxes and supporting Israel aren't enough?"
Wonderful_Delivery,Clowns all the way downtown while the GOP circus is around.
keplantgirl,I don’t want her near anything Jewish. Was she their best pick? The ‘Jewish space laser’ lady?
,Same old trick. Minorities always get blame for country's i issues
Mr_Mouthbreather,"To be fair to MTG, after she first started making all the antisemitic statements McConnell made her give a press conference to placate some of the donors. At the conference MTG let every one know she recently learned the Holocaust was real and she thought it was bad. So she's totally not a bigoted piece of shit anymore. /s"
stephenjr311,"I appreciate her calling out the BS. But it's all the low hanging fruit BS. She's got a platform because the Republicans have given her one by hating her so much, she should be using it to point out the other shit as well, the stuff that isn't just surface ""we're morons"" stuff. For instance and just something topical - how the Republicans have increased the debt more than Dems then won't agree to increase the debt ceiling when they can and Dem holds the WH. Or how Trumps tax cuts were permanent for the corps but expired for normal people to get it through.  Idk, maybe she does and those posts just don't get as much coverage. That also makes me sad lol."
SweetTea1000,GOP has spent the better part of the past decade refusing to condemn hate groups. They've no leg to stand on.
FappinPlatypus,"Other republicans need to start holding them accountable. If you want to vote Republican, fine, that’s your choice. Start standing up to your politicians who blatantly lie."
marvindanig,"Did anyone notice how Business Insider and general media continues to label AOC and her colleagues as the “squad,” but no labeling of the insurrectionists at large because they are whites."
Porp14,But having a Jewish Space Laser system is pro-Israel! /s
thenewcomputer,Nothing republicans do or say is in good faith. doesn't even matter if they're lying or not
Eisenhower-,"When AOC and MTG face each other in the presidential election, we will know that the end is near."
salawm,The only standards they have are double standards
uncriticalthinking,I don’t like AOC but she’s right
ReincarnatedInc,"I honestly dont know how AOC and others can stand to even be around these sick loons anymore. They walk into our congress while armed, spew nazi tropes, and spend all their time devising ways to hurt Americans and others."
Crash665,"Her whole speech/rebuttal/whathaveye was fire. She blasted them. She said they allowed the guy who threatened her with physical violence to get put on a committee, which is sickeningly true."
no-one-but-crow,"great speech from
AOC"
BubbaSpanks,"All of congress needs to be removed from office, not one of them is fit to fix this country a bunch of self serving idiots"
NativePhoenician,"AOC ain't wrong, regardless of what you otherwise think of her."
SoulingMyself,"For a fun time, watch how the media has to tap dance around how batshit insane Republicans are?"
wintremute,She ain't wrong
TinFoilBeanieTech,AIPAC needs to quit supporting these loons
kenkickr-790420,"It's to bad ALL politicians can't get over their egos and actually work together to make the lives of Americans better and focus on the real issues. Our countries ""democracy"" is a joke."
ResponsibilityNice51,She’s crazy but did she really mention the Jews or is this a “I can see Russia from my house” thing?
Kimchi_boy,"
Why the pic in her mask? Her speech was without,"
nenulenu,I wonder if there are any Jewish voters that voted Republican.
jtheotter,Well maybe do something about it then??
bcalnin,This energy right here. It’s about time!
geetmala,Didn’t the “Jewish Space Lasers” play CBGB?
PDXalreadtused,Republicans “we denounce antisemitism but the Jews are responsible for all our problems”.
E_seven_20,"The QOP excuse will suffice, as people will now debate ""both sides,"" which is just straight up total...horseshit. pretty tired of listening to them talk"
GMEN999,I am not sure what a red wave in 2022 would have been like. This is still pretty bad.
10-10--01-01,"AOC should have went with comparing vaccines to yellow stars, going with the billionaire space laser belief seems silly to those that don't pay attention to politics."
steveschoenberg,"AOC is clever and correct, but misses the point that GOPers don’t care if you point out their hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is the new sacrament of the right."
Temporary-Ad-9270,They don't call it a trailer park. ITS GLAMPING
wunwinglo,"The scariest part of this whole thing is that foreign country has effectively forbidden American citizens, who all enjoy constitutionally protected 1st amendment freedoms, from criticizing Israel irrespective of the reason. If it were China doing the same, people would be up in arms."
Salt_Laugh,It’s a shame that calling out hypocrisy will have no effort on this GOP. But it’s still worth doing! Never Yield!
RichKatz,Perfect.
Forsaken_Preference1,"Let’s be honest, AOC went in and was spot on."
GreatBoneStructure,AOC is awesome.   She's so cool she's almost Canadian.
HonorTheAllFather,"It's kinda wild how the GOP turned ""anti-Semitism"" from a phrase that mean 'anti-Jewish"" into one that means ""Doesn't blindly support the Israeli apartheid state."""
MelliffluousJ,"Dude!
This shit was savage!
I love AOC!
AOC for president!
Stick it to those racist assholes!"
FIiKFiiK,"Without speaking to specifics, referring to any criticism of anyone who adheres to the Jewish religion or the Israeli state as antisemitism does a disservice to the overall effort to snuff out actual antisemitism in our society. Jewish people act erroneously and Israel does evil. Saying those things is not antisemitic."
badass_panda,"As a Jew, can I politely point out that *both* Ilhan Omar and Margerie Taylor Greene have made a ton of antisemitic remarks?

I don't agree with removing Omar from her committee, and I'm a lifelong Democrat, but it does rub me the wrong way to have my people treated as pawns in all of this. Saying ""You guys are even more antisemitic,"" to the Republicans, while true, doesn't make me feel better about the fact that it's coming from both parties these days."
,And how is being critical of Israel being anti semitic? Israel has 100% done some horrible things. You can be unhappy with Israel and not hate Jewish people.
Andreas1120,It's the turban
ssoltis,"May I ask, what Omar said exactly that was ""antisemitic""? I tried looking it up and alot of the articles from a few years back from when this supposedly happened seem to shy away from the exact quote."
Tojo6619,Most of these Republicans should be prosecuted at this point wtf is going on
Alert_Section_6113,Republicans just want to be assholes…and they want it to be mandatory that everyone has to deal with them.
holidayrandy666,"Thank you, AOC."
davewhitebarber,Are we not supposed to talk about the jew lasers?
FckRed2474,AOC is amazing!
Silent_but-deadly,I don’t care.  Stop corporations from buying houses
PlzRetireMartinTyler,This is what the right wingers did in the UK. They used anti-Semitism to bring down a prominent left wing leader - Jeremy Corbyn.
CalmPanic402,I'm not taking advice from the party with a literal pedophile as their swing vote.
pomod,Democrats never realize that GOP hypocrisy and crazy culture wars are theatrical strategy - a bait and switch tactic to rile their neck beard constituents while simultaneously grifting them.
autotldr,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.businessinsider.com/aoc-republicans-ilhan-omar-anti-semitism-taylor-greene-jewish-space-lasers-2023-2) reduced by 81%. (I'm a bot)

asjfueflof,AOC may as well scream into the void. Anyone who cares already knows. She isn’t going to change anyone’s mind
Apprehensive_Sea_865,Neanderthal lady will say and do anything for power
Metal-Barcode,No one is allowed to criticize Israel whatsoever. Republican or democrat. This is the American way. Gotta stand up to your fellow tyrants.
Money_Butterscotch68,She doesn’t even believe 9/11.  Still won by 90%.  Tells you a lot.
