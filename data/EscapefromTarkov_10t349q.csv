toraw4,"I think sniper scavs are turned up, couple days ago I spawned near military base exit, sniper scav was already up and started shooting me in first couple seconds of spawning. I took a run towards power station, he was still shooting me through trees."
MyOpinionDiffers,Scav AI is bizzare in this game. I've had scavs run literally right past me even though I'm like 2 feet away and completely out in the open and they just ignore me. Then I've had scavs 1 tap me from a 100m with a fucking ak74u after shooting at them once. How hard is it to program believable AI?
FoxLP11,why is it so much worse this wipe? its weird... sniper scav in power will shoot all the way to resort on shoreline
renarddota,"The worst thing is hiding in a bush, shooting a scav with your sniper 100m away but missing the headshot, he turns around and immediately starts shooting at you.
How many times have you been shot at by another PMC hidden in a bush far away, turned around and saw exactly where he was ? The only way to see him would be thermal. Scavs however, will know instantly where you are."
Skytram,Had one on reserve shoot me point blank through a window at close range didn't make any sound at all.
Cuda14,"I quit playing because the sniper scavs were locked on and tracking me through Customs (same sniper scav)  - past textures, through terrain, etc. I tried going behind the hills in back and all. Lost big loot and quest items - just not in the mood to outplay aimlocking AI."
LegitKactus,"For clarification the scav was on the little watchtower sniper spot. I got shot at running into the cabin. This has nothing to do with my ""dark shadows""

Edit: the reason for the peek was to see if the scav had moved. I didnt think they could shoot me through the foliage that blocked the entire view"
Zojko,"Least pathetic developer, funny thing is this is intentional so that "" players team up to fight scavs """
Dyyrin,Never seen a company struggle so much with AI.
UnseriousSam,"Does anyone else feel like some scavs are very dangerous? And by that I mean only scavs at some specific locations. The sniper at checkpoint on customs as seen in the vid, the two scavs near the rock on the way to path to lighthouse on shoreline, the new scavs between old station and zb-016 on woods; there might be more but these specifically feel weird to me, like their accuracy/behavior is different."
ForwardToNowhere,No no it's okay we are small india game company and we fix this problem many time over the year
Thatoneirish,"Sadly when you get shot from that sniper scav in that area, the only thing you can reliably do is wait somewhere they can’t shoot you from for an honest minute to wait for them to deaggro and move- then reposition and pray it worked"
Upbeat-Chicken-2117,"I somehow aggro’d a scav at factory shacks/skeleton as I ran behind the green wall at the bus terminal, I proceeded towards 2 story I was almost at the bottom of the stairs and got my leg blacked, and had heavy bleed and a fracture, i crouched behind a tree to fix so I could run inside all the while shots were flying through the trees until I was dead.
Fucking unreal"
stuckInACallbackHell,Idk how they made this problem worse than it already was. It wasn’t this bad 3 wipes ago
Eisenmeower,just stop playing. its ok. the game sucks. I put in real effort to enjoy this game but it just gets worse as they continue to tailor it towards an 8hr/day streamer grind and ignore stupid mechanics that will never get fixed. there's a sea of awesome games out there. play those. that's what I did and I'll never go back. not sure why I'm even still subscribed to this sub lol.
Quirky_Koala,Styled on
MidiShiddy,They already fixed scavs being able to see through foliage. That scav just suppressed you and happened to hit you in the head. /s
ripinpeace12,"In b4 “skill issue,” “wear a face shield,” wear better armor”. Etc. because obviously we can’t criticize shitty AI design on this sub."
Puppy_Bot,just don't play the game
Ok_Calligrapher4955,I quit due to this problem
Invader-Tim-42,"Had that shit yesterday for like 3 times, not even sniperscavs, just drunk gopniks, 2 head eyed me from like 250-300m away, just one shot, peng dead like wtf, i could barely see them with my 6× scope, the second one was at night, looked like a pmc crazy thicc, but no just a drunk gopnik and 7.62, and the third one ( another night raid ) just lasered every bush in his way, took my mates round about 2 minutes to locate this turd, and of course he one shot head eyed another one out of the group

great experience, 10/10 would recommend this game to every casual cod gamer"
PizzaMaxEnjoyer,"i feel like scavs seeing too well at night/through foliage is an issue thats impossible to reliably fix because its not binary. with walls etc. the game can clearly say who can see who. but if a tree is in the way you will ""technically"" see some pixels of people behind it, and how can the game decide how many pixels are needed to ""see""  someone? its tough"
errorsniper,"This could have been said in .9 .10 .11 and .12

This is the game we are going to get."
SaiyanST,Skill issue /s
Dull_Scallion_6428,How you gonna see anything with dark as shadows like that
Sazbadashie,"So you are valid that shot was a little BS. But my question is why did you decide to peek it not once but twice when you probably knew he was nowhere close to you to take a shot. 

To make this into a lesson so you can be better next time is you probably should have just sprinted probably straight out the cabin towards the road where there is a bit more tree cover and hills for you to move up and kill the scav."
allajin,you might be shit at the game
LysergicAcidBath,"I've never understood this opinion,as frustrating as this is.

It's the scary truth of war.  Just because you can't see them, doesn't mean they can't see you. 

Irl it's pretty hard to see somebody hiding in a bush but a person hiding in a bush can see you clearly through the leaves"
FACEIT-InfinityG,im going to play devils advocate here. If you know it happens ( and i agree with you it sucks ) but why not adopt your game and play around it knowing it can happen?
jihadjoe94,"If you hear sanitar, run.
He does that through everything in existence and beyond. Fucking psycho. Hit me 7 times and it felt like one."
xylode,"I do agree scavs can be ridiculous I'm also sorry this was so frustrating for you. However, that is a sniper scav in that tower he is extra accurate and this wipe sniper scavs have been a bit more dangerous than previous. 

The way sniper scavs are right now you have to check there spot and kill then before they spot you or they will shoot at you till your dead. They don't seem to be losing aggro to well at the moment."
Shinyspoons,Me as an ARMA player: First time?
DasVulpen,I though they were simply better
PennyForYourQuarter,Happens dude. I went to zb014 on woods yesterday to extract. Heard a guy in there camping and tried to voip to him to see what was up. He didn’t make any noise so I decided to go just go outskirts. Ran upstairs and around the rock and boom. Completely silent firing squad of ai bushwookies puts me down. Must have been 3 of them but I couldn’t see a single one.
AnonymousAligator,Lmao its insane. Scavs should only be there to give away your position when you eventually fire back. Not one shotting head eyes through foliage 60m away change my mind
AverageMetalConsumer,Bag doesn't know how to balance their a.i. besides turning up their aim not.
Demgir,So I'm on the fence about this. I hate getting 1 tapped by a scav. Makes me actually fear them. But if you turn them down then honestly they are just fillers that pose no real threat. Same with rogues. No one thinks a rogue should tap you with a mounted gun 500 yards away. But if they couldn't then everyone would immediately load in and go for rogues and farm them by sniping all of them. People still do farm them but you still need to be extremely careful about it or they tap you with the red dot m4 from 400 yards. My favorite is dying to sanitar while he using a kedr from 300 yards..... I also don't know if it's true but I've been told the later the raid gets the deadlier the scavs become.
Thick-Highway8145,is it just me or did they buff scavs? I died 3 times so far this morning to scavs instantly head eyesing me or head-topping me 2-3 times IN A ROW the second I see them. Or maybe its just bad luck
808in503,"I've had sniper scav (powerplant) take shots at me all the up to resort! I was like wtf, through all the trees??"
Udontneedtoknow91,I’ve died probably 3x times more to regular scavs than to PMCs
ChefCobra," Scavs are way better then they were at the start of wipe, but there are still major extremes in their behaviour.

 You can run in in to complete dead brain scavs, that shoot like Troppers from Starwars. Or you run in to scavs/snipers that are more scary then Chad on cough medicine. If scav sees me first and right away starts blasting me with shotgun, I just run the hell out of there."
Partyhelmet,"Gluhar one tapped me through 4 rows of bushes, I hadn’t even drawn aggro"
Xerxis96,They even can see through shit like the tarps and boards over the windows at dorms in Customs. Got blasted by a reshala goon from across the courtyard through a surface specifically meant to block view from that window.
SAKilo1,Bro stands in a window and says shoots through trees like there’s not scav spawns outside the building
TheGreatWalk,"Yea their AI is bad, we know. They have a ton of problems.

Raiders and bosses are horrible, they can see you across maps and will instantly delete you before you ever have a chance to see them. There's no indication to know they are there until they kill you. Especially irritating because they can be impossible to see in some areas due to lighting and fog and often just stand still in a dark corner where you'd need esp to spot them. 

Server issues means sometimes AI voiceline don't play until they've already shot, so the first indicator you have you've even been spotted is head/eyes."
tyranski332,So this is why I got domed by a sniper scav the other day on customs. I couldn’t even see the rock yet and I was getting hit.
3sheetz,Is this ARMA3 now?
Shooter503,"I came to this thread thinking I was going to see someone dueling with a scav and trying to use a bush as cover and dying, but this is actually pretty fucked."
readysetzerg,The scavs who sits near the crates next to the village/path to shoreline are impossible to see through the foliage and shit and they just kill you 99% of the time. It's fuckin unreal how frustrating this is. That path is a death gauntlet.
Puzzled_Inflation_95,"How do u know he couldn't see u 
You know your best vantage points are ones you see the least out of because that means they can't see you.
If you peep threw a foot hole 
How you going to see me 100 years away 
U lucky to see the hole"
PingHangsLow,Ive never died to scavs so much this wipe haha
Budderdannish,Downvote me if you want but I appreciate the recent changes to AI this wipe.  I actually have to worry about EVERYTHING in raid (it's always been like this but even more substantial this wipe) and that's the way this game is meant to be played tbh. Fuck the gear fear just accept that gear comes and goes but your character lasts forever.  Best of luck in your future raids.
Dark_Lake_Genetics,"Thats the thing. I can literally toy with the MG rogues on light house. But lord forbid, I enter the 1st and 2nd floor crack house halls way thinking im safe to loot 😂"
Sufficient_Monk3427,That sounds like a personal problem. People that have been playing the game for a long time don't have issues with this and we also know that there are 2 scavs that roam in that area along with a sniper scav in the small watch tower.
OfficerCheeto,"It was that as long as they see you before running into or behind foliage they lock onto you unlike when going behind a wall or around a corner. Idk what its like now, but if you are originally undetected behind a tree or in a bush they shouldn't just auto lock on. I wish they gave them more ""investigate noise/brief sight of...."" functions."
Accomplished-Note386,Everyone complains about hackers but bsg put literal aim bots in the game
JuanezSanchez,I've been getting my shit rocked by scavs over and over so don't feel too bad
rasmorak,I just got TOZ'd from about 80 meters away through the trees and brush by a scav on woods.
Bonus-Representative,It does piss me off when you cannot see them.
Sinikal_,"""It NeVeR hApPeNs. SkIlL iSsUe."""
Interesting-Bee-124,I feel like if they see you go into the foliage then it’s for obvious reasons ok and expected
ineverpoopedmyselfb4,"bad peak, skill issue"
Shadowkrieger7,welcome to BSG logic.
Opressivesingularity,They should do what rust recently did and make it so they stop shooting when they lose LOS
BLUEWOLFOX666,u/savevideobot
dreadknot65,"Probs sniper scav. This dude and I were in a sniping war on shoreline during a night raid. I was in gas station, shooting through the little window. Everytime I peaked a different angle and everytime he either hit me or got damn close. I only got him because of good ammo and a thorax shot. Customs I've had sniper scav shoot me from dorms to crackhouse."
ZeroUnits,Bro this game is fucked rn I'm on the verge of uninstalling it honestly
szzaass,The Military experience scavs have include iris augmentation with thermal sensors
Stock-Chemist6872,"Yup in final game you will have perma death effects... GG broken netcode, broken AI and they want to implement bs like that and they still think it's a good idea and a lot of people are going to play it after :D"
Mission_Moment2561,"First off, no hate, I agree, it's very dumb. Next, how often has this sort of thing happened to ppl? I've seen so many posts about this type of stuff but I feel like when I end up in a situation like this 95% of the time they stop shooting too. What's everyone else's experience?"
hughie1987,"I wish they'd actually adjust how people look at range, scavs at 50byards don't look like it at all and further etc"
Dependent-Mission714,I think its a double edged sword. If they cant do that they are too easy mode. U just setup and quick peek em. Ridiculously even i like how the scavs get you nervous cause could be crack could be not
Dependent-Mission714,Just dont get why you want scavs to be knee capped and made to be easy af do yall not like the thrill of the unkniwn if that scav is on a headshot streak or not?. Id rather not fight zombies...
FupasMaximus,your post fx are absolute dog shit no wonder you can’t see them
Electrical_Case_965,Then start running
ConsiderationLive258,I got head eyes'd by a 9mm vector scav on top of power station in shoreline today. Took a small break after that. 2 bursts was all it took
HellsFrogs,They should be able to. If you can do it they can do it.
Alterragen,Through walls and hard cover too.
Atrixia,RUAF is a deathtrap
Swiftrists,Bro how you gonna post this when you play like an AI yourself
stelkurtainTM,Skill issue
whizkey7,"Dogshit game, scav killed me on customs through like 2 fucking cars and foliage you couldn't even shoot him back he just destroys you at any range, through anything unless its a literal wall. So discouraging, and he wasn't even a sniper scav. Never have I seen a worse tuned AI in my fucking life."
