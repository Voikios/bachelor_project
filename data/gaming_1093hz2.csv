DooglarRampant,"What the hell is, ""Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier""?!"
CaptainR3x,How does one feel when you can’t play a game you spent hundreds of $$$ on
mrfroggyman,"Pro tip : stop releasing mobile only games when that's not where your fan base is...

And not for a fucking BR for crying out loud

And especially not when the genre has never been explored for your licence holy shit

That was such a dumb combination of dumb choices"
Zeroth_Breaker,"I tried to play this game. Had hundreds of hours in CoD: Mobile's BR mode, and wanted something new. This game seemed like it.

Except... It was not really that good. Gun mechanics felt weird, the spells were interesting but broke combat too much.

I could have stomached these things up to a point, but the deal breaker was the battle pass: 100 tiers, slow progression. It's a console battlepass in a mobile game (CoD Mobile's is only 50 tiers and can be done fairly quickly if you are dedicated to the game).

I think a game with this concept of classes, spells and guns can work, but the execution here was not it."
HighDegree,Nice of them to put the lifetime player base in the goodbye picture.
LumpyBastion420,"The problem these types of games have is the same one MMORPGs had back in the day. One or two major games hog all the players.

With single-player games the same person can buy and play different games, but a multi-player game is a commitment especially these days."
Lastaria,Wait…what? I had not even heard of 5his game.
Ace_Dreamer,The ***WHAT?***
MonteBellmond,That was fast lmao
Professional-Paper75,It wasn’t a bad game by any stretch. Just killed itself by overfilling the micro transaction space with too many currency types all at once.
Ganondorf_Dragomir,How many games did Square Enix shut down recently?
Scavenge101,It wasn't even a bad idea.  Just...why on fucking mobile?
htoirax,"So I'm not sure who this game was for.

The west doesn't like mobile games at all, but Japan absolutely loves them.  
The west loves BR games, but I'm not sure Japan does?"
n00bprogrammerx,I don't even know who you are
Haxteal,"Tbh, if this was on PC or Console, I would have played it"
SuburbanHell,Another great choice by the executives at Square Enix.
SpiderPidge,I want a statue of a Cactuar saluting now
bob101910,"Didn't run well on my old phone. Just got a new phone for Christmas that can run it. Found out it was shutting down, so didn't even bother. Seemed like an interesting idea instead of another gacha"
Giotaku,This is why I hate liveservice. They ruin good games. Game was solid to  be honest. Why shut it down? Just let people play with bots for all I care. Put a pricetag on the game. Square Enix is becoming the next EA.
IIIdeletedIII,"Wish I’d known this existed. I may have played it.

Lemme guess no console or pc release?"
Dragoninstall,"It was okay, but not enough to continue playing it for extended periods of time. I understand why they do what they do, but I can't help but feel like you would have made much more moolah releasing this on console. I probably would have spent money playing it on a platform I felt comfortable on."
deathbunnyy,and nothing of value was lost
Dry_Violinist6495,Why did this exist
lizard81288,"Square Enix: Hey, want to try another live service by us?.... Don't look at the 3 games we closed down within a year of their life span... I bet you want to buy some premium gems from us!..."
Xirias,It’s great that they were able to fit the whole player base in this commemorative screenshot.
Cerberus-Coco-Mimi,this wah happens when you try to follow trends instead of set the
Ratchet83,"Square enix keeping alive a live service game more than a year challenge

Level : Impossible"
Pliskkenn_D,Should have released it on PC yadda yadda
Roachester,Did anyone actually expect this game to last?
JuliusKingsleyXIII,"How long was this even live for? I barely knew it launched at all, first I heard of it was that it was shutting down."
cjjones07,"New this wasn't gonna last long the moment it was announced. the game was just late to the genre and out of taste from Square enix. 

stick to your lane"
Dynamaxxed,"As an every day gamer who is in love with all things FF.....I have never once heard of this game.  

I can't imagine there's going to be a lot of people devastated by this"
GLDFLCN,TIL there’s yet another FF VII game I didn’t know was released
BroForceOne,"Because when I think of a great game for fans of story-driven JRPGs, its a competitive battle royale shooter..."
VitalizedMango,"Incredible seeing the difference between this game, which was made mobile-only for some insane reason and then abandoned after like a year, to Yoshida rescuing and rebuilding FFXIV.

Swear to God if he'd been hired by Sega or Nintendo or something, Square-Enix would not exist right now, it'd be a branch of Microsoft"
NewBobPow,I fucking hate how these game companies just make these games disposable.  Why can't they just let these games be playable forever?  At least let people host their own servers.
MrKajimon,Imagine paying for this game just to see it closed
ExhibitionistBrit,And this was the first time I’ve ever heard of this game…
StriderLee33,They really managed to fit the whole player base in one photo.
BritishUnicorn69,Never heard of this before until now
kobocha,"Who?

Oh I see. A shitty ”free2play” mobile shooter that tries to hone in on some easy fanbase cash by making another shitty fucking battleroyale for an IP that has ZERO connections to shooters. 

Dont worry ill take my pills now."
Tac0Destroyer,The people shown in the screenshot are the actual remaining players left playing. Probably.
adamhanson,The what now?
Well_this_is_akward,Lol and I've still been toying with the idea of downloading it. Guess not then haha
RaymondMasseyXbox,Next up for closure Babylons Fall and Chocobo GP.
A_N_T,I'm sure all 6 players are devastated right now.
FF7REMAKE,"I didn't hate this game, just a shame they couldn't get the technical issues worked out completely. I'd play on a S10+ with a dualshock4 and it was mostly really good, but it would glitch during big team fights.  Sniping headshots from super far away was as satisfying as any videogame, and I loved going to all the different locations of Midgar in this game like the Honey Bee Inn, and the Church. It had it's fair share of issues, among them being mobile exclusive, that if were released for free and worked on consoles I think it would have had the required amount of minimum players to keep going for longer. I'd seriously expected them to get more and more maps with each release of FF7R series.

Also this game granted me IRL Soldier 1st Class status, I'm gonna try to keep the screenshot of that certificate my whole life lol."
mixed_super_man_81,"Good, maybe square will make games their fans actually want instead trying to emulate Fortnite."
curtain_swoosh,"they should have made it for consoles, and not shit mobile."
RookSalvis,"I know so many people who’d have been interested in trying this game out if it just…ya know; wasn’t on mobile?

Why was this never ported to pc?"
its_5oclock_sumwhere,"Never knew this game existed. 

Okay, I guess. Bye?"
MyFriendsCallMeTito,Today I learned that Final Fantasy VII: First Soldier existed
papercup617,"I actually think a FF battle royale game could be pretty neat but just FF7 and just mobile, and free to play, it was asking to get shut down."
AdminH8ter,Who's soul is gonna get stuck in the game?
Zellough,WHEN DID IT LAUNCH LMFAO
UncleRichardson,Probably would've done alright if it wasn't mobile only. But such is FF spin off games.
RevolTobor,... well *that* didn't last long O\_O
OffbeatBlitz,"Breaks my heart. Idk how many of y'all played this but it was a genuinely fun idea held back by shitty management. if this game was on PC or at LEAST emulatable (they took great strides to make sure it wasn't), it would have been a daily play type of game for me. I enjoyed it up til the mobile aspects started to really wear me down. Tragically mishandled."
i010011010,"Good riddance.

But today, we aren't so much saying _goodbye_ to one cash grabbing scam that leverages the goodwill from a decades-old series into shameless vampiric freemium bullshit; we're saying _hello_ to the dozen more that will take its place."
Whole-One5205,Bro this game was actually fire
PalpitationNo4375,"That didn't last very long now did it.

It's almost as if FF fans play console and PC where available. And almost as if BR fans play mostly PC with a fair amount on console."
XeroHour520,"I played a decent amount of this. It was a fun game that was completely and totally shackled by being mobile only.

I think it would have done fine on console and/or pc."
raihidara,Thank you everyone else for not playing and shutting this soulless cashgrab down.
SweetDank,"I'm a massive Final Fantasy fan and 7 is in my tie for top-3 best FFs...I'm on the internet all day (for work lol) and am gaming a couple hours every evening...I NEVER KNEW THIS WAS A THING!

If that company isn't even trying to target one of their biggest FF7 fans, there's no way it could succeed."
Windyandbreezy,Well that lasted long..
Slurm818,Wtf game is this lol
xariznightmare2908,I didn't even know this game was even a thing.
RoyalCrown-cola,Not gonna lie I would enjoy a 1st/3rd person shooter rpg Final Fantasy game but a mobile only battle royal game isn't really it.
DonCorneos,"Lol, what? 

When did it even open?"
JasonVanJason,"The game was not great, the materia was kind of neat, this would of been great had it been attached to ff remake, using different systems than remake was a dumb choice"
Eddiejay30,I never got to play. The updates and initial install took waaay too long and when my phone slept it would start over. They killed this game off fast.
drakesylvan,Good riddance to more mobile games.
theallaroundnerd,And nothing of value was lost
Time2kill,"It was actually a fun game, just need better balancing and opening for pc/consoles. Riding Chocobo with your team around the map and using a summon during the final fight was actually quite awesome."
SubmissiveDinosaur,Lasted too much
TheFinalBoss90,I actually enjoyed this game and it's unique twist on a battle royal. It kinda sucks seeing all these people bash on the game while making inaccurate assumptions along with most likely never having even played it. It was not advertised nearly enough and many didn't even know of its existence. I feel if there was even the slightest bit of effort towards marketing I feel like more people would have tried it out simply bc it is a final fantasy game. I'm sad to see it go and also am not surprised
Narkanin,Had potential. Mistake not releasing it for consoles/pc and putting some effort into it.
QuitFrozenTurkey,"You can tell they put a lot of money into advertising it, because this is the first time I've heard of it. Great."
abrachoo,"If a game can ""close down"" such that it can not be played anymore, it never deserved to be played to begin with. Terrible design choice, 0/10."
supermario182,I would've played it more on console or PC.
geven87,"Goodbye, Pickle Rick!"
The_L3G10N,I honestly really enjoyed it when I tried it. But playing on mobile is just a no for me
mame_kuma,The game was... fine. Janky and full of bots/children and it crashed all the fucking time but gameplay wise it wasn't awful. Pair a controller and it was enough to pass the time on a slow work day.
tofulo,I legit didn’t know this released
tzeriel,Another turd flushed. Shame it took this long.
degoogleyourphone,Idk what this is but sad to see a game go
InfiniteTumbleweed77,I actually really enjoyed this game. The first 20 minutes of each match was bots running at you and killing them followed by meeting the only other live player in the game for a heated 1v1 to win or lose the match.
bdhoff,"To those affected, you have my sympathies. Been there. It sucks. Makes me not want to spend money on mobile games."
highonpixels,Feel like Square Enix went late on the trends and threw money at live service projects with disregard to quality. This and Babylon Falls the sole examples. They should take a note from Bandai Namco as I feel both of them were at some stage heavily invested in Mobile cash cow games however Bandai seemed to have reinvested much more wisely and producing hits. With Square Enix selling off studios its like they just hanging on the Final Fantasy franchise. Forspoken looks really soso and the latest trailer didn't pique my interest further.
Mantaur4HOF,"""So long and thanks for all the cash!"""
kyoki2121,I didn’t play. You’re welcome.
RatedR2O,I would've played more of it because I'm a huge FF7 fan... but I don't like mobile games.
FamiGami,"With all these closures, how can Square Enix ever expect ANYONE to ever sign up for any game service they ever release going forward? They're worse than Netflix when it comes to commitment!"
Tacowant,Would have loved to try…except it was on freaking mobile.  I can’t stand mobile gaming personally.
depressed_sans,"It wasn't a good game but it was a fun game, rest in bytes buddy"
SpikeRosered,"The turnaround of these failed licensed mobile games is scary.

I'm a bit reminded of the FF15 tie in pinball mobile game that only lasted a few months before dying. It was weird because the game was released in an incomplete state and literally never given the resources to be finished.

The in-game pinball game wasn't very engaging either imo. It was a weird thing to focus on for the live-service experiment that was FF15."
DeadHED,I never even heard of this
,I didn't even know this game existed
WillSmithsper,Had no idea this game even came out.
frogparlor,I played this game every day since a few weeks after lunch. AMA
Shadw21,I've never heard of this game.
SirBastian1129,Oh no.... anyway.
geocitiesuser,"Never heard of it, tbqh. Mobile game I'm thinking?"
Cleveland_Guardians,I'm guessing that's a picture of everyone who ever played it?
MedonSirius,Lol that's the peak of the playerbase in summary in one picture
pacman404,"Lol I don't even know what this is, and I'm a huge final fantasy fan 🤔"
MWIIesDoggyCOPE,Fucking mobileshit. TFS would've been GOATed on consoles and PC
EverquestJunky,Imagine playing these mobile shitters omegalul
kdebones,Aka “thank you for wasting your money.”
JodAetaem,"Played 5 games, won one , call it a day. 
I love FF7 like everyone else, but it was not a great game. Sorry for the few people who whaled it !"
TW1TCHYGAM3R,"Not releasing this for console is probably what killed this game.

It was OK as far as BR go but I would have preferred more Melee/Sword/Magic fighting than mostly guns for a FF game."
0tawizo,Boo hoo let me press f on the world’s smallest keyboard
Houeclipse,Psp graphic looking ass
ChaosMiles07,"""I will never be a memory...""

_\*instantly forgotten\*_

So anyways, _Ever Crisis_ next, huh? Anyone?"
SirLocke13,And nothing of value was lost.
concequence,"Is... that Wol in the middle there in the Trenchcoat?

edit: Also all the Mobius players:  ""First time?"""
Darksawyerx,thank god i hate that the ff7 franchise is being milked like this
Satinsbestfriend,All 550 of you. If I'm being generous
NitrousIsAGas,And nobody cared.
phone_reddit_reader,Poor Heather Anne Campbell’s zeroth class
