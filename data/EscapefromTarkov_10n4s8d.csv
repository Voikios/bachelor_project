HorifiedBystander,This may work for braindead chad pmcs as well.
SourceNo2702,"Fun fact! This works on Interchange to take the scav/pmc extract. If you can get back there without any of the scavs seeing you, firing off a shot and moving to cover will get them to go into the extract zone."
_Nightdude_,"I also pull every PMC on the map with this method as well, works wonders"
RyuugaDota,"This trick has been possible for just over two wipes now. BSG added this behavior a while back, but this method wasn't as strong as it is now. This wipe I've noticed scavs come out of hiding from hearing gunshots much quicker, so this technique seems much more viable now.

One thing to note is other people shooting in a scav's leash range will fuck up your pulls. Not that you should be trying to pull scavs knowing other players are that close in the first place.

Edit: I haven't actually verified if scavs will come to silencers in online. Also they tend come one at a time online."
chalupacabraaas,Work with raiders?
NabuBot,Another lesser known scav trick. When they get aggrod they will aim and stare at a pmc through walls until the reach their last known position. Most of the time if ur not directly in their line of sight they will walk right past you. Also super easy to see where player could be hiding based off scav radar.
darkcathedralgaming,"Thanks I'm new and this was really interesting. I've been struggling to get scav kills for a while now because I end up not being able to find them, or a PMC kills them and/or gets me first."
Alpha_Whiskey_Golf,I wonder if that works for COOP extracts
MaxieFlyR,"This wipe you can also voiceline and the ai sometimes responds back with their voiceline, works with scavs, bosses and raiders too. Its good to get intel if you hear footsteps and you know the person walking heard you and you just want to check if its ai or not."
Appropriate_Lack_727,I swear those scavs would have headshot me from 80m with a TOZ long before they got to that manhole.
Sasu168,Wow how is your night vision so clean looking? Mine always looks hella dark and grainy
Kboehm,Holy using this i might actually be able to get my 40m bolt iron sight scav kills
lestevef,"Love this, thankyouverymuch"
MP7FUCKER,What pistol is that?
ill_nino_nl,Cheeky Breeky
CapnSoap,"Could've used this info last night when I ran a semi chad loadout and killed a scav in a bush by the swamp in old gas, laid down to loot him and ate his iskra and drank his juice since I was hidden anyway and a scav that had to have just spawned did this and tapped my head 

Thanks for it now though"
Tetsuo666,"Eheh of course it's the Dota player that does a ""pulling tutorial"" :)"
Acojonancio,I'm going to try it on Woods and see if I can complete som quests.
DuckInCup,I didn't know this. Super useful.
PanProjektor,Might be useful for shooter p1 & 2
Prestigious_End_2436,They'll usually run over to your area if you voiceline too
Skuld8989,"THIS is how you do the reserve underground warehouse kills, stand at bottom of ramp, shoot outside, move behind wall.


Running can pull them too just not from as far away."
ZeroUnits,"This is actually an awesome little video bro, thanks for the useful info!"
OCWBmusic,I've been playing Tarkov for over 3 years and never realized scavs actually investigate gunshots.
Sensitive_Regular388,"I think some people don't know but voicelines will cause scavs to push you sometimes, if they're close enough. Easy way to force them through a doorway"
Dentalswarms,Why would a bunch of former civilians just trying to survive be draw to a gunshot in a world full of dangerous pmc operatives? No sense of self preservation
DarthWeenus,How big is the area or radius of which they can hear and come to you? Is it the whole map? Or depend on the volume of the gunfire?
Santasam3,"This is so great, thank you for sharing this. Now please delete so no one else sees it and steals my scav kills ;)"
Esteozeka,Jesus Christ Tarkov AI is dumb af...
Yoghurt_Please,"This can be done with suppressors as well, it also works through walls, ceilings and floors."
Hendeith,">they can see trough them [bushes] this wipe

I don't think bushes ever obstructed their vision. Scavs were often shooting trough bushes and in some cases even followed your movement trough walls in previous wipes."
TheSmokeJumper_,This is the only way you get pest control done.
gd_akula,Sniper scavs are also very reactive to gunfire now. I've had a few instances where I would have definitely been within LOS of a sniper scavs but was ignored until I shot another scav.

Feuershark,I love how you have the top tier night vision but an ADAR
Frosty_Landscape_200,What’re your monitor/post fx settings for night time
ninjaxus,"This guy has amazing NVG, what is it??"
Educational-Web-5787,"Yeah, a scav player did this when I had him pinned down on customs.  He started shooting glass and attracted a group of scavs.  Didn't help him and they all died, but damn was I impressed at the resourceful strategy."
extramediumweldone,How it even possible. Scav shot me dead through the  night even when im staying low
MysticDicker,"Spatial audio is a thing too: voip at a ai scav and they’ll:
A. Notice and look at you for a ez dome 
B. Come to you cuz of the noise
C. Voiceline acknowledging your position"
pope-killdragon,"This also helps explain why I haven't been killed by a single scav this wipe while everyone else complains about how ""broken"" they are -- I rotate after literally *every* time I fire from a spot."
_inertia_creep_,"fascinating

No-Phase2131,The trick for the loosers.
Graematter,"This is called ""kiting"" in traditional MMOs."
