HertogJanVanBrabant,Nice.. Now do 500 heavy modular frames..
Astrama,That‚Äôs a production rate of 0.008333‚Ä¢ per minute. Pretty good.
moogoothegreat,"You don't need to hold down spacebar, you can just tap it once."
ChazCharlie,"You made a frame yes...

But is it modular?

Maybe it needs some interlock joints so you can stick several together."
neburmine,So the inventory crafting time has to be changed?
ArcKnightofValos,Looks like you did a welded modular frame.
Magdovus,"Ficsit regulation 79643 requires that pioneers continue working as showing off their products is a waste of valuable company resources

Also, nice."
WiseassWolfOfYoitsu,"Looks more like a Heat Fused Frame to me!

Modular frames would be more like bolted 8020 extrusion."
cchooper1,Now turn it into a fluid buffer.
Matix777,Your factory is very inefficient. Which recipe did you use?
Guty__18,"Nice work pioneer, now rump up production to 10/min"
vincent2057,"As a fellow person who could also actually make this, (also a welder) I'm impressed with it. You've made it very properly. The 2 way 45's are very nice and not how we usually make box frames. Very nice job! 

Was it just a random job you had in? Or just a laugh? As I assume it's not quite to scale so just a random job which makes it even more cool! 
We had an emergency mains water pipe turn up one morning the day after I'd spent the evening before doing pipe work in the game. It slightly blew my mind. It's not a usual job for us. Stuff that big."
Bladekai,You shouldnt craft by your hand you need to create factory of it this it how game works dudeeee.
DiamondExcavater,Eat a few slugs and it‚Äôll take you 30 min instead
Almsi_,"""My grinder and paint make me the welder I ain't"".

But in all seriousness awesome job! Welding is hard ,_,"
DarthLysergis,Now do a hypercube! :)
Slarkalark,"Now you know why we automate these. Back to work, Ficsit requires many more frames!"
SilentStrikerTH,You should really increase your production rate
CarnelianCannoneer,"Honestly, to measure, cut 12x, test fit, tack, readjusted so the final piece actually fits, weld, and buff the whole exterior, on a first-time making a piece, 2 hours seems pretty dang good."
Rangerbryce,You need overclocking bro...
eouw0o83hf,Nice! Shouldn't be too much more work to automate that to 10 per minute!
randomFrenchDeadbeat,"I believe the modular frame is called that way because it can slide in all dimensions.

So ... get back to work :D"
Atrocity_unknown,Just like the simulations
ATLSxFINEST93,Ayyyeee another fellow metalworker
iamthegordon,this needs to be merch
FlyterMax,That's some nice welding there!
TheRealOWFreqE,"There's a trick to make it faster so it doesn't take 2 hours! Press the craft button with your mouse, and then press the spacebar once. Ez!"
chintaka,"0.0083 MF per minute?
Gotta work on your factory bro, gotta pump those numbers up if you want to get into the endgame."
rl_fridaymang,Ah you need to increase your iron mines then the supply is not matching demand.  Just remember power.
Panic_00,Hate to tell you this.... Wrong size buddy.
Skullz64,"Nice

NOW DO HEAVY MODULAR FRAMES

***NOW DO FUSED MODULAR FRAMES***

********NOW DO NUCLEAR PASTA********"
Yah_or_Nah,Is it heavy?
TnekKralc,You are a .0083 per minute factory congratulations!
genbergfruehling,"Your body is a bad assembler. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man) Good work, pioneer."
realamericanhero2022,"Now you need a lead version, a heavy version‚Ä¶"
Loose-Eye-6945,I like it
DanTheMan_117,"Doesn't look very ""Modular"" to me."
Ttwister,"That is super cool, nice job... That would probably take me 2 days to build."
Winterfalke,"Well darn, we were machining them out of solid, took closer to 4 days."
FixTheCrop,Make a metal plate next.
Pelisont2020,What about heavy modular frame
Vasuhn,"Dont want to be a dick, but it doesnt look very modular xD"
Shagyam,2 hours? How slow did you underclock it?
wivaca,"The welds on the far joints look ""efficient"" :D

On the bright side, that's heavy enough you should be able to use it as a jack stand for car repairs."
KickBassColonyDrop,That's about how long it takes in the game too. So realistic!
elomenopi,"Bro, you got to automate that!"
rinter08,"Is your craft bench defective?

Jk, that's pretty cool!"
Terrible__Pickle,I want PASTA !
Drunkparrots,Sounds about right
andocromn,Hand crafting is a bitch!
canoIV,damn boi he THICC BOI **THAT'S A THICCASS BOI**
Blueflatts,"Compared to this, building a conveyor belt should be easy. 10 mins tops."
AdDiscombobulated447,I need to to step those numbers up ......lol
BunnyFooFoo_,"You seriously underclocked that, didn't you?"
Onoben4,"That makes 0,0083333333/per minute. You have to build a more efficent factory."
SlidePaste,Which alternate allows you to make only one?
Encursed1,So just as long as it takes in game? Why do we even need factories at that point?
OddAd6331,Checks out
Mrtwistd,Don't forget the pressure conversion cube
Jeffunchained,What recipe you use? :D
Hasi_1,now the supercomputer
MonsieurKas,You clicked space once?
asdanjer,Looks pretty heavy...
tethered_end,Man I want one
factoid_,"It only required twenty circuit boards, fourteen reinforced concrete beams, sixteen tons of rubber and plastic and some particle accelerators to make it."
HotIsland267,"Very cool. Very modular.


Now automate it"
TheArstotzkanGuard,"Next, make a factory"
Shadow_Leviathan_375,*its because you didn't have an assembler*
Pyrarius,"Trust me, the workbench is faster. It only felt like 2 hours because assemblers move slower than the stereotypical grandma without a walker (At 250% overclock, that grandma gets a walker)"
MrCombo16,Cute !
Hobbsie1769,"If you did that on a 5 axis, then you should stretch yourself.  Next machine a sphere inside."
ResponsibilityNo7485,That checks out
Subject-Bluebird7366,Is it heavy?
NightShades95,Aah just about the same time it takes my factory to produce one üëåüèª
librarian-faust,How many screws are in it?
Sweaty-Chocolate-390,Slugs would have reduced that 2hrs by quite a bit :)
