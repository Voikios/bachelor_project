MintBerryCrunchJr,Wait I thought he won and it was stolen?
Magoo69X,"Kellyanne continues to live in an alternate universe. No wonder George walked.

Of course the Trump family grifted - that's what they do. But Trump wasn't going to win anyway, because he was massively unpopular across a big chunk of the electorate. To blame campaign strategy for his loss is ludicrous."
thepartypantser,"In what universe does Trump win in a blowout? Trump had the consistently worst approval ratings of any modern president. He was extremely popular with his base, but his broad appeal has always been limited.

She's either delusional, or deliberately lying, and probably both."
UnderwhelmingAF,Trump being a horrible president for four years had a little something to do with it too.
OnWingsofGerbels,What a cute whitewash that completely ignored the attempted coup.
Sciencessence,"Anyone else think it's funny how all these politicians think that ""more money means we win"" when it comes to American politics? I mean, the only ways to conclude that is knowing that you can use money for propaganda and simultaneously believing that this is how things should go. I'm not an expert on how to run a government but this sounds like a hopelessly broken system that will end in a successful remake of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business\_Plot."
,"He lost the popular vote in 2016 by millions, screw the electoral system, so forgive me why I doubt becoming even more unpopular over the next 4 years would have earned him anything close to a “blowout” victory in 2020"
STL_Jayhawk,"Kellyanne needs understand one thing:  Trump will always be the grifter that he is.  He cannot change this.  He will always look to enrich himself at all other expenses, especial our Republic.

Had Trump led our nation through COVID as any good leader would have, he could have easily been reelected. But he could not do that since that is not in his character.  He is who he is.  He knew the truth about COVID and choose to lie since that is his nature.

Oh, her husband has a better understanding of how Donald is than she has."
DonnieBlueberry,"Oh no! The grifter grifted, and Kellyanne Conway showed her underage daughters nudes to the world."
squarepeg0000,Trump squandered...been the story ever since his Daddy left him millions.
RedditUser31422354,"The Crypt Keeper says what?

And why isn't she in prison for posting nude child pics on the web.  

Her own fricking daughter.

Absolute scum."
kn05is,"Oh, Kellyanne, he only just barely won the first time. The second time around people knew exactly what kind of mistake it would be to elect him again."
PatrickRU92,Republicans don't seem to understand that Trump lost because he's an unlikable unintelligent lying asshole.
Katana1369,She's delusional.
angrymoderate09,"Maybe he also lost because he downplayed a pandemic that would have hurt his hotels, restaurants and country clubs. 

Hey Kellyanne, maybe the piece of shit president should have sold his business before becoming president?"
Thetimmybaby,She's always wrong.
,[deleted]
vs-1680,"squandered... laundered...

Seems like more financial crime"
Joshuaperlson,"Nonsense headline.  He spent $5 million on his properties out of $1.6 Billion. That's one third of 1 percent. $57 million spent on Merchandise and donor gifts (which is apart of campaigning) comes out to another 3%. The majority of his war chest was spent on advertising. All this clickbait article explains is with $1.6 billion, Trump still couldn't beat Biden. He didn't piss that money away or steal it, he's just a loser."
greenascanbe,"She doesn’t give any details on where the money went, etc. This is an idiot saying absolutely nothing of importance and nothing new. Why people like her get a platform I will never understand."
Killieboy16,Money laundering.
SuperSpecialAwesome-,"Reminder: This is the woman who had tweeted out child pornography of her underage daughter a few years back, and faced no punishment from Barr or Garland."
PMUrAnus,"Also Kellyanne: I will support and cheerlead for Trump 2024

These people have no moral compass whatsoever"
plaidington,Conway cannot see the forest for the trees.
greeperfi,"Raise your hand if you believe anything Kellyanne ""alternate facts"" Conway says"
crispy48867,"Trump has zero chance in 24.

At the rate things are going, the democrats will make a clean sweep in 24.

The republicans want to kill  social security and run  Trump? they will pay dearly for that level of stupidity."
plant_lyfe,Squandering $1.6 billion seems pretty on brand for trump
EivorIsle,"It’s strange to me that money equals victory for these people. Even if he had more in his war chest, I don’t think he would have won. His behavior, cruelty, and corruption were on total display in TV, and in social media. He was fully unfit and the majority of voters saw that."
akadros,This is almost as dumb as people saying Trump should have won because he had more people at his rallies than Biden.
Mokey_Maker,"This was always the plan. Run a campaign, embezzle the money. Winning was never intended."
Real-Patriotism,"#Stole.

Not squandered.

Stole.

Because he is nothing more than a two bit conman thief who stole hundreds of millions from Americans who didn't know any better."
tripleelbow,"plus, he was an incompetent corrupt piece of shit, and there's that.."
j____b____,Embezzlement?
mdingo_5,Lucky for us the fascists lost for now.
jewelandparsons,"Wow, she continues to overestimate his appeal. How much of the $1.6 billion did she get?"
dominantspecies,And she was a complicit piece of garbage.
Adventurous_Whale,k. Why is anyone listening to Kellyanne again?
supernovadebris,You want a criminal that wasted $1.6B to run the country? To own the libs?
kezow,"Uhhh, Kellyanne, that isn't ""squandered"", that's embezzlement."
irascible_Clown,"Money don’t mean shit, no one wanted dude here so he lost.  They wil make up any excuse lol"
BigMACfive,Isn't this the lady who intentionally leaked a topless picture of her 16 year old daughter on Twitter? How is she waking around freely?
Salvia_McLovin,"How is that not grounds for criminal charges?  You can’t use campaign donations for personal use.

santos and trump are degenerates who need hard prison time"
username_not_found0,There's also the fact that he let over half of a million Americans die in a very easily avoidable plague. That really annoyed a bunch of people
tegularian,Or he could just have handled Covid better and he probably would have cruised to re election regardless of what he spent.
LandosMustache,"Here’s the scariest part: it WAS a blowout for Trump. In a way.

Joe Biden received the most votes in history. Donald Trump received the SECOND most votes in history. 

Don’t let ANY Republican tell you that they never supported Trump. They supported him, and they turned out in record numbers to vote. He is EXACTLY who they wanted as President. Again."
Grimm2020,"oh, I long for the days when Republicans didn't ""buy"" votes, but earned them based on their record and public service...  /s"
Fit-Firefighter-329,The election was a blowout for Trump: He blew it right out of his ass.
everythingunder1USD,"So she's also admitting that the way the system ""is supposed to work""  is the candidate with the most money wins. Pretty sure that's not democracy."
fractal_pudding,squandered = laundered
thistimelineisweird,A weird way to say he laundered it through his grift.
Toothlessdovahkin,"Wow. I for one am shocked, SHOCKED I tell you, that a known con man and grifter grifted money from somebody else. I am absolutely shocked that this happened! Morons."
professorwhiskers87,I don’t think she has a clue about how much the average American hates Trump.
strain_gauge,I don't know that there was enough money on the planet to make the election successful for Trump.  I think she's drastically underestimating the number of people that are tired of his shit.
The_Captain_LIGMA,When the worst person you know makes a dumb ass statement.
businessboyz,"Campaign money was not helping Trump in 2020. 

MAGA had hit the point of significant diminishing returns on ad spending and turnout engagement. Trump’s name and brand was fully known so more ad spend on awareness would have been a waste. 

The GOP doesn’t have actual popular policy to run on either so pushing “inflation is bad!” rhetoric doesn’t do you any favors when you have no plans on actually fighting inflation that you can talk about in the follow up. 

Anger, fear, and disgust are incredibly effective emotions to tap into when it comes to politics. But reliance on those emotions only gets you so far while simultaneously engaging folks on the other side. It gets the MAGA base to turn out but turns off just as many other people while riling up liberals and moderates to vote against the right wing party across the board."
keirmeister,"Should have been a blowout?  And the two impeachments were irrelevant, then?"
thecanofmase,He’s never even won the popular vote…
Cold_Situation_7803,"“Trump should’ve won but he mismanaged billions,” is quite the endorsement."
felixbotticelli,"This POS can't admit the simple fact that Trump is, and always has been a criminal."
upnk,COVID. Trump would have sailed to re-election if his response to COVID was completely different.
Trishjump,"He would’ve won if he wasn’t such a corrupt fraud…..

Weird flex Kellyanne, but ok"
MyHamburgerLovesMe,This just in:  Republicans admit they buy elections...
drunkenjawa,"He didn’t lose because he pissed away money, he lost because he was a shitty candidate. Sure he got 76 million votes, but the winner got 81 million, because he was the better candidate."
elnerdometalero,"Yeah that's why every sane person knew his ""management"" skills were always bullshit."
fixit858,Grifters gonna grift.
millenialfalcon-_-,He used it to flex on Biden which cost him lol . We all know he doesn't make good financial decisions
HW2O,Instead he lost by 7 million votes. Sad.
havereddit,"So in conclusion, Kellyanne Conway suggests that the election was stolen from Trump by Trump himself"
Jammin_TA,"I don't think ANY amount of money would change the fact that he lost by a ""landslide"" (by his definition).  The VAST majority of the country loathes him.

Unless she thinks more money could've been spent to subvert democracy.  Perhaps he could've armed his Jan. 6th mob? It's probably this."
Upper-Discount5060,The Republican National Committee paid $300K for Trump Jr’s books to give to donors. Wow.
OneOfAKind2,"As if. He didn't even win the first election. He lost the popular vote and won the electoral college due to Russian interference. Luckily, enough people figured out he was an ignorant conman after the first 4 years. Don the Con."
AustinDood444,Some of the money went to his properties?? Isn’t that illegal??
mountainskygirl,"He couldn’t manage a country.
He couldn’t manage a pandemic.
He couldn’t manage a campaign.
We can’t manage to re-elect him!"
Overall-Beginning-74,That’s all Trump wanted was to profit off of using the office of the POTUS to line his pockets and his slimy family members as well. He was not interested in being a real President. He has no clue in being a statesman and such. You can’t run the country like a business. He has verified that now and should stay in his lane as a two bit grifter and shifty business provider.
SuperGenius98K,Lady Goebbels is a traitor to America.
Unusual_Baby865,"First, there is no reason why we continue litigating an election that WAS LOST BY TRUMP TWO YEARS AGO. This was not a squeaker as TRUMP LOST BY 7 MILLION VOTES. Nevertheless, the media perpetuates the inaccurate portrait of a close election as clickbait. Moreover, it appears that the campaign was funneling money to Trump and his family which confirms the large scale grift that was the hallmark of the GQP Presidential campaign. Second, Trump had smooth sailing for the first two years as President and Trump took credit for what he had inherited from Obama (big surprise, as he did the same thing with his inheritance from his father). Trump faced one major crisis in his presidency : COVID. TRUMP’S MANAGEMENT OF THE COVID CRISIS WAS FUBAR.  No one outside of MAGA will forget Trump’s COVID meltdown. Trump has had his last act on the Presidential stage."
minus_minus,"Unpopular opinion: she’s right in a very narrow sense. 

Trump lost the electoral college by 42,921 votes across AZ, GA, and WI. Doubtless the Republican data operation was aware of the tight contest in these states and the millions wasted on renting empty trump property offices could have gotten them over the line. 

It’s the worst part of American politics but money *can* get you votes.

Edit: technically he *lost* by 42,918 votes and **needed** 42,921 to win. Oops."
SkankBiscuit,"So, the person who spends the most money should win?  Is that the way it works?  If so, this country is up a creek."
OneMetalMan,So she's upset that he acted in the way voters voted him out for?
Shaytanic,I think Trump's life story is how he could have done many smart things but squandered all the money.
regalfronde,“Trump shoulda won if only he wasn’t himself!”
Devadander,Grifter gonna grift. Trump has always been who he is. It’s everyone else that’s surprised for some reason
daveashaw,"As I recollect, the woman who coined the phrase ""alternative facts."""
ThickerSalmon14,"His campaign didn't squander the money.  He took it for his own personal profit. Then seeing what the head guy did, all the underlings did the same thing.

So less squander and more graft."
top_value7293,"And she thinks this fool should be in the highest office in our country, lawdy"
Financial-Tower-7897,Wait! I thought she didn’t believe in factual facts?
TequilaMagic,Maybe if he talked less and avoided social media lol. Big maybe.
GamerSDG,"It is interesting to me that the party that wants people to forget that Bush was their president, is the same party that acts as if Trump is a political genius. With that being said.

Trump is, was, and will be a bad candidate. He won in 2016 because Hillary was the worst candidate than him. All signs pointed to Trump being a 1 term president. He had one of the lowest turn out for inauguration. He is the first president to never receive a 50% approval rating. There was protest almost every day of his presidency.

Then his ego didn't help him at all. Most Americans do not want to hear about the president, yet Trump kept himself in the news almost every day, by saying and doing stupid stuff.

You get invited to eat at the White House, you expect to have some of the best cut of steak not a big mac with cold fries. He embarrassed America."
TheDakoe,Kellyanne *I post nude photos of my minor daughter on twitter* Conway?
dendron01,Did anyone seriously believe a guy like Trump was going to sit on a cash pile that big and not siphon any off for himself...
floyd_underpants,Who would have guessed he was bad with money?
Angryleghairs,Why did she leave it til now to say anything??
Agelmar2,"He won in 2016 purely because people hated Hillary Clinton more than they hated him.

He was never going to win"
Up_words,"Trump culters live in an alternate reality. Honestly, anyone who thinks Trump should have won under any condition is a loony."
_SpaceTimeContinuum,"It wasn't squandered, it was embezzled."
whereveriland,No amount of advertising dollars would have made me vote for that lump
TheWrightPhD,Anyone willing to spend $1.6b to become president probably isn't a person you want to be president...
dimechimes,"Yeah Kellyanne, he's proven time amd time again he's crazy incompetent"
Schlitzerland,"It wasn’t about them not spending enough on campaign ads. 

It was about more than half of the country being terrified of what was happening and being motivated to vote for whomever was running against Trump. 

I honestly would have gladly voted for a Democrat baboon.

And I HATE baboons."
benadrylpill,And somehow he's still broke.
FastCarsSlowBBQ,The grifter grifts.
Level_-_Up,"Republicans learned in 2020 what Democrats learned in 2016. 

&#x200B;

A huge war chest means nothing if you're running a supremely unlikable candidate."
yukonhoneybadger,The trump stain is so bad it hurt the mid terms. He was not winning that election
mettiusfufettius,"Wait wait wait, so you’re telling me Trump is just some grifter??? I refuse to believe it. The collectible nft card in front of me insists he is an astronaut!"
IProgramSoftware,I kinda have a problem with a presidential campaign needed 1+ billion dollars to win in the first place. That is just far too much money
samweswriteshorror,Conservatives- I gotta ask- just how tired of all that ‘winning’ are you right now?
Lost-Biscotti-3115,This question may make me seem dumb but how does more money make someone win? Like are there that many voters out there that vote for someone just because they see more ads for that candidate?
NbleSavage,Funny / sad how all those who benefited from the tRump 2020 grift are now dropping him like a hot rock.
Rambos_Beard,"Hmmm... just a theory. 

Trump knowingly used that money to pay debt or increase the value of his properties.

Trump has always been a bullshit artist for as far back as I can remember in the 80s and 90s. Always negotiating debt, exploiting every loophole and most likely cooking books. The only good money generating stuff going on are his properties. Pretty much every other business venture has tanked, but his properties haven't. 

In 2016 he probably ran thinking that just him doing so would increase his ""value"" and not really thinking that he'd actually win. From what I recall, he didn't have a transition team in place like Clinton. But he won, probably not really expecting such a turnout from people in the south to vote for a New Yorker. He wins and is now like ""oh fuck"" because it's really happening. Now he has to be president and has no clue what that even entails. But he knows how to self promote and he knows he has to get cronies into his cabinet to keep things hush hush. But when it comes to actually understanding how to run a country he's like ""fuck it, I don't care. I'm president now and I'm going to use every second I can to milk every penny I can from these dumb people that voted for me who are easily duped."" So in 2020 he runs again, and probably truly thinks he has 50/50 odds, but who cares. He now gets to flaunt at his properties that he was the president and use that as a selling point to investors who actually have money to spend. But to these poor idiots that voted for him, the easily duped people that he wouldn't touch with a 10' pole, he's selling them all these junk knickknacks to promote his brand. Sell poor people a $50 hat that cost $2 to make. 

In the end, does he really want to be president, or does he really only see this as an opportunity to rip more people off to pay for his properties."
Blurry12yo,"Fuck you, Kellyanne. trump is not being ""persecuted."" trump attempted a coup, a destruction of the U.S. Constitution, and he's being treated with kid gloves to avoid pissing off his violent idiot followers."
