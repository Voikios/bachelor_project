Wheat9546,"jesus at least the camera isnt so fucking cancerous anymore.

&#x200B;

Sure there is a big initial jump but by god this is good shit here"
BananastasiaBray,No more noodle arms!
FelixTheCuteTrap,glad to see you finally activated windows :D
Firefly3564,"Finally, a video where people don’t control the recoil then show a before and after"
Susp,Imagine ppl defending the previous iteration how brainfucked they are
xXPalmoXx,You put in the effort to make this gif but put the latter clip on the left in the side by side comparison.  WHY?? And why does it bother me so much
gearhead1309,Now that feels good to see!
axloc,"BEFORE.ALWAYS.GOES.ON.THE.LEFT.

Why is this a trend??"
CoughItUp22,"Amazing. Put some mods on a fal and it might be useable again. Kind of ridiculous this visual recoil change didn't already happen and it's just coming now, but hey, I am *not* complaining."
MapReasonable5265,It's still a laugh and unrealistic.
Tommypaura,The First kick is a bit too much...
openclosebracket,Such an awesome change. Didn’t go back to old school but didn’t concede recoil completely
SnooCookies9055,now i wanna see the new camera recoil on an ash-12
Rimbaldo,That still looks abysmal lol
KayNynYoonit,The first shot is still atrocious but we're getting there
jase213,Damn i'm unironicly going to install the game now
JustBakedPotato,And there’s still neanderthals arguing that it was better before the update lmao
Electrical-Reindeer4,"It's funny how we can all complain about it. vertais does a video a few days later, and it's fixed. I guess we all need to go to his page and thank him"
3-Tron,you actually rest the buttstock on your chin silly goose. Why don’t you actually learn to fire a gun. We need more visual recoil so you can’t see the subreddit to post a complaint. I’m sick and tired of people complaining about this please go outside and or something idk.
EastAd9769,Meh still terrible
Key_Transition_6820,Oo my god you guys open up pandora's box full of juice cannons. F in the chat now for the those mad about armor and ammo changes. 30 round mag sa-58 are back in business. Lol
Kopulus,I have not played in a long time and I would like to ask if the short modified fal is finally useful or not ?
forstyy,makes prefiring even stronger. the first kick is way too much.
skcuf2,"I think this represents the most egregious action BSG has taken. They've designed a game that changes how you interpret the information on the screen and alters how your controls work. The mobility changes with different armors and this screen bouncing when shooting is super annoying for gameplay.

As players, we have three inputs. Sound is screwed, but that's unintentional. The visual was screwed because of this seizure inducing recoil crap. The touch and inputs change based on how much gear you pick up leading to frustration with base movement after looting.

BSG has made some weird choices."
whiteteepoison2,The barrel flip up is still an issue for some guns but were moving in the right direction for sure
ZachMartin,Bro did you put the before on the right side? And the after on the left? Are you a psycho?
MyNuts2YourFistStyle,Recoil is still way overexaggerated
HJALMARI,"Much better, but losing our sights in the ring/housing, in irons or holo, dots and so needs to be adjusted slightly better."
HowDiddleDo,u/savevideo
StealthCatUK,"With the barrel flip up it's like you have to just aim in the general direction and hope for the best because you can't fucking see, unless you want to fire at 5 rpm."
The_Dud3_Abides_,"The FAL is good again, I’m going to cry"
MagicSceptre,"stock sa58 like that always fired like on the right for me, i still haven't played since the patch as ive been taking a small break but what i see one the second one seems to look like how recoil pattern was before."
EnoughTelephone,wtf were they thinking
