eru777,"I always wondered how the bears and other animals survive in tomb raider games. And how the pools are beyond clean always, with no one in sight."
WindUpShoe,"Of course, Skyrim has no end of mods. Some eliminate all light in a dungeon except for what would occur naturally, like from luminous fungus or exposure to the outdoors.     
     
And it's, naturally, dark af. You can barely see around you, even with torches and spells. You can light up whatever braziers and candles and other sources are around, but that's about it. It's neat, it adds a level of immersion, but it's annoying micromanagement, usually the bane of big budget mainstream games."
RallyPointAlpha,He also resets all the traps.
yaosio,"In Skyrim the Dragur maintain their own tombs. Living people leave gold and food offerings outside the tombs and the Dragur bring the offerings inside. The claw puzzle is meant to keep the more powerful but dumb undead from escaping while allowing the living to enter. I don't know how food gets past the door as it would have to be Dragur opening them, but they are too dumb to open them. Maybe there's a Dragur dumbwaiter somewhere."
DeVulgariEloquentia,"The game that really brought this to my attention was actually Zelda: Skyward Sword.

There is one part where you are chasing after someone. They lead you to a dungeon. You get to the dungeon and everything is essentially untouched: all the traps, blockades, puzzles etc are there and you have to get through them. The person is at the end somehow. It made absolutely no sense."
Pryamus," - So you are here to like greet adventurers and help them?
 - Help? Oh hell no. I am here to bury them. Usually you all fall into a bottomless pit for me to pick you up, but since you made it this far... Do you prefer poison gas or a stab with a blade?
 - What! Don’t stab me!
 - Yeah, wise choice, it kinda hurts. Just breathe deeper."
DMoney159,Reminds me of [this](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Cwu1rCjb1Fk)
dae_giovanni,"hm, _Moonlighter_ showed us a look at the other side of shops in adventure games... maybe this concept should be explored next?    


you have to reset and maintain an increasingly-complex series of dungeons and tombs, all while doing your best to stay out of sight of The Hero.  The Hero is a hellish monster, a true cryptid known for tearing apart the lives of your less-fortunate colleagues, and inspiring tales of grim woe for generations.  

of course, what appears as a cryptid to a dungeon-dwelling zombie looks like a mere garden-variety adventurer to you or i.  their appearance is randomised when you enter the dungeon-- in some cases, it's just a tiny human child with a spellbook causing all this terror in the goblin community."
MikeColorado,"Finally the mystery has been solved!!! Far cry brought this to light in one of the series where the antagonist makes the comment ""And I really want to know who is lighting all these candles."""
EvenAH27,So every dungeon in Skyrim is just basically an escape room?
Litigating_Larry,"'But the crypt has been sealed for thousands of years, how did all this contemporary legal tender get in at all??'

""Well, we have a back door, too..."""
nduanetesh,"I feel like the even more egregious version of this is Doom. Every time I'm in a literal hellscape populated by demons whose only desire is to rend flesh, my primary thought is ""who lit all these candles?"""
Dickpuncher_Dan,"One big, giant miss Skyrim did, though: no child draugr. How creepy would that have been, them running toward you and climbing over any obstacle to get you, like those disgusting kids in Dead Space 2, the decompressed strip mall scene."
CJ7h3g4m3r,this been bothering me for some time in those dangeon games. I guess he's the real **dangeon keeper**.
k20350,"My friend and I call it the the ""Chest Draggers Union"". The guys that keep all the torches lit and drag chests full of unruined loot into ancient sealed tombs, mountain tops, bottom of oceans, etc"
redmercuryvendor,"Dungeon Delving Logistics Simulator: You need to arrange transport of equipment to the middle of bumfuck nowhere with no power or roads, deal with drilling through a capstone without collapsing a hillside, make sure everyone is wearing Confined Space Gas Detectors when entering somewhere that hasn't been ventilated for centuries, check for Radon, hand out the SCBA for initial exploration and setting up ventilation gear, fitting out the place with lighting, fitting out hardpoints and rope gear for descending vertical shafts, etc."
mumbler1,So.. Dungeons are a tourist attraction and we're the tourists?
GlobalPhreak,"Uncharted is terrible about this...

Spend 30 minutes unlocking a death trapped tomb that has been sealed for 500 years...

Other side is filled with bad guys who got here before you."
Metalicz,"If done well enough I think park of ancient civilization mystique is that, after all this time, they could still be lit. What rubs me the wrong way is when you crack a place open for the first time and the army that's been chasing you is already set up and fortified."
DooMGodMode,"Sooooo.....?
What do we say to Sven??
""Thaaank youuu Sveeen!"""
rydamusprime17,"Ah Sven, a truly unsung hero."
rorys_beard,Oh so this this the skeleton in the barrel? That's just were they take their breaks.
Teleskopy,I liked this detail in the Witcher. If you went into a place without humans all the torches and braziers were off.
FirstConsul1805,I'd give the man a tip.
RedditBoi127,"thanks Sven, Master of Dungeon Upkeep"
Smart_Interaction_34,Loved the use of darkness in Dragons Dogma.  It’s a shame more games aren’t like that.
MeTheCube,He also refills the arrow traps
ninjapandaman94,Thank you sven
andrea_ci,"Well, but there's a way more pressing question.

To enter this dungeon I had to solve 10 puzzles, find secret keys, unseal the entrance, fight 12321312 huge monsters... and in the next room, here they are, my enemies. That were following me."
Suitable_Ad_696969,*Dungeon (up)Keeper
Just-Lie-3360,The answer is Magic.
starknight23Yt,Essentially Assassin's Creed dungeons in a nutshell
Malkier3,Literally every ancient tomb in AC:Odyssey
Boner_Patrol_007,My old college roommate and I use to joke about Draugr working behind the scenes resetting the traps in dungeons lol
Undying4n42k1,The adventurer only hears groaning and kills the zombie custodian.
marshallmagid,Hood
Economy-Chicken-586,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Cwu1rCjb1Fk
JohnnyPantySeed,Thanks for the Shadowgate feelings
thisisyourreward,I have wondered!
bugoid,"A strange, vaguely Finnish janitor was seen shuffling around, repeatedly muttering ""perkele"" under his breath."
megamisch,I just assume most ancient crypts are from a time of lost magic that had undying flames or some junk like that. Maybe torches die if you remove them but as long as they are untouched they just burn a slow and nearly ice cold flame that gently illuminates the tomb for centuries.
captrudeboy,Dungeon cop?
Inside_Session_4251,Literally India jones
Darth-Yslink,"There's a lore explanation for the food and torches in Skyrim, but how the hell do Modern septims get in there"
DI0nysOO2,In god of war how they just established that the dwarves can teleport anywhere for some reason
dragonpjb,He deserves a tip.
Painty_The_Pirate,Facilities staff >>> any other staff
kaiwowo,Skyrim dungeon is like
that_dumb_warlock,Thank you Sven
BambaTallKing,"I actually had an idea for a game that is kinda based on this idea. You have to venture into a maze that goes deep into the earth below the mountains. There are always lit torches and they keep the real nasty beasties away. However, you can take torches or they can go out by themselves. When they do, a torch troll will scream throughout the maze and come to
Relight/replace the torch. If he sees you, you best run."
aciakatura,Reminds me of a text game about a dungeon cleaner. They have to basically reset all the dungeon puzzles.
SmoggyEagle332,"in actuality, India Jones"
TheGremlin02,"Raul, is that you?"
dan1101,"Yes more games should have dark uninhabited places, and loot not scattered everywhere.  There should be treasure rooms and occasional hidden caches."
NoiselessDwelling845,"Loved how Dragons Dogma used darkness.  Unfortunately, fewer video games are like that."
eat_your_words136,"The food and candles in Skyrim have a lore reason, but how the heck do Modern septims get in there?"
JumbledTycoon777,"A true unsung hero, Sven."
AbsorbingBroth141,Zelda: Skyward Sword was the title that truly made me aware of this.
fierceairtime61244,"However, there is a far more urgent question."
Well-wornLifeline284,"Additionally, he resets each trap."
FatalRadiance330,"However, there is a far more urgent question."
aching_feedback346,"Truth be told, India Jones"
wildstarr,Original?  This joke/comic has been made hundreds of times over the past couple of decades.
