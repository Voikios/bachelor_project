NervousJ,"I think that's valid criticism. The locations that they have all have style, but not so much diversity. I'd like to see more diverse set pieces and textures in the future.


Oh, and let us use ladders!"
wilhelmthe11,"I completely agree with you the kost common argument about this is its the games style. style =/= diversity i would love to see something other than concrete and metal, mabey nasty crusty carpets fancy lights and desks in a govenors quarters, and corrogated, ram shackle structure built out of scraps."
OverlordZombwich,That and the space combat are the biggest downsides of the game. On the bright side it's nowhere near as bad as Darktide. Not saying either are bad by any means but they're nothing to write home about either.
TotsukePrime,I think that would come over time but if they did a mid reinforcement patch to edit the some stats and test things that be really cool for the future of the game! It's keep it spicy and we see change twice.oer build seeing what works and what does not! And i does not need to be big changes all the time.
IrrelevantTale,"I fucking love the terraformer for this reason. Running around the sprayers spraying feels sooooo cool. It's all CQC most because y'kno space, but on that map it feels extra cool to play."
imAwdeeOtherSide,Definitely agree. Early hours in the game. If it wasn't for the outside environment I wouldn't have a clue I was in a different map most of the time.
buckzor,"100% agree. Wonder how the Unreal engine handles water.. A large Water Extraction & Refinement station nestled into an Ice Rock would sure be interesting.  Especially if you had to swim through sections unable to fire any projectiles BUT able to slashy wacky with Melee while under.  AI with a subnautical Navy Seal feel, possibly able to swim faster with maybe Spearguns?  We already have rebreathers so being under water should be no issue."
