Jack_Q_Frost_Jr,He knew conservatives would be the easiest marks. He was right.
NoWayNotThisAgain,The best part of this is watching the lack of integrity of his fellow republicans get exposed as they jump through hoops to keep supporting him.
Madhavaz,"He could smell the money. It's all about the grift. Tomorrow I could start being a right wing grifter and within a year be a millionaire....

Hey, wait a minute. Excuse me..."
LobstahmeatwadWTF,Isnt he wanted for some crimes back in brazil?
Skorpyos,Being an extreme right wing operative is much more profitable.
Far-Jump-5486,"Same reason Trump switched.

Conservatives are ripe for the taking and have zero critical thinking skills."
Donald-Pump,I'm so ready for this idiot to be out of the news. Can he just resign in disgrace already?
Who_DaFuc_Asked,"Seems like he had the same ""I can make so much money grifting the idiots on the right"" idea that I've had many times.

Only difference is that he's actually twisted enough to go out and do it. I *say* I'll do it quite often, but I'm not shitty enough to go through with it."
Dampware,[the BIG PICTURE BOOK of GEORGE SANTOS AMAZING LIFE! ] (https://sites.google.com/view/the-amazing-life-of-George)
bwheelin01,Criminals recognize criminals. I’m convinced any person running with an R next to their name at this point is strictly an opportunistic grifter with zero interest in governing
Redditfront2back,Proof that anyone that can lie can be an elected republican
PM_ME_UR_RESPECT,"Dude, it’s getting sad at this point.

It’s blatantly obvious to anyone paying attention, and I hate to say it because again it makes me sad, but conservatives are rubes. These people have progressively seen how gullible they are and now there’s a feeding frenzy. 

They smelled blood in the water when they saw Trump’s popularity rose prior to the 2016 election and they haven’t stopped since."
EldritchSlut,"Imagine if we took money out of politics and politicians were only working for the betterment of the people. We wouldn't have *nearly* as many of these stories where a conservative person is looking down on or doing something they say they're against.

Shit, if our politicians weren't suckling the teat of the rich we would likely have healthcare, people would be fed, and this manufactured inflation that's making us all poorer would have been nipped I'm the bud back when they first thought they could pull one over on the working class. 

Instead, we just get the stick."
PositionParticular99,Santos is whoever he needs to be to pull a scam.
sugar_addict002,"He didn't didn't run on a whim.  Someone ""encouraged"" him.  Trace the origin of his money."
Eat_the_Path,"[Trump has been a registered Democrat, Reformer & Republican](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_career_of_Donald_Trump).

Grifters go where the money is at."
Dry-Bathroom3658,being a republican politician is basically an extremely immoral form of drag when you think about it.
GrantSRobertson,"I am now convinced that he got all of his money from the Republican party. I'm convinced that they knew he was lying all along, and they did whatever they could to get him elected. Why? Because he provides a really good distraction. While we're all watching the George Santos show, the Republicans are quietly destroying democracy."
Zanchbot,"He knew it would be easy to fool a bunch of conservatives, and unfortunately he was right. Bunch of easy marks."
Truffans,Is George even Tony’s real name?
youveruinedtheactgob,Whenever I run across a gay Republican (and they are definitely out there) I immediately assume they’re a sociopath.
brasswirebrush,"He didn't just pop up out of nowhere and win a race all on his own.  Someone chose him to be the front-man, organized, and paid for his campaign.  Be interesting to find out who that was."
SecondTryBadgers,This dude is a distraction. I’m not super into politics but I have a feeling that someone is doing some really shady shit and it being overlooked for this low hanging piece of shit.
CankerLord,"Is it just me or are right wingers their own unique brand of especially gullible marks? I mean, scams don't have a political leaning but there's a *lot* of ways to make money selling explicitly right wing nonsense."
NomDePlume007,"So basically, New York elected Borat to Congress."
whomda,"I'm still grappling with the fact that people care more about when he dressed up in costume as a different gender, rather than the extensive lies about his credentials."
Spaghettyo,"If only I was shameless and doesn't care how much people will hate me, I definitely would run for a republican office."
Ready_Nature,If you’re a conman trying to get money from political campaigns conservatives are an easy mark.
Gavin_Newsom,There's a reason people right-wing grift.  Easy money.  It's also why the left-wing grift isn't a thing.
Cyber_Dan,"I’m noticing a trend with all these right wing psychos, there’s a whole lot of South Americans and Cubans in their ranks."
Alert-Fly9952,"I knew the water circled the drain differently when crossing the equator,  but this is ridiculous."
mikeP1967,He saw how gullible the Right is and how to exploit them for $
RepugsArentHuman,"Conservatism always leads to fascism, terrorism, and pedophilia."
histo320,He's not right or left.  He's a con man.  And the smart voters in NY actually voted him into office. Maybe do some research before you vote and don't vote along party lines.
Mmmmffffeeerrrr,Maybe he is a Trojan horse
RunningToZion,"He did what Trump did, realized who the stupid people were and joined their side."
Puttor482,Is this dude getting cawthorned? Do Republicans make them go and commit kompromat before they support them?
beetbear,This will be the thing that really angers the Right....
mtarascio,George Santo is a Lizard Person e.g. a Chameleon changing to his current environment in order to survive and prosper.
molobodd,"Some people flip flop between political extremes. On a rare occation it means they have an open mind. More often than not, they are just fools, though."
Grandexperiment,It is so tragic that his family was in the holocaust and his mother died at the towers on 911
porlosmuertos,Pure sociopath wil say anything to anyone
JJDude,You mean turn into a Russian agent for money and power beyond his imagination to hurt a country he didn't give a flying rat's ass about? He's not even a traitor - he's just working for Papa Putin to fuck the Americans.
pianoboy8,"please be a left wing sleeper agent

please be a left wing sleeper agent

please be a left wing sleeper agent"
MiggySay,Opportunistic Brazilian ConArtist
Snugglebuggle,This just goes to show why vetting processes need to happen before someone is elected
Enlightened_Ghost_,"He's one of those, like Trump, that is whatever is most convenient at that moment. Not really anything at all when you cut down to the deepest layer. 

Trump and Hillary were such friends that he invited her to his wedding. Years later, he's this alt-right champion. It's ridiculous and barely covers the fact that he will play any side that benefits him. Just like this boy Santos. Both sociopathic liars with fragile egos and shaky claims to any thing remotely verifiable as truth."
Seastep,Undiagnosed personality disorders are all around us.
Megatf,"Says a lot about George Santos that I believe a random Drag Artist in Brazil over the elected politician George Santos  

Caveat, Not that I wouldnt believe something a person says (drag artist or not), but if random people came out on the internet and said, “Trump randomly said to me one time he loves Democrat policies and was a huge Obama fan” I’d be like, “Okay, random person, Trumps a shitty person but I doubt that.”  George Santos is such a fucking liar I’m like, “She probably telling the truth”"
CaptOblivious,Every day this looks more like a borat movie in real life.
SubversiveWare,"IF America had rejected tRump, this pathological liar, wouldn't be here now."
jasap1029,I don't know about everyone else but I'm starting to think that this guy might not be the most trustworthy
NightSavings,*Who is this person? He fooled so many.*
BlueShift42,He saw a reality tv star play a role upon a mountain of lies and now he thinks he can too.
branedead,"Maybe the left is missing the message here. Run as republican, be outraged by all the silly shit that Ra yell at, but then vote leftwing.
Pretend to be a right-wing nut job, but vote left"
billzilla,"Because this is how you get elected and get a fuckton of money, obviously. It's easy to do. Look at Musk and Trump - also previously non-nationalists (but always grifters) capitalizing on the rightzis' lunacy and hysteria. 'Pay me if you want to survive the assault on white identity and religion' is a ~~powerful~~ profitable message."
SquirrelDumplins,R/conservative
zootsuitbeatnick,"Con-men have no political philosophies, just scams."
RedlandRenegade,"These fucks just want fame. They don’t care which side they’re on, just as long as they see themselves in the paper, on the news and internet. Narcissists."
geneticeffects,He wasn’t a “Leftist” but he certainly has all the familiar traits of a sociopathic Conservative. Georgieboi will say and do anything to get what he wants. It is your stereotypical malignant Narcissist.
jz1127,Sleeper agent?
Dr_Tacopus,"The reason for “this crazy thing” is called money.  He was obviously bought by some group to run as a gay republican to get votes in a contested district, and it worked. All efforts should be put in it tracking down who paid him to do this and creating strong ethical standards for elected officials"
PopeHonkersXII,I can guarantee you he didn't just recently turn crazy
,[removed]
SCOTUSOPO,"I'm gonna channel my inner Obi Wan and ask who's more foolish, the fool, or the fool who votes for him?"
elshizzo,"This is how politics works in the US.  Hasan and his uncle Cenk talk about this all the time.   Going the right wing route is a way more profitable route.  For a lot of them its just a grift.   The marks/voters are an extremely manipulable bunch, and the funders (billionaires/corporations) have big pockets"
allrollingwolf,"Honestly, I think this guy is awesome. Taking the republican clown archetype to the absolute extreme and exposing just how corrupt and ridiculous they are as they fumble to continue supporting him."
CoolAbdul,Diamond and Silk were rabid left wingers until they realized the grift opportunities were much better on the other side.
Appropriate_Lemon254,"🎶🎶 Money money money, must be funny, in a rich man's world. 🎶🎶🎶🎶"
SnowSlider3050,The USA- where literally anyone can come and become a right wing biggot.
Perniciosius,Stick that man's brain in a pigeon and it will fly backwards...
HSTsGhost-72,He is nothing but an opportunist.
Jump_Yossarian_,We really need to see this guy’s birth certificate.
night_dude,The oppo researchers in the NY Democratic Party should be sacked. Honestly. How the hell did this guy get through a whole campaign without this coming out?
waronxmas79,Crazy thing = scam artist and probable Russian plant
Anakin8108,My guess is he’s always been a pathological liar and doesn’t have any convictions or principles
LazeLinez,He never supported anything except his own enrichment. The guy is a psycho and always has been.
Turkeysocks,"Is it that odd? I do believe a number of current conservatives both in the media and in politics were at one point pretty liberal, but when they found out they couldn't make money off it, they went to the right."
deadbeef1a4,Grift is a hell of a drug
yukoncowbear47,"I don't think he actually believes his own shit, but I do wonder if he is being paid off by a foreign power to help destabilize the US"
s1mple-s1m0n,Basically one-upping Kyrsten Sinema
RobbyRock75,Why is he not being recalled by his district ?
sexymcluvin,Whose payroll is he on?
thejessica1983,I just wish this article was about Matt Gaetz
WackyBones510,Similar to people like Trump or Candice Owens. These people have no ideology just the grift path of least resistance.
Gorilla1969,"All these formerly hidden fun facts about ol' George here are sooo interesting. He's just a never-ending fount of delightful surprises!

P.S. Did you know that George Santos lassos rampaging bulls with his penis?"
LAESanford,"Yeah, he probably lied about all that too"
gruftwerk,"Damn, I never thought anyone on the republican team could do their makeup better than Trump, but I was wrong!"
RodIron1,Sir Lies a lot
MidKnightshade,"He didn’t change. He was always a liar. I wouldn’t be shocked if he was a straight up
Psychopath."
youngceb,"Previous Jobs Drag Artist…
Republicans: i think we can be a good match and we have a job offer for you."
ashlynne_stargaryen,Please can someone make a visual timeline of this man’s life and lies? It’s so complicated that I can’t understand the full history of when he showed up in politics and the claims he’s made. It’s too convoluted to comprehend. I need bullet points. Or drawrings.
Demosthenes3,Who is this guy? Like he could be some sleeper agent
OneCat6271,"so he's clearly either an opportunist, or a legit crazy person... or both"
PragmatismIsGod,This story doesn’t even seem real.
SingNightingale58,"“*Article I, Section 2, Clause 2: No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.*”

How did he get into congress if you need to be a U.S. citizen for at least 7 years?"
mcaDiscoVision,He wanted progressive policies for his own country.  He's happy to profit from destroying this one.
argonautdice3,George Santos is Glenn Greenwald?
enigphilo,"I've never seen him and Kyrsten Sinema in the same room together.

I'm not sayin', I'm just sayin'"
,"Which sounds more realistic?

1) hundreds and hundreds of people are all lying about one person, across continents

2) one person is lying A BUNCH."
ACE_C0ND0R,"I want to know if he's actually a US citizen, or if just lied about that like everything else."
BigDanG,"Are we sure that ""George Santos"" is not just a  Sacha Baron Cohen project at this point?"
Curl_of_the_Burl_,"This is literally full grift mode mask off. There isn't any hard evidence a guy like Dave Rubin switches to the right for money, but we all know it's true.

This grift has receipts."
Cameronbic,He goes where the grift is. Right now the maga crowd is so reactionary and blinded by the identity politics of the right that they don't notice their pockets being picked
MithranArkanere,The crazy theory of him being actually an actor working for Sasha Baron Cohen sounds less and less crazy every day.
musicalpants999,Probably just a grifter who saw where the suckers were at. People like him don't have any real political beliefs.
oilybarbour,"The quote that stood out to me is “he wanted to be famous, no matter what.” He got his wish."
ZeaDeKok,So he’s drag Trump?
neeesus,"Many people are actually left leaning and for policies that benefit many people, all people.  Until they move to the US, and are fed “patriotic” adjectives by the GOP.  


I.e.  my in laws."
ListenToThatSound,"It’s so nice to see the GOP, the party of ""facts and logic,” standing by a party member known to be so honest and truthful..."
cwn01,Republicans need to stop endorsing con-men and Yahoos. The Republican Party is looking like some kind of Clown Party.
sixty_cycles,It’s like bizarro Kyrsten Sinema… is he a democrat plant for revenge purposes?  /s?
macrocosm93,What if he's trying to infiltrate the enemy and do a double-cross and we all blew his cover?
condensermike,All the crazy that Russian money could buy.
Kastor161,"Yeah, these types of people stand for nothing.
They just shift into whatever the environment calls for."
dflame45,It's crazy to me how this happens. Like there was no real Republican that was interested in the office so they just went with this guy? Like how does it happen.
Ok-Yogurtcloset6205,Is he the Cousin of Ronnette Desantis from Florida???
TotesNotGreg_,"This guy is nuts. When I first saw stories of this dude I thought he looked off af. His look just didn’t fit. Like a skinwalker. And every story, including this one, has only affirmed those instincts more. Uncanny valley in the modern age."
m0rph2022,Has Glenn Greenwald gotten on the case yet being an investigative journalist who lives in Brazil???
rlvsdlvsml,Man just wanted some free healthcare for life
Bears_On_Stilts,"Ever read “Kiss of the Spider Woman?” A flamboyant gay drag queen in South America is joyfully apolitical even as the government is cracking down on people like him. This makes him an easy mark, and in return for little favors the fascists turn him into a double agent working for them instead."
COVID-19-4u,It’s easy to get elected if you just spew enough hate into the right people.
SandBumpkin69420,It would be so easy to be a right wing grifter
ooouroboros,He probably got introduced to Putin by Glenn Greenwald.
Kardest,If this whole thing turns out to be some piece of performance art. I will admit it's impressive.
youdidntreddit,He has to be friends with Glen Greenwald
Stealthy_Snow_Elf,"Capitalism consumes those with a weak mind. Makes sense Santos betrayed the left and gave in to the vast wealth the conservative movement offered. Dude was an opportunist, and the GOP gullible rich assholes. Perfect marriage"
khorijinn,They love how the crazies distract the libs so much that they'll keep electing them until it's the GCP.
formerfatboys,"Lauren Boebert was a sugar baby found through a casting website.

The whole plan is to make sure that tons of clown candidates break through.

It creates the narrative that all government is corrupt and we need a strong fascist to fix things. ""I mean, you don't see the Democrats doing anything to stop Santos or MTG or Boebert..."" they'll argue as they throw Santos out."
GraniteMtn,"""Crazy"" is more likely to be accepted by the Republican party, the Democrats would have turned him away."
dangshnizzle,"""this crazy thing"" being your standard political grifter?"
OreoDestroyer93,"*cough*

Money.

*cough*

Republicans and older people fall for grifts all the time.

Now younger people fall for both Democrat and Republican grifts.

YOUR WORKPLACE GOVES NO FUCKS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT, DEMOCRATS.

CONSERVATIVE MEDIA JUST WANTS YOUR MONEY, CONSERVATIVES, SO THEY TELL YOU THAT YOUR FEARS ABOUT IMMIGRANTS AND NON-STRAIGHT WHITE PEOPLE ARE RIGHT SO THAT YOU KEEP SPENDING MONEY ON THEIR NEWS NETWORKS.

And for Christ’s Sake, Elon Musk isn’t a visionary and a hero. He wants more money and he will side with whoever can make sure he gets the most."
Dick_M_Nixon,The Big Reveal:  He is Andy Kaufman.
H4ndelwithc4re,No it's a republicans so desperate to win a seat in any district that even crazy are on the menu.
TenshiS,"Like Trump and Musk, too. I guess it takes far less effort to gather and keep idiots as constituents"
_HAWK_,I feel at this point I need a docuseries about what the hell is going on with this guy.
LavaSquid,Duh. He followed the money. So did Trump. And Candice Owens.
Menanders-Bust,Money is a hell of a drug
Sheant,"Out of the many characteristics he has, his most outstanding feature is his ability to lie. So he turned to the party of liars."
pringlepingel,"It’s always the same shit. Some loser tried and failed to fit in with leftists because they had a shallow grasp on progressivism and were more interested with personal gain and were willing to abandon everything they claimed they stood for, all so that they can go grift and get money from conservatives making themselves out to be “one of the good ones”. Dave Rubin, Candace Owens, Ben Shapiro, George santos, Jimmy dore, the list goes on."
SusieG1111,"When they can no longer defend him in the face of the mudslide of lies, they say he's a ""leftist"". Lol omg seriously? He never went anywhere as a Democrat. This idiot is a con artist pure and simple. He got elected Ted as a GOP Rep. Those are the facts."
canon12,Just like most of the other GOP they look at their job as entertainment and personal gain.  It's all a game to them like going to Vegas.
ABearDream,What kind of art do they do?
Bloo_Dred,The American Dream.
notofthisworld76,Troll level: 1000
Comfortable-Letter64,And this is the Republican Party in a nutshell.  No background checks.  Just wants a seat in congress!
Otherwise-Froyo8485,This is just like new Mexican immigrants like Paola Ramos who was right-wing in Mexico yet when they come to the U.S. they are left wing.
egocrat,"I am all for Brazilian drag artists in general, even the mendacious kind, but it's rather shocking that one could become a MAGA congressman so easily. WTF, America."
TheRooj,He never left drag. He just changed his costume.
helptheplanet,The GOP is the way they are because of money. They have lost sight that they are actually mandated to run and improve the country. That has taken a back seat.
don_juicy,This is what happens when there are no consequences for lying politicians
Narodnik60,Conservatives wanted to drag the drag queens into their culture wars and they have exceeded expectations.
jeevesneverlied,This man saw how easy it is to get republicans to vote for you and grifted to victory Lolol
bart2019,"It's called ""grift"". They proclaim to be whatever brings them most benefit."
new-6reddit9,Santos is anything he feels people need to fit in. Heck Santos was awarded one Congressional Medal of Honor and just returned from a Mars exploration - all for sucking dick!
PEX70,"You know… I didn’t think anybody on this planet could lie more and better than Trump.  

Apparently George said “Hold my beer”"
TheThirteenthCylon,"If Republicans thought he was a liberal plant, perhaps then they'd dump him."
