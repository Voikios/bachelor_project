AsaraHS,"Hearing this is hilarious considering how many posts on both here and the discord were constantly shitting on people because ""he was just good"" lmfao"
OverlordZombwich,Squiddy888 is in the top 100 now.... lol.
YaBoyEvit,There's believable and then there's squiddy having 40% more kills than the second place player. Come on now. I wrote down their score 3556 one morning then the next morning they had 3780. 200+ kills in a 24 hour period even without accounting for sleep is insane.
Owlcifer,It only took countless posts on this sub for the devs to realise he was blatantly cheating? So much for their ‚Äúanti cheat‚Äù software. ü§£
Panic_Wise,Anti cheat software is a lot like a locked door your think no one can open it without the key till someone kick its in or picks the lock all just a false sense of security the real security is the repercussions from it
ihadthejewfro,"I have a theory its one of the devs testing the EAC and exploits, but here's to wishful thinking!"
Sors_Numine,Squiddy998 is the upcoming challenger for #1!
argulkumar,unpopular opinion: I don't think he was cheating.
