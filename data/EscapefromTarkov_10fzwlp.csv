ARabidDingo,"I VOIPed a guy today after he killed my buddy (and I killed his) basically going 'hey we dont have to fight, we can both walk away peacefully if you want, save our buddys gear and leave.'

He replied that nah, he preferred war. So I thanked him for being honest, we fought, and he lost."
Yeesh_,I never trust anyone. I’ve ran into some good scavs. Talk for a brief few and keep it going. Best for both of us. Don’t need them killing me and don’t need a PMC running up on us both
Mclovin10947,"once I fought as a solo a 2 man squad on interchange. killed the first. second started to talk to me. he was friendly, beg me to let him live. guided him to all the hotspots on interchange. let him take alle the good stuff. on the last hotspot he shot me in the back of my head without a word. 

really I dont care about the loot or my gear or the rubels. its all only pixels that I will easy gain back. but these betrayal hurt me personally out of the game. I was shocked how you can be such a peace of crap after I offered him so much kindness. Somehow it still hurts thinking about it :D

Never used VOIP again in this game since. I kill everything in this game I see."
Odd-Accountant3672,I ran into a shoreline and caught a naked pmc running  to the back tank area underneath sniper scav. Long story short I lit him up before he could duck into cover and heard him voiping quest this quest that let me live . So I did  but in return after he marked his tank he was cool with me killing him for my last pmc pistol kill. I was going to kill him anyway but letting him finish his quest made him happy.
Lazypole,"Had this couple days ago. Told a scav we'd team up and use extract together for the .25 rep, just wanted that + to do my quest. He agrees. He has a secret second friend who sneaks up and kills my friend, then tries to pull a gun. End up with a dead friend and two dead scavs and a literal full bag of loot I wanted to give them."
NotablyNugatory,"Last night me and two friends were all over woods as scavs trying to help one of them finish a fence quest. Find 4 flashlight or lasers in one raid and extract, and he got an UBGL M203. 

One of us is in Scav Village. One of us is in Old Saw. One of us is in Medical. The one in village asked some people for a light. One of them had one, and my buddy gave him a random suppressor for it. I asked someone in old saw the same thing. He laughed, said someone just asked his buddy that, and that he did not have any. I had mentioned we were willing to trade, but said cheers and have a good one. He ran me down by Eastern Rocks and asked if I had a Morphine. I tell him sadly no I have no morphine. My friend on discord in medical then says he has one, and I quickly relay the information. Excited, the other scav says “my friend needs one, he’s on the way. He has a light.” At this point it was the last light we needed. 

We met up on the hills between eastern rocks and old stations. Six scavs throwing each other different pieces of loot that all of us needed. It was a Scav Swap Meet for a couple minutes. One of the funniest little scav interactions I’ve had this wipe. 

Was very happy it worked out lol."

Puritania95,Steer clear of other Scavs when possible. Of one starts to linger then you should start being suspicious

CallMeDeutsch,"I can usually tell by someone's voice if they're genuine or not. Higher pitched voice/young sounding/feminine  = piece of shit that will betray you. If the VOIPer sounds like a joyless, life-beaten grown man like myself, then I will negotiate. 

Edit: I know that I'm generalizing and that there are probably exceptions, but I dont care. That's my formula."
snoozieboi,"Haha, I got betrayed exactly once by the nicest brit, and that was enough to avoid any offers of friendly stuff. I have barely played this wipe but I have already been in situations where people want to ""negotiate"" and insist I loot some dead bodies etc.

I just leave the area and decline any offer saying ""leeaaaaving"" hoping they hear me fade out, if viop does that on distance. I surprised a guy doing a item placing quest, he seriously sounded frustrated so I let him go too. I probably would have lost the duel anyway as I'm mostly hilariously shit."
Routine-Food,Yeah people who do that just show their inner neckbeard cunt personality
janksnake,"I agree. 

All the people who are saying ""it's just a game bro"" are definitely the kind of people who happily fuck people over in real life without a twinge of remorse.

Why are you doing it? because you can. 100% you also carry that philosophy into real world interactions."
Risktoxic,"Ive ran into a couple of ""chad"" pmcs claiming to be noob pmcs trying to do quests but then I peek around the corner and the dude is armed to the teeth. 

Its def just an entertaining factor for them and I wouldnt turn my back on scavs as a scav. Theres a reason why they are scavenging, its cause they are broke bois who cant kill other pmcs as pmcs cause they keep dying."
SirKane15,Trust nobody. Kill on sight.
HomerReplacesPeter,Tarkov player flabbergasted that people don't have morals in an online game
nupid_stoob,i met 3 scavs  once and they asked me to shoot their arms for a task. i said ok fine and shot their heads. it didnt end well for me but i killed 2 of them.  im not that gullible
TittieButt,"last night i betrayed my first scav, still feel dirty.

I found a tank battery, but bag wasn't big enough for it. So i go off searching for other player scavs. I bought another scavs backpack for a bublex and a waffle suppressor, and ran  back to the supply crate.

I returned to find a car battery, a couple toolsets dumped, and my tank battery gone. So i swooped up what i could and started gunning for extract to cut off this thicc boy. Welp caught him right at extract and made out with the tank battery that he carried all the way to extract.

Then he added me and started calling me all types of slurs before i can explain, so i don't feel as bad. Still sitting at 3.75 karma.

hiddencamela,"Betrayal scavs are players who don't have confidence in their gunplay, and thus need the advantage.  
I won't be changing my mind on that."

GardenofSalvation,That's all fine and dandy man I'll make sure to ponder the error of my ways as I'm looting your corpse
Jackpkmn,"Me and a friend of mine are duoing factory, just got done wiping the rest of the lobby and were rolling up on forklifts looking for the last PMC. We see a head poke up into the window of glass hallway and my friend lights it up and i start running into forklift to cut him off from running out safely. He voips ""please please no no no i just need to fix these control panels"" so my friend said alright we'll guard you. We held off the scavs trying to push him constantly since he was naked while he did it. When he stood up from fixing the second one my friend caps him immediately and as he's falling down to the ground he voips thank you so much."
fakemaleorgasm,"idk bruh, after being burned many times, me and my squaddies did develop a sort of a rule for encountering Scavs as PMC.

if there's just 1 of us, we usually don't let go, because it's too risky to have one eye on the gun, and the other on the scav at all times.

rule 1 - **knife out** \- if a Scav is looking for a friendly interaction with a PMC, he should understand that he is a high risk, low reward commodity for a PMC. if a Scav fails to pull his knife out seconds after being told so, he is dead. if he says that he has no friends and we see someone sneaking up on us during a random firefight, we shoot him and his potential friend. we really dodget a bullet several times, as it became evident that one would get friendly while other was ambushing.

especially when entering inventory in-raid, when you are solo, next to a scav. knife out (or even gun drop), turn around, stay in one place while i face you while i am in inventory.

hindsight, but enforcing this behavior will probably save you from a chunk of these incidents."
Sargash,"Well know that I'm never a traitor asshole. If someone wants to be friendly, make sure they know to not look at you, and to have their knives out. If they cant do that then headeyes them."
Oirad16,"I don't voip often but it's still worth the risk of being betrayed to have interesting player interactions. After playing this game for 6 years I've experienced everything there is to experience, and having a genuine unique interaction with a rando is far more memorable than just shooting another timmy. 

You can negotiate with other people without giving them your full 100% trust by keeping cover between you or not standing still.  
If I get betrayed and killed it's disappointing for a few minutes but at the end of the day you'd likely get tarkov'd next raid and lose your gear anyway and there's no need to get hung up about it."
neckbeardfedoras,"Omg I ran into a scav that was dying and coughing two wipes ago near tunnel exit stash on shoreline. I was on my PMC. I gave him healing stuff, threw him a graphics card and told him hope he gets out. He asked if I had any of some quest item he needed. I opened my inventory to check. He then voices he's sorry but has to do it and he shot me while I was checking.

I was in shock and now I don't help anyone."
lemonlixks,Noooo we need more trusting folk not less of them :( I'm sorry my guy.
Techxxnine,"No clue what servers you guys are playing on but 99% of times where I get the chance to talk to someone, we actually part ways or group together. So far only one guy tried to kill me still but failed."
add1ct3dd,"I came across a friendly PMC as a Scav on Streets, we rode the map together and he dropped me off at the extract. He could have killed me at any time and didn't, likewise with me. I tried to give him my name over VOIP as you can't greet but I guess he spelt it wrong or didn't want to add me in the end, RIP lol."
RancidRock,"This has happened to me enough times I just don't do friendly shit anymore. I will never stoop to their level, but if they say ""Friendly"" I say ""I'm not"" and nade em."
sanctionTheOrcs,"I think people who betray just makes game more interesting. Right now you don't really know what to expect from other pscav, there is this constant sensation that he might end up your raid prematurely. And now imagine if no one would betray, friendly fire disabled lol. There is no place for that sensation I described above and whole interaction with other pscav would be more dull. And I am telling you, irl, especially in Russia, betrayal would be very common theme. So enough with the salt, I know .. it hurts but its better."
Caine_Pain333,Yeah I agree it’s like either shoot me or at me. But whenever you act chill and then kill u fr fucked up like I’m tryna have some good interactions on a game
THENATHE,"My rule is that you can betray someone (verbal or not) in the first 10 seconds of interaction. If I go “yea I’m friendly” and then they peak the corner and I immediately shoot them, that’s not them sussing it out enough. If I start chatting and throwing shit on the ground I ain’t gonna turn on them at any point."
TheDutchDemon,"For whatever reason, I find a correlation between player level/experience and how they treat scavs...

I've been farming rep by trying to get 3 co-op extractions on each of the maps that allows it. To facilitate this, when I find a PMC I put my gun away, pull my knife out, and VOIP that I'm friendly. Most times I'll even toss my gun on the ground as a sign of good faith, but oddly enough most PMCs trust me when I try to do this and tell me to just keep it.

The easiest and best co-op extract I've had was with the highest level player I'd run into at level 52. AND he had another player scav he was escorting try to betray him and didn't take it out on me as well afterwards. Guy was an Altyn chad with an RSASS and when I asked if I could have the gun for Gunsmith since I couldn't do the barter he just stripped it and took out the bullet and gave me the gun. Great guy.

The worst ones have been low level PMCs who will spray me and fail while I try to VOIP that I'm friendly and then kill me after I they reload. I even had one instance where this happened with a 2-man where one of them stopped shooting while the other kept going and killed me.

Same thing with scavs on scavs...weirdest one was on Factory after I killed 2 naked PMCs, VOIPed about it laughing, went upstairs to get their tags and was immediately gunned down by a player scav. I tried to add him asking how he was so stupid, never got accepted. He was like level 10.

EDIT: So far I have not betrayed a PMC or been betrayed once the scav or PMC agreed to do the co-op."
Solaratov,"Have you considered not going into your inventory to give people your loot while you're on your free no-risk charity run?

Or, continuing to share loot and just understanding that getting dropped sometimes during your free no-risk charity run is simply bad luck?"
JayyMuro,It definitely portrays the type of person they are in real life.

keithstonee,This is why I hope for a real PvE mode soon.
StigmaINC,I team up with scav players on streets and hunt down pmcs. We usually die but take out a few haha.
aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,"The worst is that they honestly think they are some kind of genius for tricking you. Like you're only trying to pull that shit because you're going to respawn if it goes wrong. It's not some great battle tactic and trickery, it's just that some players genuinely aren't down bad and don't mind helping some little Timmy the shitter rat.

All the ones that have faked friendly squawk ""yeah bitch"" or something to that effect in their 15 year old squeaker voice after killing a defenseless man helping them."
californinja17,"I play solo, and learned not to trust anyone especially people acting friendly unless you know or play with them..

These people are the worst kind, maybe their real behaviors in real life too."
ColeKatsilas,"The high rep scav loadouts are so awesome that I take solace in knowing traitors won't experience good kits or chill peaceful scav runs. I spawned in on a scav the other day with a suppressed vepr hunter with an optic, level 3 armor, and a helmet."
GamingShorts-,If they start the fight then ask to quit never trust them ... they start it u end it :p
ALPHAfanitic,as a scav i always try n be a homie n help people out if i die i die oh well but as a PMC I'm too busy getting killed damn near off the rip to be friendly lmao
Jackal_Oddie,It’s this fake friendly shit that makes me wish for harder penalties for traitors
muatdks,"Not gonna lie I’ve had way too many funny ass scav encounters to care about anyone else’s loot. Plus, most of my stash is from running scav so there’s no point in fighting. Scav Rep Enjoyers on top"
xHughxJassx,"I ran into another scav player last night in Streets at ventilation extract with under 1 min to go. We both started extracting at the same time and we're talking friendly then he killed me with 1 sec left on the extract. 

Lost some good loot and 30 mins of my time spent + 20 mins waiting for another scav delay NOT because he wanted my gear (still sucks but understandable) but just because he wanted to be a jerk with 1 second left.

I hope Bholebandit get head eyes every time he plays after that bs. I haven't gotten that angry at another player in a long time."
yeetuscleatus,"Was by the scav tents as a scav at interchange, see a group of PMC’s and I hold out my knife swinging it asking them if they wanna take the coop extract. They both agree to it and we head towards the extract literally 20 steps away and one of em decides it’s be funny to mag dump me"
Electricshock7,I just continue being the decent human I am. I love giving other players presents.
Foreign_Wheel8190,It's okay. They will get hit by scav karma. You will see them less and most likely never. Again. It evens out over the wipe
buffchixdip,"A scav asked me 4 times over 20 minutes if I found a shotgun for him, I finally find a (kitted) guy who had one, I call him over, as I’m dropping it for him, he kills me and cleans up. I won’t help y’all anymore Lmao"
Kerstekind,"For this particular reason, I'm glad I played lots of RuneScape when I was a kid. Ever since someone promised to trim my full rune armour, I never trust a single stranger again.

shady531,Teamed up with a couple pmcs this wipe mid raid. Its been nice
Due_Resident_6989,"If I'm a Scav or PMC, I'm friendly until I'm shot at. Then it's on like donkey Kong! Being friendly has payed off for me a lot more than once."
swafromsteam,"I’m glad I’m the opposite, I’ll seek out people to be friends with. That’s how you get co-op extracts guys."
k1dsmoke,"This point in the wipe I very rarely get killed by player scavs, but you should never trust other PMCs."
Shiiznits,I think those kids already know they’re losers at life in general. Im they know they’re pathetic
chrisxtr3m3,"While I can whole-heartedly understand your position on this...I will say, I just finished a run on woods where I came across two PMCs (one who fired first shot on me) and I went on Voice Comms to let both know I didn't want to fight because I really fucking suck at this game and I just wanted to get to extract. I then booked it away from him (first guy) and I didn't get chased or shot at again (which I appreciated a ton).  and second guy I saw running away from mill as I was looting near sandbags and I just voiced to not shoot me please and that I was at sand bags and I suck ass and just want to make it to extract. He turned looked, saw me and continued on his way. I appreciated this a ton too. I was able to extract after being lost for 10minutes looking for northern roadblock. 

Thank you to those two PMCs."
GravelsNotAFood,"That's tame man. 

This game's community has some of the worst gamers I've ever seen in my life. People that'll sit idly by in extract for half an hour, just to kill a level 6 with his first good raid worth of gear. 

I've had people shoot near me to bait a shot. Had ppl beg me to shoot them because they're glitched, only to blow you away when you even think about it. Hackers, exploiters, the worst of the worst. It's all present, and thriving in Tarkov."
HereFortheLulls,I’ve faked being as scav as a PMC once and I felt terrible abusing the guy’s trust so now I don’t do it anymore.
IlluminatedBlu,"I've vioped with people where we basically set up a duel. 
""It ain't gotta be this way""

"" im only here for dorms kills""

"" fair enough, ill go far left you go by the door far right""

SoNElgen,"If you fake friendly. 

One of the core issues of this game is that people would rather play as a scav than as a their PMC."
the_obese_otter,"Last wipe, I was headed towards emercom extract on interchange, and there was someone camping extract. I saw another player scav hiding until he could make a run for it, so I asked if he wanted to clear it together. 

He agreed saying he wanted to get out with what he had. So I lead and clear everything, the camper had extracted (only about 1 minute left), and the player scav and I start extracting.

 I shit you not, this wack ass shoots me in the back of the head with less than a sec on the extract timer. I messaged him after, and he said he thought it was funny, and that he didn't even get to loot what I had as he extracted right when he shit me. Like dude, what about that is funny? Just toxic af.

 I'll never understand people getting joy out of being a dick to others. Completely lame basement dweller shit."
Glympse_TV,There was another player scav on factory standing in the doorway of the 1st floor office so I couldn't get out. He told me to drop my bag so I just shot him in the head took the rep hit.
Jimmy_Bonez,What ever happened to them adding PMC karma for those who kill their own team?
roflwafflelawl,"Yeah I'd rather someone just not be friendly and kill me on the spot. The fact that they voip, lie to you, then get you when your pants is down is just dirty. 

Eventually there's going to be enough Scav players who are sick and tired of getting betrayed like this that the majority are going to KoS, which just brings us back to the pre-voip days. 





Wow I just reread what I typed and could see how ""carebear"" it could sound lol. But hey, betrayals suck ass and if anything Scavs should ALWAYS be teaming up to take on Players, Raiders, and bosses, or whatever doesn't lowwe Scav karma (honestly don't really remember)."
DopeyLo420,"I scav’d into Interchange with 39 min left. Ran into a clearly identifiable PMC inside Oli who said “na bro I’m a scav I killed a player”. Whatever. I had a 153 with 7mm and he always ran in front of me. Never once did I shoot. We get to Goshan I said “he bro, I know you’re a PMC, you left your armband on. Let’s take PMC/scav extract.” He said cool, I have a buddy coming. And proceeded to drop me stuff. VOIP’d that he had a buddy coming and not to kill him. I said cool, I was in my inventory anyways. His buddy swings the corner I hear the guy I was with say “he’s right there” and I was immediately blasted by an m4. Dudes so pathetic he couldn’t even get legit scav kills he needed the hand out I guess 🤣🤷🏻‍♂️"
LargeSticker,It’s a shame more people don’t voip. The fake friendlies really ruin a big part of the experience.
Invaliedusername,Same type a person that doesn’t put their shopping cart back.
Teyakko,"To be honest, I just feel sorry for the people that betray others. It’s so much fun just meeting a random scav player and hitting it off. 

Like just today, showed a new player a loot run on streets, we killed a pretty geared player and I told him to get the stuff and keep it. 

Imagine if the homie shot me in the back of the head first chance he got. Imagine if I did it. I understand killing everything, but if you fake friendly, you don’t want the thrill of the fight. You just want pixel-money, and I feel bad for you lol"
Vubor,"I try to do the coop extracts as a scav and boy is it hard. I even run with my meele through interchange, first guy nearly doomed me but he went like WTF? where is your weapon and all good he helped me heal me up etc, then 2 of his mates came and we went to coop extract. They even invited me to discord for more pmc runs. (sorry first guy I had your name but I somehow mixed it up! but thanks for not killing me! I know your friend was EG-Peacekeeper.)

&#x200B;

Next Run I tried the same heard a pmc, I said hello, he came around the corner blasting like there is no tomorrow I yell in my mic NONONONONO he continued his fire and I died.  I am one of those friendly scavs on coop maps that just wanna do that shit. Fuck you on customs by the way, no coop extract=open fire! :D"

They then began to beg not to fight and just complain about us being there. We finished up and attempted to push them, they were begging not to fight and they just needed to do a task there. We decided to take our leave and not moments later I had a black leg as they attempted to come up behind us."
R0bbieB,"I have had 2 scav runs this wipe where I wasn't deleted by pmc's whilst wanting to coop extract. I've also been killed by so many scavs trusting them to not kill me but hey just the way of life, the nice people get taken advantage of"

MortVader,I came to this conclusion 1 or 2 months after they implemented voip. Never trusted ANY voicer since. I just use their voice to locate them. I never answer.
dabman694201337,This is why I shoot on sight. I may voice comm during the fight to troll you but that’s about it
an0nym0ose,"Nahhhhh if you get bamboozled it's on you. I've never, *ever* understood the salt from getting talked into handing over your loot and loadout.  Maybe it's because I came from DayZ, where half of the PvP happens in your mic, but this ""omg u r bad if u say ur nice then shoot me :("" is little kid shit.

Psychological-Monk30,"The amount of time this happen when you try to get someone friendly to use coop extract is crazy. Some MF really struggle to get kill and when they see this kind of opportunity they jump on it. 

I used to play with a guy like that and he was legit happy every time he was able to betray a random player i was making friend with even if they only had a knife and he had no PMC kill quest to do, you could hear the happiness in his voice as if it was an achievement  ... spoiler alert this guy struggle to do barely 1 kill legit."
Agent0061,People act like cooperation is so crazy in this game when there are coop extracts and 5 man teams running around
AWoodsJSU,"Love this thread. Guy gets shit on for being too trusting, complains to the people betraying him, attacks those who tell him he's overreacting by going through their account and making personal digs. This thread has it all. 

OP, I'm sorry you got killed and feel this way. I personally like to help someone until the inevitable funniest moment I could betray them possible. If there really isn't and I'd seem like just a douche for no reason, we extract together. 

My mentor is @stimpee , I recommend you go watch his videos. 

P.S. load back in and try again, all you can do."

Liisn,"As much as I agree with you, going on social media to complain about it also portrays what type of person you are.

You let your guard down. You willingly trusted another without any signs. This probably isn't the first time it happened, and you still allowed it to happen. You allowed this to happen.

Tarkov. The great teacher, the magnanimous exampler, and the hard giver(gasm) we all need in our lives."
McMonkeyMeanie,"It’s just a strategy to out smart your opponent, VOIP adds another layer on to this game, you can antagonize people to push you by calling them a pussy or trick them into thinking your friendly. At the end of the day the game is all about the loot. You never played tarkov without VOIP so you wouldn’t understand the kill or be killed mentality pre VOIP. Go play something casual like COD if you wanna play a game for fun"

Never-Shower,"I'm not a friendly player but I never pretend to be, I think that's kind of scummy. I make it really clear from the moment I see someone that it's on.

However assuming that this has anything to do with the other player's personality is probably too much. A lot of people do scummy tactics in-game but they're perfectly decent people IRL. The friend that introduced me to this game used to exfil camp at emercon and enjoy it - people would often call him coward, pussy etc, but he's a first responder. What you do in a game does not reflect who you are IRL (unless you're scamming people for IRL money)."
fresh_fish_23,Some days ago I was escorting 2 my Timmy Friends  to do some quests in custom when i heard someone over the wall between ruaf and crackhouse. I hit him twice and threw a grenade at him then he asked me if he could extract at ruaf because he was questing. So I told him to wait 10 seconds so we could go away and let him extract free. I really felt good about this. And I hope there are more people to do things like that

Ziji,If you trust anyone you deserve to be shot. It's why I don't use VOIP at all. Just shoot on sight.
loganlocked,Shows you just how many players are legitimate psychopaths
madhatter275,"Shit.  Guys do this? 

I was hitting a last cache on my way to extract on interchange and a guy pops out and I blast him as he screams Noooooo!  He was a looted out scav doing the same thing as me on the way to extract.  Like mf, stay hidden and say something cool and I’ll drop something for you and not blast you.  You pop up like a PMC you gonna get blasted like one."
Critical_Quick,Lmao someone's mad he got played.
leBattlePig,Cry baby
psychedelicstairway4,Cry is free
ABruisedBanana,"Cry more, you little bitch."
Anirus,"do this all the time, its the funniest thing ever"
Lenevov,This is exactly how I felt when I was betrayed in the DayZ mod for Arma back in 2012. If it’s your first time being betrayed I can understand the frustration but you get used to it.
flomeista,"don't be so trusting, keep one eye on them at all times"
thebski,Unfortunately you learn not to trust anyone in this game.
EnglishRevenger,Approximately 1 hour into the dayz arma 2 mod I learned this lesson about a decade ago. It’s not a fun one to learn lol
Iteroparous,"Trust no one bud, use your instinct and judge based on if they sound friendly, best advice I can give. I have 4K hours and this works well."
Defuzzygamer,It's a strategy nonetheless. It's a cunty one but that's also subjective. Those who do this often probably think it's easy loot and xp and believe they're smart for doing it. It all depends on what you want to achieve out of playing the game.
Whatssun65,I was posted up at backpack extract on interchange today trying to rat it up and finish a weekly survive quest and while waiting for the 7 minute mark I had a little timmy walk up right on top of me and had no choice but to put him down. He had a tool kit that he probably needed for a quest and I felt super bad. He probably thinks I’m extract camping scum but it was just unfortunate timing. 30 more seconds and I would have been long gone.
Copperdoo62,"Welcome to tarkov, i learned my lesson on dayz years ago. Trust no one."
drewroxx,Idk it fits into the game story to be like that if you are being immersive.
HighRevolver,Depends. If this was scav on scav then yes. But if you were pmc? Entirely on you
AllouttaRum,Any friendlies in Cherno?
truupR,Jokes on you. I get head eyes'd by a scav regardless if I'm friendly or not!
Aspivio,Hahahahah this is my favorite thing to do get owned
_rockethat_,Life.
WeepingAngelTears,I don't do this on my scav but I love asking pscavs on factory if they want to do the PMC extract (a.k.a. 8.5mm buckshot to the eyes.)
electronicfixdude,If i run a scav i dont even mind being friendly to scavs. But as a scav im messing every pmc on sight. As a pmc im messing everything thats not my team. Just rules of engagement in these tarkovian streets.
komfyrion,"In LARP it's often the case that lying and betrayal can get really annoying and stupid because you rarely know someone well enough and their character well enough to make a real judgment about what they are saying. It's not easy to act as someone who is trying to lie and deceive, either. 

That, combined with the fact that in LARP people are always interested in taking part in interactions, leads to a lot of bad roleplay situations where people fall for really lame types of deception and roguery. If you want to be a bandit character that kills people and steals their coins it's not exactly hard to find some new players at the LARP and ask if they want to join you on an adventure, only to lead them into an ambush. 

Thus, a lot of LARP games will have some kind of rules against power gaming like that. You can play a character who is a dirtbag, but you should be a dirtbag in the game, not IRL (which you are if you kill someone in a shitty low effort way, thereby denying them from playing the game).

I think video games with some level of ""perma"" death and/or RP (DayZ is a better example than Tarkov, but still) face some of the same struggles, and with public servers where players rarely meet again you are naturally going to have somewhat of a hard time agreeing on the kind of unwritten and written rules that ultimately create a better gameplay experience. IRL LARP groups or dedicated RP servers in games such as DayZ can deal with this more gracefully.

I would argue that it's significantly harder to handle these things online since it's easy to see pixels and numbers instead of fellow people when engaging with other people online, and in more sandboxy games we often fail to consider that there is a co-dependence in having a good gameplay experience. In addition, online games often have ways to exploit quirks in the game to your own advantage, further exacerbating the potential impact of power gaming. 

The changes to the unwritten rules in the community will be interesting to observe as Tarkov moves more in the direction of the MMORPG vision with things like PMC factions."
Fazgo,Welcome to Tarkov
razor_sabre,I’ve been betrayed too many times to trust pmcs. Oddly I’ve had super friendly scavs this wipe lol
TheBigZamboni85,"This is why I trust nobody on a scav run. If I don't have anything of great value fine whatever, shoot me and take my shit. If I have anything of value or quest items, however, I'll shoot any motherfucker that looks at my the wrong way. Scav karma be damned I'll take a minus 0.03 Rep hit for a GPU"
Son-of-Tanavast,"General rule I've found is we can be ""friendly"" up until we extract together. After that first raid it's usually an invite to discord, and then the trust is mostly there"
birrk1,I do this all the time. I’ve gotten so much loot that way yiha
Trick_College2491,When I’m a PMC I never trust anyone anymore. I’ve lost too much and been betrayed too many times. When running PMC best to just kill everyone on the spot.
goliath-og-2021,Don’t hate the player hate the game
WoodeusPrime,"I would say that I feel like this about 93% of the time. 

Then I run another scav and make a friend and I have to have a meeting with myself and say ""Well its not so bad I guess"""
paulfunyan,"This happened to me last wipe. Helped some dude in Reserve bunker doing his bunker part 2 quest and showed him all the loot spawns so he could have them (I was just there looking for raiders for quest) and when I went into my inventory to drop him something he shot me in the head.

I assume he thought the shitty Caiman I was wearing was worth something because otherwise I just had like mmac + ump or something, but I thought ""what the hell, let's see where this guy ends up"".

He was level 20 when he killed me. He made it to level 21 in the wipe. The people who do this are just.. bad, lol. It's not very efficient and IMO it just shows that some people have absolutely no clue how to acquire gear/progress."
thathomelessguy,You can usually tell someone’s intentions by their replies/immediate actions. It’s generally pretty easy to read people imo. Just have to be aware
cornpeeker,"Some random literally gunned down my teammate, didn't know we were teaming and then tried to play friendly with me. 

So anyways I started blastin"
self_loathing_ham,In my experience your most vulnerable as a player scav to get killed by other player scavs if you are near PMC bodies. Most player scavs will remain friendly or indifferent in most scenarios but a lot of people drop any concern for scav karma when there is potential PMC loot on the table.
SneedDeez,"It's give and take dude. I'm friendly most of the time, but I don't stick around to chat. I just say I'm not interested and run in the opposite direction. I wouldn't ever let my guard down at close range."
bigred1978,"I wish they'd let you give a ""mark"" to the person that shot you after you died in the game.  They tell you who already but it would be good to actually ""rate"" them.  Like if someone actually did that you could give them a either downvote or perhaps an actual ""backstabber"", or other ""mark"" (badge) to add to their personal records."
c235k,Should've shot them first
TheAndyPV,"I have never ever trusted anyone that says they are friendly, i immediately shoot on sight everyone i see, on my PMC of course. I trusted one guy once and he tried to rat me with an pm. Never again."
ChuChuChuva,"You must be the guy I ran into in Customs yesterday.
My trigger finger slipped! Sorry!
🤣"
PainEverlasting,carl420 on interchange you prick
Icy_Cost6514,This is such facts being spoken.
flatspotting,never get trust trapped. never trust anyone.
rm968211,Welcome to tarkov. Trust nobody
SuicidalTorrent,Chill bro.
Joey-S-,I think I've had 1 friendly encounter ever whether it be as a pmc or scav and that was me showing mercy to someone wanting to just do some quests who was a newbie. Most of the time I try to ask to be let through and it always results in one of us getting murdered because they decide to ignore and just attack. Don't get me started on the amount of times I've been betrayed as a scav.
NemoSHill,"I've died one time because I trusted another guy that shot me and then offered me healing when I told him about my quest, only to shoot me while I was healing healing, is that his fault? No lol I was stupid enough to trust him and realized I should have shot him while he was dropping me healing but I wasn't thinking straight since I was stressed about my Gas An. 

I understood why he did it cause he had a pistol only and was probably on Skiers pistol quest, and I can't blame him for it, did it make me salty? Yeah sure but it's only my fault. He 1v1 me in mental warfare and won, if you're using those strategies I'm not blaming you, I'd blame the people that falls for it cause they allow you to keep doing it and getting away with it (like myself).  

Can't say I agree with your statement about people having personal issues for bamboozling someone in a video game tho, but if you honestly think that I'm not gonna try change your opinion. It just sounds more like a salty post death rant.  

It's a free for all game with no rules, do what you must to get by, I respect all strategies and methods (except cheating/hacking)"
AnimationOverlord,It’s an asshole move but in the end those players are gonna be the winners.
guberNailer,"Interchange is a literal warzone, kill or be killed"
datreko,"VOIP has been around enough time that if you pay attention most times you can tell by someones voice what their intention is. Most people are cautious and even scared, or they are asking for some quest item. But if someone sounds excited most likely he is just waiting for the opportunity to head eyes you from behind.

Most times if someone doesn't answer my VOIP and they start to follow me and aiming at me I just black one of their legs and go on my way."
Different-Ebb-2285,"I swear to God I friend request almost every person that does this to me and ask them wtf is wrong with them. Do they think it's funny? Are they impressed with themselves? The only thing I've come up with is they're straight douchebags with no power or morals in their personal life, so killing someone whose trying to be friendly either gives them some sort of good feeling/power or they're a scumbag at heart with no morals. I know were talking about videogames but it honestly makes me question the world we live in. How can you act friendly to someone and then kill them just for a little extra loot after you gave them your word. I would feel so dirty if I did that to people, yet people do it to me constantly. Makes me wish I could see these little fucks in real life just so I could scare the fuck out of them. I'm 6'4 235lb... I would be considered the person who could bully anyone in real life yet I'm the one who gets bullied by these people in tarkov because I try being nice and they take advantage. That's why I go back to thinking they must be little douchebags with zero power or zero morals because a real man doesn't give someone their word to just go back on it and kill someone whose being nice to them. It's straight up filthy.. And if you're one of those people, you should recognize what it says about you as a person..."
Friendly_Deathknight,"Don't trust people, but I'm sure the people doing this are doing it because all they get otherwise is head eyes by scavs, and have to backstabbing or cheat to maintain their K/D"
WhichSeaworthiness49,"If you trust anyone in Tarkov, you deserve the betrayal that’s coming*

Fixed your post"
Byron_Who,"I haven't played ""seriously"" in like 6 wipes but this shit never changes lol."
Less-Boysenberry-161,Yeah usually nice to other scavs I even felt bad because someone though I was going to shoot them in the head because I was offering stuff to them even gave one a level 5 armor since I don’t really like wearing armor I’m a light built person but end of the story hope dude made it out with the gear
Flaky_Bath_7007,Tarkov is a game  you gotta do what you gotta do if faking friendly to get outa a situation and kill the guy is what you gotta do it's what you gotta do
Carlsgonefishing,"Wow been a while since I've seen this posted.

Sorry you lost your loot lol"
WarmanreaperX,"I don't think people realize Scav and Pmc are enemies Lol.. even if the coop extracts are available, the scav has infinitely more to gain from killing you than cooperating with you. ( as reflects fence rep.. u get like 3 runs worth of rep for killing pmcs, more if u kill multiple tmk) I personally don't scum, but people act like it's new or disgusting.. scavs aren't friends, they're opportunists. (Sure coops give extracts/rep too but they're are situation and have extremely trashy returns)"
JavenatoR,"So far I’ve had good experiences as Scav with other Scavs, but when I am a PMC it’s shoot on site. I tried talking to other PMCs and player Scavs maybe 20 times and every time it ends in betrayal, even if I have nothing but a pistol and a paca."
General_Gopnik27,"Yeah, 4 wipes in I’ve learned that being friendly doesn’t work 9/10 times. There’s still the occasional good experience but so far I’ve only 1 this wipe."
WarlanceLP,"this is why 'friendly' in my eyes means we both just walk away, preferably without entering each other's line of sight."
chudds007,"I hate this, I try and be the FRIENDLIEST scav and player all the time. SOLO I AM and yet people take this game too the heart lol lame a** mofos but help me help you I say."
thehadgehawg,"The trick is to ask if they are friendly, and then say ""I'm not"" when they come out having *assumed* you are. Always get the other person to say they are friendly if you yourself are friendly. If they never say it, expect battle."
SelfishTsundere,"Look, it’s not like I don’t agree with what you’re saying, honor is good and all. But you are well aware of how people act in this game, and just because they do it in game doesn’t mean they also pull this shit in real life. This kind of behavior comes with the territory. You can either go on Reddit and complain about how other players who do this have no honor or you can adapt and find your own ways around it. 

Me personally, I’m down to share loot, negotiate or trade with other players. But you bet your ass that I have your head pre-aimed and ready to tab out of inventory to shoot at any time if the guy so much as even twitches. 

Now if you are complaining about someone being racist and toxic over VOIP, then that’s a different story."
NightF117,"I feel like ppl barely use Voip on EU servers. So many times, I was lit and unable to proceed with the raid (like a pistol run with barely any meds) and I try to tell the guy : bruh I'm f**ked, I'll get to 125m and enjoy your SbiH kill, or a name kill or whatever. Never add anyone listening. 
I get the feeling of distrust and all. But even for co-op extracts, its painful. I have made 1 or 2 coop extracts since the implementation of voip."
AdNew6926,or just say hi and move on dont try and be every scavs friend
AchokingVictim,"Not worth fucking up the vehicle extracts and hideout junkbox imo, best to just not scav if you're gonna go postal"
HalloHallo69,"Hopefully PMC karma will help with this like scav karma did, I'd love to see tarkov be not kill on sight 100% of the time"
PapiSlayerGTX,"One of the games that converted me to PC gaming when I was a kid was the DayZ mod. I learned veeeery early on that you never trusted a soul. Thankfully scav rep has made a lot of people work together in my experience, but as for PMC play you will never catch me being friendly."
xbepox,"I've had tons of great VOIP interactions this wipe but I'm also always initiating and making them work on MY terms. You can usually tell what kind of player they are from their gear/movement and how they respond to you; a lot of times I simply tell them go the other way if you want to live but there's been plenty of new players I've helped out with quests and hooked up with some gear I didnt need.

Only had a few scav betrayals when I was loaded with PMC gear (can't blame them) and yet to have anyone betray me on PMC."
Flimsy_Sheepherder_3,So my take is a bit jaded. Iv been attacked my trator scabs running in packs alot recently and ye it sucks but iv met friendly scavs just looking for useful loot and yes iv given items of I have them and am not in dire need for them (espashaly new players or ppl only just getting back in to the game). Its a risk you take or dont in the end. Personally I have a blast hunting trator scavs but it's hard to tell sometimes. I'd say take every one with a pinch of salt and take precautions.
alex_german,This is all just training for the real apocalypse that’s starting later this year.
SnooPickles436,"Still early in the wipe, once those players start destroying their rep. they play less and good scavs play more. theirs allways posts like this early wipe. it gets better"
rootedoak,"Actually, the game keeps track of these stats and alters the scav targeting based on your bad boy score."
Hydra138,And the cycle continues.
iiijjiii,I make sure to kill every player scav I see gotta get their juicy loot
Simple-Strategy-3320,Rust taught me to never trust anyone for any amount of time
Sintack,"I'm to the point where if I am a player scav and I clearly have loot on me (like as in you can see I've looted a player or rogue) I will shoot you in the face if you come near me. I've been killed too many times being friendly this wipe. But on the same hand it's a dog eat dog world in Tarkov, technically nobody is friendly unless you're grouped with them."
WhiteLightWarrior,Sometimes i follow them a bit and run around making it seem like im looting with them then cap em.  If they talk in game i never kill.
nisaar,"If I end up finding items that players get stuck on like gas an and flash drive while on my scav I try to find other pscavs to drop them for, it’s pretty rare that I find any other players that actually need the items but I always ask if they are looking for anything find in raid for dailies etc"
quitesohorrible,"I've only met friendly scavs on interchange. People often give out requested items.

Only been killed by another scav while looting in Woods. Guess it was a new player. He sneaked up on me and said ""Surprise mother fucker"" before he shot me in the back. I just thought what an idiot ruining his rep for killing a very badly geared fresh scav. 

I rather die as a scav than lose rep and if I get something really good just extract safely ASAP."
Relevant_Parsnip_479,I've played enough rust to know not to trust anyone.
kingzechs12,I trust people to an extent. If I aint got shit idc as much and if we voice comm or w.e I'm cool just don't follow me n keep distance and I'll do rhe same. But if I got some raider or pmc gear and I look it I def don't let anyone get close kos
Epikz1,"In the last week of Tarkov I've had some interesting encounters.

Scav run Light house: My friend and I run up on 2 PMC's, we VOIP and decide to take the joint extract and help each other loot and kill all the way to extract.

Scav run Lighthouse: I spawn in with nothing in the last 10 mins. I help a PScav slaughter an unfriendly PMC and then another PScav dumps his whole rouge kit to me and runs off into the horizon.

Scav run Lighthouse: A very wary Pscav gets shot and thinks it is me. I offer him a Flash Drive. He nopes the fuck outta there and I head to extract and get attacked by the PMC camping Industrial Zone Gates. VOG nade him to find out hes a LVL 45 with Silenced Mosin and then extract.

My two friends on a PMC on Interchange: Hooked up with 8 Pscavs and took the Joint extract."
HoodPopeUno,"yea, my rule of thumb is that say ""hello do you need anything?"" chat a bit more if need be, be chill make jokes and move around a bit more looking for loot but if they keep following me then its headshot time from me to them"
JustMelloh,I'm this guy AMA.
porridge_in_my_bum,"You got Tarkov’d so hard, the cycle of violence only continues"
RichHedge,"i trust as a scav, but when im a pmc its either death for them or death for me"
almosthighenough,"Yeah this is really shitty behavior and I personally think being sneaky and shitty is kind of douchy but it is just a game. That said, I fought this guy in woods and he was winning and said we don't have to fight, and I was fine with that and agreed cause I was boutta be dead anyway. He went and looted or something, I went in a shed to heal my wounds. He came back as I was finishing healing and killed me. I don't blame him. I would have died if we fought anyway so at least I got the healing xp. And I wasn't trying to kill him but I didn't leave right away, cause I couldn't cause I had to heal, so I might have looked suspicious to him still chilling there. Although he knew I was healing since he could clearly hear it. Anyway, I still thought it was a fun exchange and don't really consider that shitty cause like he did call a truce for a bit and I got healing xp and I could have like focused on booking it. 


Had another raid that day fighting around some houses on woods again (was getting scav kills there that day) and some dude is trying to come around a corner and is talking some friendly shit about peeking and how hes gonna kill me and I had an sks and my first 2 shots I was aiming in close quarters and probably both missed or hit limbs. I got hit and was damaged and was gonna die and remembered I can fire a lot faster without aiming with the sks. So just unloaded a few shots off really fast and somehow hit him in the head as he was talking shit. It felt so good and was so fun, even if it was basically a lucky kill on my part. 


The fact that it makes you feel so strongly though is kind of a good sign. It means you're invested in the game and really enjoy the range of emotions it provides. I wouldn't personally lie about killing someone or calling a truce, and it is frustrating, but it's part of the game and VOIP. It's also really cool when you can work together or be cool or help someone out with healing or quests or something that makes it worth it to me to basically trust people. Also most people are generally good and just as bad and scared as I am so really most people don't betray you. It just feels extra bad when they do. 


But I get it. Pretty sure I've complained about the exact same thing before on reddit and was so enraged. I think it says a lot about you as a person to lie and betray someone. Then again it is a video game and isn't that serious. But some people just like causing pain to others. I am super busy now so am taking this wipe a lot less seriously and am still having fun. Plus if I'm betrayed, there's only a 30% chance I'd have survived the raid anyway, so maybe I shouldn't suck."
TaylorPlayed,I like trying to be friendly with other Pmcs but when I try it I come in with the expectation that I’ll be fucked over.  Don’t think it’s happened to me more than once or twice and I’ve had quite a few successful raids that way.
XBL_Fede,"You’re just terribly unlucky. Most of the VOIP encounters I have as a scav (and even PMC) are friendly, and I’m talking 95%+ of the time. That’s just my experience though, and I could be the one who’s lucky."
tryin_to_make_u_mad,I'm still mad about this. Last wipe I found someone on factory blacking out whatever tier 6 it is and I offered to help. We went to an extract I shot him while he was in his inventory/medding. And soon as he said he it was good he shot me. Not even a thanks
Solendor,"No joke. A guy VoIPed me, I answered with scav lines. Asked if I had a mic, he saw me shake No and then executed me after being friendly for a min...."
straight_lurkin,">Head eyes by scav

Hey that's my pmc name :D"
Bluekestral,What if we play as a BEAR and voice line player scavs and they fall for it then you kill them when they let their guard down?
PhatRaindrop,"My very first raid ever was on streets, I walked past a guy and asked for directions because I was lost. I told him this is my first time playing he said oh cool and he offered to show me to extraction. He asked if I needed a gun and I said sure. He dropped it on the ground and when I bent down to pick it up he shoots me in the back of the head.
Awesome welcoming to the community"
Joshrose629,Facts bro
