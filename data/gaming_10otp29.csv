cosmernaut420,"Finding nothing but enemies and strife may point you in the right direction, but treasure and secrets are always in the wrong direction."
TiredHappyDad,"Yup I hate exploring and accidentally going the way I was supposed to. Especially if it opens a cutscene and I can't go back.

Edit: so glad I made this comment. People have mentioned a few games on my list that I know to watch out for now. Lol"
xXDireLegendXx,Nothing gets me more annoyed than when I accidentally go the way I‚Äôm supposed to lol
zillskillnillfrill,Loot always takes precedence
JubbaTheHott,I love the dead space waypoint system. I wish every game had it and I‚Äôve been saying so ever since it first came out.
Walrus_Morj,"I HATE when there is a crossroad and you go to explore every dead end, but it happens to be too long, so you consider it the right way, then you go another way, which is the right one, then cutscene starts, you fall down and can't go back and loot another way. Screw you, Callisto Protocol (anyway I enjoy the game so far)"
Firvulag,In this case both paths were the correct way but yes.
Amorphia1618,One of the best UX ever.
TXEEXT,"All this year playing final fantasy make me do this , you probably gonna miss some important key item for the best weapon 8n the game"
FurryCurry,Run left at the start of every 2D platformer because you just never know!
datsadpotato,One of the universal unspoken rules of gaming
C__T__P,"In every other game: yes

In a horror game: no"
DonnerMcgregor,"In LOU2 I find the correct path, and then search every other building looking for supplements and supplies"
foundmonster,"Yes, this is a perfect example of the excitement and value of video games - exploration."
Lunar_Lunacy_Stuff,This really came back to haunt me in the Botany area.
Wuntoothrie,"Yeah, if you follow the objective path you miss all the secrets, loot, easter eggs, and lore."
WraithCadmus,"~~Yes, and always carry a spare Power Node for supply closets, you'll make back what you spend.~~

Dead Space's UI is a masterpiece, please enjoy [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXGWJRV1Zoc) on why they did what they did and some of the technical implementations.

EDIT: Apparently they got ride of Node closets."
CIMARUTA,Almost like this is what the devs intended... curious
Saucyminator,You're kidding me.. I've been opening the Inventory -> Map to see where I'm going. I'm an idiot.
WhatisLiamfucktrump,I need ammo mother fucker I wasted it all on figuring out that I can‚Äôt kill the hunter
NVBSCVN92,"Of course. Loot first, objective second. In case you get locked out"
ADHDavidThoreau,"Play-through 1: medium difficulty, focus on the main objectives and figure out the gameplay.

Play-through 2: highest difficulty, leave no stone unturned, skip all cutscenes."
Golett03,"An ""exploration"" setting would be good. It tells you when you're going the right direction and warns you if you're about to do something that you can't go back from. Then it tells you everything you missed in the area you can't return to"
xiosy,Imagine this game with a Ubisoft UI would completely destroy the immersion
solidpeyo,And the funny thing in this game you would have had to go the other next so there is no point in doing that
Puncredible,That's how you get the Endorphins. Finding stuff along a singular path wouldn't be nearly as gratifying as going along an optional path.
Lucky_Cookie515,Thats the Law Of Gaming!
hitma-n,I missed exploration opportunity twice like this in the last of us 2 because I thought i was supposed to go the other way but went the other way and it turned out to be the way I was supposed to go and now I can‚Äôt go back because apparently ellie jumped from a high platform and now is unable to climb back up.
Warlordrex5,"Friend/sibling backseat gaming you:


‚ÄúWrong way jackass.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut loot!‚Äù
‚ÄúGood point.‚Äù"
GavrielBA,"I love my whole life like that....

Most family are not very happy. Some people think it's very cool.

Thank you video games!"
totallylegitnesss,"Best way to play games, this one specifically"
GabrielGamingAngel,My greed is greater than my fear
TreeTalk,What if the next room is a boss that destroys the entire ship and I miss a rare weapon or even worse.. an unlockable character!!
Xeon713,This is the way.
BenSolace,"God of War: Ragnarok seems to poke fun at this all the time.  Every time you go the ""wrong way"" something is usually said by one of the companion characters, to which loot is used as the reason."
pixelTirpitz,Facebook memes <3
RLD-Kemy,"You can explore the Ishimura like you explore the police station in Resident Evil 2 Remake.

It's great because you can go to the medical bay or anywhere else already explored, even if you are at chapter 7 or 10 in the story."
Rizenstrom,"Yeah my favorite thing about objective markers is knowing where *not* to go until I've looked everywhere else. I know some people don't like ""hand holding"" but I hate accidentally missing something because I went the right way and can't go back."
Doctor_Eternal_65,Gotta get that hidden lootüòÅ
badbunnyarmy,"Literally been me the whole time, then you realize that you were completing the objectives out of order"
Piyush3000,"Did this in God of War Ragnarok, boy says ""this way"", I say ""I think I'll go that way"""
krakenmyboy,Reminds me of Fallout. Can't miss out on all those valuable glues and spoons that might be hiding just a room away!
Somasonic,Pro gamer logic more like üòÇ
Morthra,"Underrail teaches you not to do that. There's nothing for you off the beaten path, except death. The places you have to be and want to be are usually pretty easy to find."
smandroid,How do you turn on this overlay? I have to switch to maps to see where I'm going. I've only started chapter 2 though.
Ok-disaster2022,"I have a unique talent in games for going directly through the shortest route through a maze, all because I want to actually explore everything, so I following the correct route I still have to take twice as long. This works though as one time my friends and I were playing through an JRPG and one point of it there's this maze that my fiend said was really tedious. I took control and we were out in less than 20 minutes. It was hilarious to see the look on his face."
IntuneUser2204, The Calisto Protocol - take notes.
Nivius,i dont play games that tell me where to go like im some fucking braindead zombie
LoveThieves,"Me: would like to continue, nope. Sidequest."
Xim_X_anny,Yeah that's a rule
Magic-killer3317,To quote the legendary jacksepticeye ‚ÄúI want all the secrets‚Äù
Yukianevlum,Sound right lol
CantaloupeCool6256,Gotta get them secrets
ChaosMiles07,"""Good adventurers go left"""
greywarden133,"""Mmmm gonna look 'round some""

\- Geralt 2022-"
Silkies4life,This game has been fuckin me up and I love it
Woogz_,"Worst part is when I go and see what I think is the right path, so I explore but then see another path that might be right, I decide to go back to check out the first path and it plays a cutscene."
rossywill,yes.
AgentSiren,its not my fault that most game dev always put secret collectibles or skippable item in the game levelüò§
Zeno_Bueno,I wanna play this game so bad im too scared of the jumpscares
rLosto,"Not all gamers like to explore. 
But I do"
-Memnarch-,\*DING\*
HowVeryReddit,If I get where I'm supposed to go on time I missed a lot of good loot.
Rexon2250,This is the way
killbauer,"Hey, you might miss out some optional content if you don't do that!"
DenVosReinaert,"Progress.... does not always mean ""moving forward""."
acetrainer03,Exactly.
KekkuliciousOfficial,This is the way
Starflamer,"And that is exactly why I hate that first lvl in Read: Player One... So many years of trying to beat the level, and noone thought to go backwards? So many gamers and noone tried what would happen if u go backwards? BS!"
Queasy-Swimming4012,Lol I just got done playing dead space EXACTLY like the meme. NEVER FOLLOW DIRECTIONS
GaaraSama83,It's the LAW.
Gradedcaboose,"   It must be a weird time for glenn shofield, his first games remake is getting wayyy more praise than his most recent game that just release a few weeks ago. 

   I have barely seen any mention of Callisto protocol since release and imo dead space remake is miles better than Callisto in every way. 

   I gotta give credit to EA Motive, this game looks and runs so much better than I expected coming from an in-house EA studio."
Thymogpie,Side quests in a nutshell
LadyFerretQueen,Every time in every game. I think Mario trained me to do this.
KuttDesair,"But Dead Space gets ya, you need two things in two different directions, so even if it isn't your current objective, you still need to go that way."
superthrowguy,This is >!how to rescue takemura in cyberpunk!<
wellbornwinter6,So I have to explore in dead space remake? Or what?
Verothyn,"My problem in games is thinking I‚Äôm taking a secret route to a chest, and end up having to replay the level because it was the main route the whole time."
spyder616,Objectives cool but my god look at that loot.
Rreizero,"I'm just glad that there's a lot of us. Some of my normie companions does not get it and be like ""you're going the wrong way"".."
Gamersnews32,Gotta get those last few collectibles and last bit of sightseeing before a cutscene locks you out of that area.
BlitheringIdiot0529,"Well, the game has side missions."
Sirmac13,Don't give me a choice.
Hazee302,This is the way.
cataclysm49,This was one of my biggest frustrations with Callisto Protocol... I kept going the right way and needed to backtrack to find stuff that was hidden the wrong way.
Mr-McClean,This is one of my biggest issues with lets say Callisto protocol. I wanna know where i cant go first. Instead I‚Äôm just running around hoping i don‚Äôt trigger something progress to far and cant go back
VagrantChrisX,"and this is why Dead Space is superior to Calisto Protocol, you know exactly where not to go 1st"
WhitestMikeUKnow,Obviously
SAO_Fan17,Except for the games that don‚Äôt tell you which area progresses the story and which way has loot. *cough cough* Tales of Arise *cough cough*
dugthefreshest,"(dead space radar sound)

""Skoobaleeboobaleeboop"""
Rob27shred,"Can confirm, this is de wey!"
julbull73,"Side rant: This infuriates me just a LITTLE less than when someone wants to make a platformer and throws it into my FPS, RPG, etc. So you have to do something with controls and a design that doesn't work for it!!! Titanfall series...I miss you. 

BUT this also pisses me off. For different reasons, you lock shit off after certain points and in most games its just a ""fuck you, for doing what we asked so to force you to see this real cool room that I enjoyed making, I'm going to make you ""explore"""""
deathbunnyy,"You also used to be able to toggle it to show closest shop and workbench, seems they took that out though which is probably ok since they show on the map now."
HotQuietFart,Anyone hate the part where you have to turn off the lights?
undercon,I hate games that don't reward this
EternalNightmare7414,The Jacksepticeye way of gaming ü§£ü§£
monster_snowgoon,There might be stuff the other way. There's usually stuff the other way. Cool stuff.
xXShadowAndrewXx,"I do this soo much in minecraft dungeons that i got bored of the game, by doing a 5-10 minute adventure last 30 minutes"
PikabuBoy,Yes!!! That's why modern games show you the right way. That you would not be afraid to explore!
Beeslikesteve,"That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always done it. And I love it. Bioshock infinite. Anytime they show me where to go, I will go the opposite !"
Lazerhest,"Good memories from playing Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance with my friend. ""This is the correct way, turn around!"""
Sinaskafitch,"Funny they use Deadspace as an example, because this is exactly the last game you want to try this in. 

""The guide says to enter this room, but I'm gonna see what's in here first.""

*opens door to reveal room full of enraged necromorphs*

""You know what, guide? You're right. Why did I ever doubt you?..."""
sovereignsfall18,Every time.
Trantor_Dariel,"I did this in Metro Exodus and skipped some stuff and made my progression in one area a little weird. Props to the developer though,  it didn't make it impossible to progress and the characters even commented on the fact I'd explored and done a few things early."
nicolRB,I‚Äôm so glad for games that show me the way so i can go the other
DamienStark,"There's been a lot of ""open world fatigue"" lately, especially with the Ubisoft flavor of endlessly clearly icons off maps, but this is one of the reasons open world games became so popular.

Instead of having to do this awkward dance of constantly trying to guess what the ""wrong way"" to go is, so you can purposefully go there first before locking yourself out of missable loot, we just let you go wherever whenever, including back to areas where you may have fought a boss before."
EazyCheeze1978,"YES THIS IS THE WAY. If game developers take the time to make an expansive world, with lots of detail and multiple directions to go, and then they expect us to go in a certain direction to continue the main story and potentially railroad us away from these alternate paths, I'm going to take those alternate paths first, no matter what.

It would be a waste of my gaming dollar if all I ever did was the main story of these kinds of games. Robert Frost could not know that [one of his most popular poems](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken) could be applied to video games (but the difference is, we *can* actually travel both ways, just the other, ""main"" one will have to wait a while :) )"
PurpleBullets,"Well yeah, that‚Äôs where they put all the Stuff^^TM"
jas75249,They went through the trouble of putting that other way into the game so there has to be something there.
Raze0013,My greed is greater than my fear.
hot-juicy-pork-chops,"I shall be telling this with a moot breath
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I---
I took the loot path"
GreedyTank939,I remember when Bioshock came out everyone said turn off the marker so you find things for yourself. That's great and all but I want to keep the market so I know where not to go.
ChubbyMG,I wish more games showed you which way to go to progress so you can avoid accidentally progressing before you explore. Also I often run into terrible game design where the way forward isn‚Äôt obvious at all and I spend an hour running around aimlessly.
Rottenvenom23,"Yep, video games have taught me ""objective"" and ""counter-objective"" for the loot."
NotMyFuzzy,Its how you get the hidden loot!
siraph,"A long time ago, in Half Life 1, episode 1 (I think), they had a developer commentary. They explained that they had an open area for players to explore - had quite a few abandoned houses and shacks. One of them, from the outside was designed in such a way that you knew once you entered it, you'd not be able to leave. So they designed the area like that so that the last thing you do is the actual objective as players tend to want to explore areas they know they can get back from."
BronzeHeart92,Always check everywhere's a maxim for a reason!
greengo07,why would you go straight to the main quest end and ignore all that superb content waiting to be explored? MY goal is to make the experience LAST (assuming it is a fun experience)
IamAkevinJames,"Smt Nocturne. Og or remaster is you have the dlc that adds in the hard lesson.

At the beginning you just become  the demi fiend. You try to enter elevator to enter a trippy world. You are told to go left. If you don't you will most certainly be killed."
GenuineSmirk,They don't tell you all Isaac wanted to do was to find the coffee maker.
Mr_Blue_Jay,"Gamer Logic: *‚ÄùI hate it when video games put annoying markers to point where you need to go, it takes the fun out of exploring‚Äù*

*proceeds to ignore going to objective when it‚Äôs not being pointed at*"
WesMantooth-,Obviously üòÇ
TheHorribleBacon,That's what a normal gamer would do
theTallBoy,There is never a bonus feature to find going the way the game tells you....
Knighthawk235,"What if there are hidden items, weapons, or rare items the other way?

Sometimes it pays to take the scenic route to an objective."
HyperionPhalanx,Where the wrong way is the right way
IIImmmDavidPumpkins,"How else are you supposed to be properly stocked up for the tough fights? I like to see all the detail and effort put into the games, not just beat them as fast as possible"
Bobbicito,The last of us
SmallestFrogOnEarth,"I don't want the way forward, I want the way secrets!"
Slick_Deezy,This is why my play through of God of War: Ragnarok is taking so long. Luckily I‚Äôve been rewarded for this almost every time so I don‚Äôt mind.
19CrimsonKing19,"No doubt, especially a game like this where u can upgrade weapons, armor, etc and still progress with or without said upgrades... waypoint finder is just in case u get stuck in the dark lol"
Gillalmighty,"Every time. Go this way! Yea, in a minute..."
murfi,this is the way. don't you hate it when you go a certain path thinking you're exploring before progressing the correct path only to discover you just triggered a cutscene from where you can't go back?
dc_dobbz,"To be fair, I do a version of this in real life too. Once I know where it is I‚Äôm supposed to go, if I have the time, I‚Äôm going a‚Äôwanderin."
Xaleypoo,"Yes, because there's gonna be a fucking cutscene that sends me to a new area and I'm gonna be pissed that I missed out on getting Dark King Gr√ºtmor's Edge of Annihilation."
jhguitarfreak,"For open world games it's go everywhere except where the objective is.

Doing that with Horizon Forbidden West was super fun.  
After I got past the ""embassy"" I snuck around the map's edge looking for cool shit.

Finding all the locations I wasn't supposed to yet and only getting a clearer context when those parts of the story opened it up."
n33bsauce,The blue line is there to tell you where NOT to go
PistoleroGent,Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire? on the N64 really delivered this message home
zippy91,That's how you find the loot
TipTronique,This is all of us. I watched my wife play GoW and literally told her to loot no less than 124 times.
Wh3re_am_I,THE COLLECTIBLES!
dustofdeath,That's why I explore the entire open world + sidequests before I start the main quest at max level and legendary gear.
loborex99,This person games.
Green_man619,"I love it when a game tells me where to go, so I can just go the other way and explore. If I have to find out then it's almost always the right way which is in fact the wrong way."
Wallace_W_Whitfield,"When I was playing the original, I did this. Found out I ended up going that way later instead. Basically doing the thing out of order simply because of exploration curiosity."
Papa_Pred,"Nah see with Dead Space, do the objectives in the area that make your life easier, *THEN* go explore

Y‚Äôall got me fucked up if you think I‚Äôm gonna explore in pitch black darkness lol. Doesn‚Äôt help that whenever you aim, it gets darker around you"
phantonyte,"This was me in Dynasty Warriors 7, where I wanted to just go other places but so many objectives come up and you've gotta be there in time or the whole damn mission fails. It's like that game discourages exploring."
JoushMark,"""Okay, so if this is the critical path this optional area likely has stuff I can explore without triggering the next area and being unable to come back and check it out later.""  


I love it when a games like.. ""here's the end of the level. Go there when you are done playing around."""
MrWolf_9587,So true
ZakkTheInsomniac,classic
xoxREPOxox,"I am so glad that other people do this. 
ü§£"
this_barb,"Line leads you to the scary bits, though."
JuanaLaPutana,"This is why I have over 100 hours in elden ring, and haven't finish yet"
Native_Kurt-ifact,This is the way.
thequaintpundit354,"How else are you going to be adequately prepared for the difficult battles? Instead than merely beating the games as quickly as possible, I prefer to see how much thought and work went into them."
supremecolleague901,"Why would you skip all that fantastic stuff that is just waiting to be explored and head right to the main quest's conclusion? If the experience is enjoyable, MY aim is to make it last."
BreezyProrogation939,Each time.
imaginarydemeanor257,"THIS IS THE WAY, indeed. I'm going to pursue the other roads first, regardless of the circumstances, if game designers spend the effort to create a vast environment with lots of detail and several directions to travel, and then they want us to go in that direction to continue the main plot and maybe railroad us away from these different paths."
HolisticRegulator132,"Okay, so if this is the critical path, this optional region probably includes things I can examine without activating the following area and making it impossible for me to return and look it over later."
DarkMatterBurrito,The 2008 Dead Space did this also. Are you stupid?
BlueHarlequin7,Except the only paths you can take in Deadspace progress you unless you backtrack.
xXArctracerXx,I for one want a game to break this logic and have it point you in the wrong direction so when you go to explore you end up continuing the story instead
UrsusRex01,"Yup. That's badly designed exploration.

I love Dead Space but that part isn't its forte. 
Good exploration is when you have to figure the way to go yourself."
ninetaquil,NOPE not on this game. I'd noclip straight to the objective if I could
