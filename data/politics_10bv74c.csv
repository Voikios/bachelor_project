elguiridelocho,"The clip: https://twitter.com/patriottakes/status/1613938363060424718

>  ... his full legal name cannot be confirmed as his birth certificate has not been made public, and it is not clear why he has gone by multiple variations of that name.

> Other resurfaced clips and social media posts reveal that Santos had gone by the names Anthony Devolder and George Devolder until as recently as 2020.

>George Anthony Devolder Santos announced his candidacy for Congressional District 3 in Northeast Queens and Long Island, the seat currently occupied by Rep. Tom Suozzi (D).

So it seems like it's part of his name. The fact is though that he's going by various combinations. And that, among other things about him, puts him amongst some of the shadiest characters in congress right now.  


>Name: George Anthony Devolder-Santos  
Status: Congressional Candidate  
State/District: NY03

you would be fired from any job in existence for this guy’s fuckery *except* being a politician. you know, the folks who are entrusted and empowered to *run the country*.

Santos committed voter fraud on a massive scale. It’s that simple. what? the wording of the various statutes governing voter fraud don’t really cover intentionally lying to hundreds of thousands of people for the purpose of securing their votes to get elected? Votes he wouldn’t have gotten if his resume was even half accurate? 

“hmm. that doesn’t seem right. we should change those statutes. someone go grab George for lunch.”

It’s shameful that Santos is still in the job, and only a handful of current Republican congressman have called for his resignation (all but 1 from NY last count, and only following the Nassau County Republican leadership’s call for him to step down). House Speaker McCarthy said Wednesday that “Mr. Santos will continue to serve.” Apparently the Party’s requirements for a qualifying congressman have been pared down to “human form with ability to cast vote.”

We all expect these politicians to play teams, right? that’s a given, and fair enough. But egregiously unethical (and continuous) behavior should be a hard stop in any context. Lying, cheating, shamelessness and refusal to admit serious wrongs - these are *universally* condemned characteristics and behaviors deserving of harsh and meaningful punishment. At least that’s what they start teaching us at 3 years old. Is no transgression too egregious for this party? Unfortunately, we’ll have to wait and see - at our collective expense. 

I’ll end with this reminder: Al Franken, a respected senator, was gone in less than 3 weeks for an unwanted kiss. At his own party’s insistence."

h3wlett,"He's Brazilian and a lot of Brazilians have multiple names.

According to his resume which was posted by the New York Times, his name is George Anthony Devolder Santos.

Like a lot of Brazilians, and I mean alot, they live lives defrauding others. I live in South Florida where this is common place.

I think it's amazing how he fabricated a career of success in high finance, and no one checked him on any of his credentials. 

His resume also reads as though he just googled stock examples of things that sound good as work achievements but make very little sense, especially in his made up roles at Citibank and Goldman Sachs.

I still can't believe that someone like him lies about every aspect of his life, got elected based on those lies, and there's no recourse to hold him accountable and kick him out.

What's even worse is that Kevin McCarthy in all his spineless wisdom is apologizing on his behalf in hopes to sweep his misdeeds under the rug and maintain his razor thing majority.

That means that Santos' corruption is now McCarthy's corruption. And both are okay with it.

I hope criminal charges are brought against Santos for outright fraud.

I believe there is a Russian backing to Santos.

In one interview he stated that he'd been to Moscow many times. No reason a 34 year old with no other business or family ties to Russia would have to visit that place ""many times.""

He's very clearly a patsy that was identified by outside agents as an ideal candidate to groom into someone that they can insert into the highest halls of our government and control.

Again, I believe it's Russia that has been behind Santos.
