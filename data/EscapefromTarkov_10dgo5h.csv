BUNDLEOFSTLCKS,"No cheater. Just been ""tarkoved"" (obvious joke)"
LanikM,Did you look up their name? I'm curious how high this guy is getting with cheats like these without being banned.
Chaos323,Labs is a cheating mess right now from what I've seen my friends have experienced. Personally won't run labs just cause I'm not a fan.
Mesromith,Nothing to do with the cheater situation but i‚Äôd love see more gameplay clips showing the full squads pov at the same time for the raid and seeing what everyone sees during fights etc.

The_Superfist,"This happened on shoreline to myself and two friends.  We all said at the same time ""I'm dead."".  All head-eyes.


Our fourth friend won't play anymore because this happens a few times per night.  I think one from this incident the other night won't play anymore either.  My two friends were both level 2, first wipe.  I'm lvl 14 first wipe, and I love the game, but won't put up with this shit much more.


It won't be long before my friends pick another game and I go play with them.  The raids without cheaters, even the ones we get wrecked and wiped in a fight, are fun.  But getting wrecked by damage-immune flying fuckers and aim-bots that wipe a whole group in a half second?  No thanks."
Cosmandoo,"What, you're telling me you've never gotten 3 headshots thru ulachs when peaking a doorway in one go? Filthy casual. 


/S 


Depending on if this was edited to sync the deaths, or if these deaths actually happened this quickly in succession - if the latter, Def a hacker. Hope you reported the name :)"
HappyMetalViking,"Seems suspicious. Hope you all Hit the Report Button.
I think there will be a ban Wave, BSG does that from time to time."
ReformedLifter,get rengawr in a room with that guy for 10 mins and he will be gone
DoBiits,Are you seriously asking if this is sus? all of you dead within what? .2 of  second? obviously thats sus af
NicePumasKid,These were always the deaths that tilted me the most.  You have a 3/4 man party and everyone says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dead‚Äù at the same time and then everyone realizes it was one person lmao.
CoatAlternative1771,"I immediately sell my labs keycards.  

Would I love to play it? Yes. But why risk it? Why risk 300k roubles just to watch you get killed by a cheater within 4 seconds of spawning?"
zZDKVZz,Bro has the whole squad recording set up
Yukisuna,"100% aimbot, not even a question if.

Side note, its really cool to see the squad perspective like this."
AlphaNumericApostle,"My man, you‚Äôre on labs. You were the only 3 in that lobby NOT cheating."
Relative-Serve-5588,"Don't worry, Rengawr is on it."
SwiftBetrayal,Bsg makes game Grindy > makes people wanna buy gear or hardcore no life > cheaters sell gear for RMT  > Cheaters Ban > buy new accounts > Bsg makes money
Bnasty909,BSG could just sit and watch labs all day and ban most of their cheaters. But they won't they actually like having cheaters cause Nakita hates the player base and any misery we have he enjoys.
pancakeface101,Tarkov is the biggest cheating game. 0 defense against cheaters. Awesome game that‚Äôs been failed by cheaters. Such a shame.
Levi31k,"Nah its normal, every tarkov player is able to insta one-tap head eyes /s"
JustSeraph,Sus af
TheSto1989,At this point cheaters are actually a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù to increase difficulty and make the game more hardcore.
shady531,It shouldn't be against this subreddits policy to share usernames when it's a blatant as this
shady531,"I can't tell if you're being serious by asking the question. Of course this is sus. It's more than sus, it's blatant cheats"
StealthCatUK,You are on labs and crying about cheaters? That's like putting a paedophile in a school and being surprised to find him touching the kids.
TurdSpliter,"Shots 1-5 clearly hit 

Shots 6-9 hit due to great accuracy control 

Shots 10-11 Incredible shots

Shot 12 like I said, clearly hit."
TheRealHaurel,"I saw something like this in that movie ""Wanted"" (2008)."
DomiCrash,"if you 3 would have laid right next to each other, faces glued together and holding hands than yes, nothing sus about it.. but since youve probably not, sus af, dude"
MemeOps,"My boy do be cheetin.

I dont even bother going geared into labs or shoreline atm, just pissing gear away."
sorvis,"This is why I stopped, hardcore tactical shooter means I care and try, so what's the point with this much cheating.

Fun concept, love being immersed but the cheating just kills this game for me."
Chindisery,"There is no cheating in tarkov it simply is not possible.

This comment was provided to you by the Escape from Tarkov subreddit mod team."
Wekted,That's just every labs raid my guy.
Oniondice342,This game really is going down the shitter fast. And BSG is very clearly choosing profits over game integrity. Otherwise the cheating problem would be destroyed.
CaptainTortillas_,"Bro with spacing like that he didn‚Äôt even need to cheat, one grenade would have killed all three of you"
Ranger1803,Labs is unplayable. Ive only seen 1 cheater outside of labs in my 200 raids but out of around 20 raids on labs 15 have ended with full auto m855 into my head.
MoonBoy2DaMoon,‚ÄúHow can you be so sure he‚Äôs cheating? Could be desync‚Äù - ü§ì
Its__Faithful,Def just a skill issue. /s
KasiimirBF,He was just clearing out the rat infestation in server office on labs
Key-Pomegranate159,i bin tot
vDub1T,"I could MAYBE see it if this guy is cracked out of his mind, like shroud level lol. Everyone seemed pretty close together. I also wanna know what he shot you with. But it's so fast I'd have definitely reported cheats just in case."
0x766f6c74,"Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.  
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).  
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.  
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead."
Superdega,It looks legit. It happens a lot to me and my team. I have concluded this is the tarkov experience. Thats why I want to ask for a refund.
CoatAlternative1771,"Could be hacker.  Could be desync.

I got killed yesterday a full 10 seconds before my friend saw it happen while I was watching his stream."
Plank_Pusher,Just a good gaming chair
CerberusB,He must have really nice RGB Socks
_MegaLego_,better chair tbh
kryptek_86,"Man... I want to love this game but the one time I ever played labs, my friend and I were killed by a cheater."
Lolski13,"Please sent the vids sharing irl time line.
Is this is not an eddited time line, then its cheating."
Poonamoon,"I‚Äôve had a very similar experience the only two times I‚Äôve played Labs this wipe

It‚Äôs a shame, really"
TheLittleChosenOne,Yes its a cheater. What BSG should do is make private servers or some anti cheat servers where a person from the community will spectate the game and tell if someone cheating and ban them from that server. Then legit player will go there and non legit players will stay out. The community would have to do a lot of work tho.
Justiceits3lf,"Sir, you don't have 50,000 followers so this is clearly not a hacker. This is merely net code issues."
Collguydev,not sus at all (joke)
SlipperyMangoTurtle,I had the exact same thing happen on customs. Same guy head eyes the 4 man almost at the exact same time. It was awesome
arct1ccz,"Many on this reddit: ""SkiLL iSsUe""

Legit casual: ""What the fuck just happened?!""

The cheater: ""DING! DING! DING! .... IiiiiiiZi!!!!"""
Solid_Adhesiveness23,You guys obviously just have to get good! Or maybe try a different gaming chair...
sweetwawe,I love labs ether its an empty lobby or a lobby with cheaters
MrLuchador,Mastered the art of the deadly bullet. You had no chance.
Tap1oka,looks clean to me. guy was just taking a gathering step.
tryin_to_make_u_mad,Without fail everytime my duo has ran a tier 6 to literally fucking anywhere were dead within 5min and a couple seconds of each other. Wear tier 4 with 100k gun and you'll never see one
SafeViolinist691,u/savevideobot
AmicusBestia,"Dont be shy, show their name"
pizzaslut4pizzahut,This video is the reason I haven't played this map since 2019
AverageMetalConsumer,"BSG be like "" it's a mystery"""
Crown4QH,Watch out for the RealIronMike. Confirmed 202 accounts all named 001-202. Clapped my entire team with 1 burst.
SuperRektT,"Is a real question? Now i understand those ""2000000 raids this wipe, 0 cheaters found"""
LordJaeger88,Did not even see the enemy..
JiffTheJester,"Labs is a cheater shit hole fuck that map. Unfortunate too, the PvP used to be so good there. Too bad Bsg can‚Äôt figure out the cheating."
francoispaquettetrem,"whenever I spawn as a scav with a labs keycard, I just drop it. So far cheaters leave me be"
AdvancedEar2375,"Died to a cheater at that exact spot last wipe, he flew out that door the same millisecond he put 20 head eyes through my faceshield with M61 ü§£ Crazy with the tripple instakill here... There just has to be ways to detect this type of hacked movements and shooting... It's not like this was the first time either."
SlaveDeMorto,But where is the rest of the video? For all we know you sent him your geolocation so he knew where to shoot.
Unable_Physics7683,"Do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt play Labs. Every time I‚Äôve gone there I‚Äôve had a blatant cheater kill me. Two floaty boys then one guy following me a floor above me, shooting at the ground, and telling me (my username) to drop my gear lol I pretty much only scav at this point, the hacking this wipe is awful"
bookcoda,Nah man it was desync everyone knows there no cheaters in tarkov I have never run into any in over 2000 hours.
-Shibdib-,"Obviously had a better gamer chair.

But why is your buddy just laying prone in the open? Presents only his face as a target."
mYTHEstar,"200% cheater, report...move on, repeat and uninstal at the end...  


And to the people talking like ""I dont go to labs, its full of cheaters all the time, i dont go shoreline its cheatfest..."" etc.  


You cant actually play the game you paid for...and argument thats still in development, wake up and stop being delusional. They dont care at all. playing the game in its state right now is masochism"
ZMAC698,Obviously lol. Why even ask?
sulowitch,"Still waiting for ""hmm.. might be desync, servers are on fire right now"" comment..."
Deblob2009,Was in labs today. Guy was floating around and kept putting the odd bullet in my legs to cripple me. Flying from pillar to pillar. Shouted his boys to kill me so I couldn't report him. Shady dude
FireRocs,I think its foolish when people show blatant clips of cheating and say ‚Äúis he sus or not?‚Äù Like no shit. Its cheats and its obvious. Drop the name and lets get to work to getting that account banned
Enchantedmango1993,How do hackers get access to labs cards tho? Since they made them hard to get
Reggie2b2t,"rengawr joke, give me upvotes."
BitterQuitter11,"You said labs, 100% non sus off rip /s."
spamdatm4,"i stopped playing labs once it stopped being free. Sure there was hackers when it was free, But now. LOL dumb nikitia thinks adding in a pay card wont somehow attract cheaters, soon as they made keycard required EVERY cheater said, this is our map and to ensure we get money we cheat on it. anyone that plays that map now lol go toss your gear in the random spot of a map its the same thing."
benji_jones1999,Not a cheater just using jfk's magic bullet
Papa_Groot,Just desync man
Ok_Faithlessness9724,Like completely legit to me
EvanMiata,Nah he just had good aim and a 700$ gaming chair
ATacticalBagel,"If you died on Labs, it's sus /s"
RichCaTs,this happened like 5 times 2 wipes ago
Backdoor_Delivery,I wanna see his chair and where he got it!
CarbineJack,Cheaters are even using eod accounts cause they can pick them up for $80. Cheating will always be a problem and BSG won't do anything about it. Best thing we can do is just stop playing and let the game die at this point.
Chunckeychickeno,Probably same guy that killed rengawr
noahsark02,Get gud scrub üëÄ.
eddy_brooks,"Definitely sus. Happened to me and a buddy on interchange, exact same situation. 

I died immediately in the middle of a hallway with nobody around, figured somebody hiding got a lucky headshot. Then my buddy ran around the corner, and jumped down the escalators into car garage, where nobody should have line of sight on him, and same thing. He dropped dead while midair falling between the floors."
PckMan,Even in the off chance that someone does headshot a squad it's practically impossible to do with zero shots missed. Hacks.
Argonile,If you look super closely you can see the single bullet travelling through one head into the other with pinpoint accuracy. Outstanding move!
hazard5114,Either a cheater or John Wick
RousseSvelte,Dsync ofc
russianfist,Gotta invest in a new gaming chair
flearoy77,Better gaming chair
igg73,How am i supposed to get into the wipe with shit like this?
niceBobJobShowVagene,'casual' and 'labs' together in a sentence lmfao
NabuBot,Lmao well he's defo cheating but why tf yall lined up in there like Ed Edd n Eddy.
Seabird32,"My friend and I were playing Woods yesterday trying to do some little tasks and he got picked off immediately so I laid down as a quick reaction. The guy that killed him said ""I want to hear you run"" so naturally I turned around and ran up the hill like a little bitch onto an overlooking rock considering peaking and killing him. He proceeded to call me BY NAME ""Seabird"", he yelled from across the road. ""I was sent here to kill you and your friend."" He  crossed the road, ran up the hill, and while taking all kinds of shots and absolutely shit on me. I reported him for cheating because how did he know my in-game name? but I just know this supervillain is still out there. Keep your eyes peeled."
Event82Horizon,"Congratz, you got killed by John Wick. /s"
fifthg3n,I hope the sus or not is satire
buckem420,"With how close you guys were, it could have been completely legit."
sunofspeed,He must have a top of the line gamer chair
No_Industry6924,"Were working on it kinda sort of, maybe?
- nikita blyat"
Andyk688,"Yeah man. It‚Äôs hacking. You‚Äôre all dead instantly lol, like instantly. Assuming tier 5 armor as well? He would have to land every bullet perfectly within one tenth of a second. It‚Äôs funny how obvious this"
im_rank1,Skill issue
Federal-Gur5505,Deff sus but yanno that‚Äôs tarky gotta love it
MinoMonstaur,Not sus seems legit
Lazypole,"Had this yesterday on Lighthouse, both killed head eyes (interestingly we were 30 feet apart, facing opposite directions) at full sprint, in the exact same second. Weirdly our third was spared, guess he thought he was being a bit too obvious."
gen_adams,came to see ppl defend this
Piwinom,Killer: Arthur Morgan with DeadEye
litaoyuan,good gaming chair
Holiday-Chef-6838,Skill dif
lonigus,"Rule number 1. going into labs: Dont have a chinese name (you will get killed by other chinese cheaters 100%)

Rule number 2. ~~select only one server~~  (no longer possible)

Rule number 3. dont go in with meta gear armor (slick/hex/altyn)

Rule number 4. if you hear quick burts of gunshots go call the elevator and leave."
frank0420cs,sus?? No no no just guy with better rgb keyboard
BLSmith2112,The Rengawr jokes are now annoying.
WhereAmIAtThough,Since BSG does hardware bans I don‚Äôt understand how cheaters are still so prevalent (if battleeye worked correctly. Is there a way to circumvent hardware bans? Havnt played in a couple wipes and was thinking of getting a new PC to start again but with prevalence of cheaters like there is idk if I wanna drop that kinda money on it
prive666,"I notice the cheating problem on customs as well... Every time I Scav-raid and have an expensive and full backpack or a stim needed for ""Samples"", I get killed by another Scav player... sus"
SteadyDJ516,See he's obviously just better and it's simply a skill issue
AdBitter2197,All Skill
Commercial_Prune5082,"def not a hacker; its just a good m67 grenade throw you all died to.. grenades always headshot
100% legit plays here!"
PlayerKnotFound,Unless your life is quantum entangled with your teammates then yeah cheater
DoomSlayer6,Unnstalled the game years ago. I refuse to pay $200 a month for cheats just to survive
i_luv_u_Jennae,"""It's HIGH NOON"""
AspireVenom,"Labs right now is unplayable, flyhackers everywhere sadly."
Kaieron,something has changed now that you cried a little?
skalapunk,Skill issue /s
Callofthevoid1985,That's more sus than witnessing the imp kill someone in Among Us.
AKoper8tor,"Summary:  
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.  
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).  
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.  
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because you were already dead."
whiteboykos,That a cheater but in the same time you are 3 trash player holding the same door
Bladabistok,do you know how to use punctuation maybe it just really hurts your brain to remember using those little dots I can understand
THENATHE,"I have straight up gotten a 3 person kill with one shot from an absolutely crazy lucky ricochet. Not saying that is what happened here, but I‚Äôve seen crazier shit"
ShogunBushido,"The game fucking sucks, BSG doesn‚Äôt care nor will they ever. If what you‚Äôre saying is true, which I‚Äôm taking with a grain of salt just because you didn‚Äôt show the players name appearing if all your post raid screens, it wouldn‚Äôt be sus it would be obvious. Find it funny how after almost 4 years of owning this trash game the community is barely opening their eyes and acknowledging the cheater problem AFTER streamers started saying the issue was present. I haven‚Äôt played Tarkov in almost a year and I have no plans on playing until it‚Äôs completely fixed. If that never happens then I‚Äôll take the L. Godspeed to all of you that are putting up with it though."
