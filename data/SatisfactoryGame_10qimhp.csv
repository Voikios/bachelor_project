Unskrood,"So, so many times I'll be building in the desert, waiting to make sure everything is balanced right, and look up at the stars and just... appreciate the devs so much."
nikrodaz,“It’s just a factory building game”
sselesUssecnirP,"""Hey look, Mustafar is in the sky."""
CautiousFreedom6889,And immediately start thinking of ways you could build a factory there.
Collistoralo,There’s a reason it’s called Satisfactory
Newmach,I hate realizing how much unexploited nature is left every time I look up. What a waste of good factory space.
Alfadorfox,"This is why I try to leave the vegetation intact wherever I don't \*have\* to clear it for building. It's a beautiful world, and even if I am exploiting its resources, one of those resources is natural beauty, best exploited by preserving it for future viewing."
AIVandal,"Well that's it for your 'looking up' break, back to work pioneer"
Lithominium,This shit look like rwby volume 9 i love it
Background-Fox-8742,Burn it. burn it all. The factory must grow.
Job-Mundane,I didn’t know they added Cordium to Satisfactory.
Saaihead,"This is one of the moments where I fell in love with this game. I was building my first advanced steel factory, it was late at night, and after putting in the last conveyor belt I looked up and saw this red glow outside while the sun was rising. Goosebumps! Now, more than 3000 hours of gametime later, I still love the atmospheric lighting in the different biomes and sometimes halt just to look at the sun set of rise. <3"
PoiseEn,I really want to frame a screenshot from this game. It would look so beautiful on my wall
botti_,"Well, time to destroy the ecosystem"
