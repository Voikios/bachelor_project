Not2goblinsinacoat,"I agree for different reasons as a newer player lol. I use scav runs as a wind down from stressful pmc raids. Usually ill just do customs pop in with 15-18 min left and pick some missed stashes and scraps from bodies while i watch a youtube video pretty much unmolested

When i spawn in and the raid has barely started it kinda ruins my whole vibe"
xxTERMINATOR0xx,*cough* streets *cough*
This_Dingo7979,What is this map?
squidshark,"It’s like this at the beginning of every wipe, it will happen less soon"
juicebox_tgs,"Agreed. As you play a map you learn the spawns and you learn where you are 'safe' or not. Having some guy spawn right behind you when you just cleared an area isn't fun or clever. Its irritating.

This is me saying this after I spawned right behind a pmc on factory and got a free kill. Completely unfair and not good gameplay imo"
kentrak,"You're mistaking a mechanic to combat a problem with the problem itself.  Scavs don't usually spawn too early because they'd vacuum up all the good stuff and bail.  If the good stuff is spread all around and it takes a lot of exploration and searching, then having player scavs early isn't really a problem.  They risk less, but are vastly outclassed compared to most PMCs.

Players scavs early without a major loss in looting ability leads to better and more dynamic raids, as instead of dumb AI you're dealing with actual other people.  If you're mad because player scavs are actually killing you, then you should maybe not assume they're all dumb AI or aimbots and treat them like real threats."
BigLoad96,Good luck with that. Would mean scav mains have to wait even longer for games. This sub = scav main central considering how much traction the posts get complaining about 10+ minute queue times. I haven't waited more then 5 minutes to get into a game on my PMC.
cjhoser,Ironically you went in basic a scav gettup lol
turtlejizziz,"It's actually a very convenient thing. Spawn as a PMC and run straight to a popular scav extract and camp it.  Then just phone up uber scavs and they just keep appearing, bringing all the maps tasty loot. 

The best thing is, once you kill your first scav, the next one can't resist looting the dead scav so they stand still for you to!"
Maxos43,# Don't bring blue helmet to a survival game :D
M1DZ_ON1Y,"I have the same complaint as a scav honestly. I don’t want to load into reserve with 25 minutes left. 

Scav runs are really aggravating right now. 15 minute queue time and I load into he beginning of a raid and die to a PMC within 2-3 minutes."
ConsumeFudge,"There's too many scav mains on this sub so be prepared to be down voted to shit and told how it's healthy for the game to have players on the free loot run have better spawns than PMCs for some of the loot on lighthouse, interchange, etc"
waFFLEz_,"I know I'm in the minority, but I honestly like it. 

Player scavs are great loot pinatas and it's a lot more fun fighting them than looting shelves 

It will die down later in the wipe though like it usually does, when the player numbers go down"
lonigus,Iam a scav enjoyer (more then i should tbh with easy over 2000 scav raids each wipe) and i fully agree. Scavs should never spawn sooner then 10 mins after the PMC spawns. On streets the first scavs should spawn not sooner then at minute 35 mark as that map has enough loot.
Shoogan26,Guess thats why my pmc gets into raids before the 2 min mark
tacobellisdank,Like every wipe?
BooBs_In_My_Inbox,I just wanna stop hearing every scav's chatter across the entire map as a low background mumble.
FuriousBadgers,"Lighthouse, try sniping rogues in the first 5 minutes and having 5 parasite scav players running and proning on roofs taking all your shit."
DuckInCup,"I mean, why not? It would make sense for the scavs to already be there when you get there tbh."
Sensitive_Regular388,Most important mechanic in this game is risk vs reward. Being able to risk nothing with just as much reward as any pmc is a huge balance issue. Timmys can't stand the fact they might have to bring in their sks and paca instead of scavving.
AquaPSN-XBOX,Too many awful players who never use real gear and just scav because they suck in this sub to realize the problem. You’re just gonna get downvoted while JimmyJohn1230 says “skill issue” despite having more deaths than PMC kills
Scavwithaslick,"Well they’re scavengers in the sense that they’re Russian locals. It makes sense that if there are regular scavs in your area, player scavs can be there too. It’s annoying that they’re there, but then again, they’re scavengers, why would they wait for you to leave"
KeyetsoYT,"I’m not a scav main, nor do I play scav a whole lot (ten times on average per wipe) but I think they should spawn in before us or at the same time. I mean, it’s Tarkov. Pretty sure lore wise “scavs” are just the locals."
tommytizzel,"The entitlement here is astounding 

News flash.... Once you infil you aren't safe until the extraction time hits zero."
SpaceCuhdet,So you can’t kill scavs is what I’m hearing eh?
darkberry91,I died to a pmc camping a scav extract with 2 other players but im not gonna make a post about it complaining it's just tarkov you live or you die but both are going to happen.
mr_snuggels,"\> There's nothing to scavenge if the pmcs haven't even had time to get anywhere yet.

You could kill player scavs and take the loot that they supposedly arrived at before you. 

I don't know where this idea of if ""I'm loading in with my PMC I should have the lobby to my self for a set amount of minutes"" came from."
lolpert1,"I've been saying this and there are so many people who defend it, its crazy. You shouldn't be able to scav in on lighthouse and get to the good loot and extract before I've even had a chance to get to it on my pc. The whole point of a scav is to ""scavenge"" for loot. The leftovers."
OscarPapa1,"IMO, this is such a bullshit, rage related take"
ManKilledToDeath,The fact this is still an issue is why I'll just skip this wipe. I got domed by a player scav 52 seconds into a Customs raid last wipe. Could've been a cheater. It's an issue either way.
HellsFrogs,Cope nope
marniconuke,Don't cry
egiantmirror_skilled,Bros mad he couldn’t kill a pscav 💀
Medical-Vegetable522,Sounds like a skill issue
operation_hamster,Stop whining.
SamTheWise1,Don’t die. You’re bad!
g3org3_all3n,Skill issue
theirongiant74,"I died, this is clearly bullshit. BSG need to change it so I don't die."
Dizsmo,"I couldn't disagree more,it's actually fun I hate the stupid matches where you don't see anybody the entire time lol you guys need to start pushing fights if you're scared of scavs ffs"
FGLabs,"Scav main 4 lyfe!
Resistance is futile."
MyRightFootSmellsBad,Off topic but great name
No-Manufacturer-5310,Anything you Reddit efters don’t complain about lol
pbtechie,Make your own game then.
Cookie-Jedi,"OP: Backpack only runs to get loot and get out with profit are OK  
Also OP: PLAYER SCAVS TOO STRONK WAAAAA"
iDr0ski,Imagine being mad about a pvp game that made u pvp too early *chuckles*
firebolt_wt,"Get good.

If you lose to a player with halved weapons,bad optics, and no armor, that's on you."
P0werEdge,i did test myself on streets the scav as i don't play scav at all and the earliest i could go in was 2:30-3 min after the raid started which is pure bullshit
isdede,"If a fight with another pmc laste longer than 30sec, u get the kill. Its now horde mode vs player scavs to loot ur kill, hope ur brought enough meds, food and drink xd"
pu55ym0n3yw33d,"I agree, yesterday I played streets, spawned next to quest item, took it and started walking towards extract, about 3-4 minutes into the raid i got killed by a player scav..."
Lazy-Wish-7177,This wipe.. is... somthing different .
AviDski,I've died so much to scavs this wipe already that I take them way more seriously from the get go now.  Makes it harder but at least I'm mentally prepared for stuff like this 😅
bobby1kenobi,I like the idea on streets because the maps going to be so large and it makes sense that scavs would always be knocking around there.
shadowdoggie,same in interchange
No-Carry-7886,"I completely agree, player scavs should spawn at the absolute earliest 50% through the raid timer. This wipe as severely fucked with common sense I fee like. I still play and have fun but damn the level of bullshit keeps increasing.

Also bring back the fucking lighthouse on lighthouse. Fucking representing out here."
Czelious,"Agree I usually scav nighttime because you most of the time get in later in raids, i want to just chill and loot some leftovers on my scav, not do a PMC run with less gear.

Imo, as someone who even play every other raid as scav early wipe, scavs should not get into a raid earlier than at least 50% of the time."
chrisashley91,It’s an absolute joke. Within 10 minutes of a streets yesterday I killed 1 pmc and 7 player scavs. They should be scaving the final 25% of the match.. not in the first 10%.
JiffTheJester,For some reason this is only streets and lighthouse. Interchange scavs are always late
dendofyy,Yet I spawn into maps with 12-15 minutes remaining…
SiggyCertified,You’re absolutely right dude they had NO business being there. What an absolute outrage. How rude
Muffin__Stuffer,This has been like this last 2 wipes at the start.
Whatssun65,Can’t understand for a second why it’s not locked to half the raid time or less before it’s aloud. It seems like such an easy thing to fix. PMC’s should easily have plenty of time to go into raid and grab/loot and leave. Should never have a chance to see scavs if you move quick enough. Just one more easy fix that the majority of the players would agree would be a very good thing.
espkv,"the thing is nobody wants this, pmcs dont want scavs that early, but for me atleast i dont want to get a scav that early too, i'm supposed to take the scraps and maybe fight and kill pmcs that have overstayed their welcome :p"
morklonn,It’s crazy to see the same issues popping up every few months for the last 5 years. CANT WE JUST HAVE A FUN GAME TO PLAY?!
Wolf10k,"No shitting I was in queue for lighthouse and just when my back button disappeared my friend got on and queued a scav. 

He queued about 30 seconds after I entered raid, he was in at like a minute 40 of the raid.  Player scavs should only spawn during the last 40% of the raid time."
xEtrac,"I scav interchange and about 40-50% of the time I spawn in the first 2-4 minutes of a raid inside the mall. I’m able to hit all 3 tech stores, generic, and mantis before most players can even get to the mall and by that time I’m already headed out the back to extract. It’s bonkers."
Znafuu,Reserve pre-underground bunker use to be like this. I love it. Give me all the pvp.
Minute_Ad_4308,"Yep, especially it feels in Lighthouse or Streets. You just figured out your raid plan and there you see them running straight onto your whereabouts"
mmpa78,That looks like more than 4 minutes to me
gladbmo,The first P Scav spawns in as soon as the first PMC dies. That's how it has always worked.
powndz,"I don't get rich by running to high value spots and stuffing gpus and bitcoins up my butt, I do it by surviving. 

I have no issue with pscavs spawning at the same time as my pmc, they're basically moving loot piñatas."
Flimsy_Sheepherder_3,With spawns being based off the raid length. Most of the time I spawn in middle to end around the time most of the PCs have left. Erlyest iv gotten into a raid was on customs 40 mins raid nd I showed up at 36 mins ish left. Needless to say pmcs are far better geard and got me as soon as i poped my head out.
OhhhYaaa,"This is a funny problem which doesn't really have a good solution. The scav slots are limited by the amount of raids there is on the server. When there is a lot of demand, you either get a lot of complaints about 15 minutes searches as a scav, or you get complaints about scavs spawning too early. You kinda get fucked as a developer either way. 

My guess is increasing scav timers last wipe was one of their attempts to fix that, but obviously it didn't eliminate the issue. Random map for scav might make the problem smaller, but they might not want to do that for one reason or another."
the_debacle,"Interchange has been absurd with player scavs spawn time. I've spawned in as a scav multiple times only 3 minutes into a raid. Sometimes inside before the PMCs even get there. I wish I had a recording of when I spawned in Oli's by front office and immediately aimed down sights on a pmc that just came up escalator. I didn't even have to move, literally spawned in pointing a m700 at him."
Schxdxnfrxxdx,Just spawn player scavs along with PMCs and be done with it. At least player scavs can't 1-shot you across the map through obscurity like AI scavs have been.
QkaMan,I recently had scav raid on factory when I spawned at the exact same time as PMCs. I was immediately wiped out by team of four giga chads. Have no idea how that happened.
Electrician_Magician,Bummer
the_wenoodle,On all maps should be around 30 minutes depending on raid time. Just cut times in half for when player scabs are allowed in this way here its not just a race to the extract & a small chance to get some pmc kills.
ledouxx,"Yes there is a reason player scavs spawns so early on streets and lighthouse because that's all people wanna scav on. So what happens is all available player scav slots gets filled instantly so the starting time basically creeps up to the time the first pmc gets killed which easily could be 4min.

The only two options are then:

1. Set max time that has to have gone by before player scavs can spawn. Which would increase the matching time by that amount basically on streets at least.

2. Remove map selection for scavs"
bedriddendeer,Yeah on streets I’m running into 4 man scav hit squads at like 40 minutes still left in raid 💀
Sunkysanic,Idk OP kinda sounds to me like you might wanna git gud instead of asking bsg to fix it
Arzzet,"Yeah, tarkov population should magically appear to our convenience, maybe at midnight"
Zavodskoy,I haven't spawned into a single scav run with more than 15 minutes left this entire wipe
Interesting-Bee-124,I feel like that’s respectable … your complaint I mean … I do not mind fast regular scavs tho
xtoxicwizzy,Yeah i usually spawn as a scav 5-10 minutes in on a map thats time is 45+
whiteteepoison2,"I remember last wipe me and my buddy would spam scav on lighthouse because you could spawn at train and get first dibs on water treatment before any pmcs got there. Totally agree player scavs shouldn’t spawn until after 10 or so minutes after raid start. 

This wipe they changed it to streets because I’ve been spawning in around 46 minutes which is ridiculous"
zapdos47,"It is completely busted at the moment for streets , I’ve actually been doing exclusively streets scav so I can go find an impact nade in the dozen grenade boxes around the map and kill a pmc before the raid is even 10 minutes in. Good farm for scav karma"
toa57,Maybe you should just run scavs if you don’t like the pmc experience.
Unable_Physics7683,"Lol I spawned in the parking garage on Streets as a player scav, went up the first flight of stairs and got domed by a PMC. Literally lasted 1 minute and some change."
OKAPI-OKAPI619,"This is true, but it looks like you were on factory judging by the double barrel? In which case 4 minutes in makes lots of sense. But idk what map you were on"
hansnicolaim,Only happens on Streets and Lighthouse in my experience. I nearly only go Reserve and max is like 20 minutes. Usually closer to 15.
SoNElgen,"They should look at people's stash value when wipe occurs, and everyone who has over 100mill stash value, can only run 30 scav runs the next wipe."
Automatic-Diamond256,another dirty tactic from bsg to make the pmc progression harder
CPollard187,Lol how else do you want them to raise their karma?
No_Analyst3861,Yea you kind should though? For lore sake why would they not show up.  What's the difference between a scav player and a PMC.  Nothing except for kit.  It's not like this wipe we don't treat scavs as a legitimate threat.  We treat everything as a threat.  Just cause it was a player scav doesn't make it any less shitty than dying to a PMC.
magicsevenball,"Why not? Because you don't want them to?  The AI scavs are there and do no looting, it makes sense that scavs would be looting already when your PMC shows up."
Competitive-Ad-4822,"Yall...so know that scavs would be more populated in certain maps than others depending on the location inside of tarkov. They're probably testing both server stress and reaction to having a high amount of players in one map.

 Is it harder? Yes. 

Does it mean you have to play that map differently from any other? Also yes. 

This isn't meant to be easy. Normal scavs spawn in around the same time regardless. Irl you don't get a choice of when the enemy engages you either. 

On top of that, if scavs only have a certain area they can spawn and loiter, then many building internally will be empty and only the streets themselves would have scavs. That becomes a roadblock for those inside and out if there's not an angle to deal with them. Want to push a group inside wherever but there's a row of scavs beforehand cause that's the only place they can be? Now everyone knows you're outside and they have the window advantage on you while scavs also aggro on yourself. Being able to have player scavs also crawl around makes it an all around danger to be in both streets and lighthouse."
dorekk,Yeah scav runs are insane right now.  My Interchange scav runs usually start at 37 minutes left in the raid. On Streets I've literally never spawned *after* 45 minutes.
Roninbean,"The spawns are all over the place this wipe. We get anywhere from beginning if raid to literally 7 minutes left where the only thing we can do is run directly to the extract which is super annoying when you waited 20 minutes for a scav then another 20 minutes just to get into the raid... 

Can we just get a solid 20 minutes to like.... do stuff? Why is it so random..."
Yakatoa,4 minutes is a blessing. I do Interchange and always die less than a minute after getting in.
Kuraloordi,"I thought the entire point of scav was to spawn at random time left on the game. Sometimes you get unlucky and it's less than 10mins left, so you scrape whatever you can. Sometimes you get around mid game to fight whoever is left and score some decent stuff. Equally if you are lucky, you spawn into almost fresh game so you can score big time.

Dunno why PMC who will always get the full time in raid with whatever preparation they feel required should be allowed to spend most of the raid with no threat from scavs."
BillyTheGoatBrown,I think its awesome. Leave it alone
LQuizzy,"I player scav. Its my job to find you and kill you. My opinion is we should load in with you. Not be able to loot for the first 5-10 minutes. It makes the game fun, and hard. MPO."
low83,"I absolutely love being a scav and getting a early raid, it's a chance to absolutely get the jump on pmcs or loot more shit, It's all profit either way"
Necessary_Fig_2265,The hordes of player scavs running together on streets 5 minutes into raid is shitty.
CrabBattle73,I barely even scav anymore. Scav into interchange or reserve with over 30 minutes left every time and get bulldozed by a PMC. I’m happy with the scraps but winning a fight while also worrying about FF from other player scavs is just a waste of a 15+ minute queue time
Omishjosh,I disagree
ArgumentOk1144,"My gf saw my playing tarkov, haven't played it in almost a year and a half, around the time we started dating, and I loaded her into wood with a pistol, and she died literally a minute into the game from a player scav. She then said, ""this game is stupid"""
No_Assignment_2888,"There should be a cap they can spawn at around 25 min left so its bot as annoying i mean, they nerfed loot on lighthouse and im sure one of the reasons is that u can make too much money as a scav too, now its streets but the same problem just without the rogue loot lol"
LazyTurtle2018,"I fought 3 different groups of 3 or 4 player scavs on interchange really early the other day after killing 6 pmcs. Wildly frustrating. Probably an unpopular opinion but you shouldn't be able to scav in in groups, scavs should be solo only and then you have to utilize voip if you want to find scavs to push pmcs with. Maybe duos at most cuz they are good for teaching with no risk but we have offline now for that so..."
DarkSideOfTheMind,Streets is an absolute death trap as a PMC. I think I may have extracted twice in all my raids on that map so far.
Enpallos,Been getting into streets with 40m left so yeah thats a huge problem (this is when my scav q's are actually short and not 30m long)
Zc9-Holden,So true.lots of issues right now.sound/cheaters/ingame play
blackbeans13,This old song ?
GibFreelo,For me it's always player scav death squads of 3+ people. They usually magically appear after winning a fight against a PMC early in the game.
salbris,Do you guys want short scav queues or scavs only loading in after x minutes? You can't have both...
Rare_Lifeguard_4403,"Once i said that and everyone was going crazy. They should always spawn with 10 minutes left or so, they are SCAVENGERS and you should be able to loot only what is left on the server once almos every player left"
Rare_Lifeguard_4403,And you should be able to know at what time scav players can join on each map.
MacaroonSome225,"Tarkov, where the bad guys wait till you want them to spawn"
Chonglongtime,"Because they've done it on the most SJ6-run to loot spot type maps, it makes me think they're trying to dissuade naked PMCs sprinting and shoving the best loot up their arse raid after raid. I like it and think it makes the raids more challenging from the start and there's also less chance you get a dead raid. Also think they've nerfed scav spawn ammo to help low levels v player scavs as a paca+penis helmet should tank scavs now. I'd much rather face a player scav with the potential of getting their loot than a hatchet runner with a ledx in their anus."
godofthegrid,"The problem is player scav queues are HUGE right now with new players and wipe. So to combat this they send them in throughout the raid starting earlier. Otherwise, the 10 min queue would be closer to 20-30 mins."
PutridAppointment69,"I spawned into interchange the other day, ran to power, died to a 3 man scav team. It had been maybe 6 minutes. Fun times."
egiantmirror_skilled,Bros mad he can’t kill a pscav
Medical-Vegetable522,Sounds like a skill issue
NoTransportation7530,"Keeps me on my toes, I like it"
CachimanRD,"Nah i think scavs should be in that early, makes the game more interesting.
I like spawning in that early so i can actually hunt down pmcs. otherwise scavs are a boring “get in and get out”."
Razihelz,"Idk, I kind of like that player scavs can spawn early. As a pmc it adds a bit of variety in what my squad has to lookout for. And as a scav it gives you more options when scav'ing into a raid, do you go for loot, push for pvp if you have a good gun, etc. It also makes scav runs more dangerous, I've been killed by pmcs more with the early spawns."
SugahKain,Wah wah stop complaining and git gud kid
m1n1nut,"Oh my word, go call the wahmulance .. this sub just cries about literally everything."
Skuld8989,"But then you know for sure no player scav are in raid until a specific time, I believe Nikita wants to threat to always be there. Not 10 mins into raid, not 20 mins into raid, always. 
Plus scav timers would be twice as long if they had to wait, and getting scavs into raid is more important  then you not wanting scav around to BSG"
540565,Then compared to interchange where you got 10 minutes left and 2-3 minutes is spent running to extract.
oriaven,"I suggest killing pmcs, scavs, and yes, even player scavs."
underratedcanuck15,Wah fucking wah
Friskybullets,Idk what scav runs you're getting when I play scav I spawn with 13 minutes left in raid every time
DmMeUrTits-IfItsCool,Scav shouldn't let you pick the map and should have a 7min buffer before scavs can load in.
Aceylah,This happens every wipe. I 100% agree scavs shouldn't spawn in the first half of the raid. They should be coming in for scraps not completing with pmcs a few mins in.
bootyswag-,Would you rather this or 10-15 min scav load time?
babyarmnate,Agreed. I don’t know how this hasn’t been addressed. I avoided lighthouse/interchange last wipe for this very reason.
NoAcanthocephala5350,On interchange they down inside the mall. So you don’t even have time to loot a cache or two you need to sprint inside or else a scav will kill you or already loot everything. It’s like the forget the word of there AI Stands for scavenger
pennyclip,"Scav spawns have been real flippin early this wipe! Streets and Interchange I might as well just be spawn killing PMCs as they load in. And not like here and there, nearly every single scav raid is like that. If it was more mixed it would be fine, but I feel like I'm just PVPing for high tier loot at that point with a shitty character. 

They certainly don't release a lot of opinions on the design. I wish they would. I feel like this is another case of someone thought player scavs early adds to the threat of the raid for players. It does, but not in the best way. If every corner is infested by someone who spawned in front of you with a shotgun it's just not that fun for players to risk any valuable loot. Which means more players fight less and get out of raid quicker. Feel like adding some thunderdick AI, that don't sit in a corner, around good loot locations with roaming is a much more immersive and fun experience.

Yes, I personally don't get TOO bothered as a PMC by player scavs in corners every raid. But your average timmy might be, and that's who we are all wanting to be in the game for more than a week."
straight_lurkin,There should be an 8-10min grace period before player scavs can spawn in imo but then again the first 10 mins would probably be super quiet until player scavs start spawning in again
qleptt,I lived for 20 seconds once and was killed by a player scav
Semper_faith,I thought player scavs didn't spawn until around half time into the raid..what the fuck
MrPatri0t,Get better. Player Scav’s aren’t that hard.
Khronus6,"I don't mean to sound like an elitist but I have scav'd once this wipe and last wipe barely at all. I've played 6 wipes total and the last 5 have ended with a stash value of over 100 million. A scav spawning i nat the start of my raids or half way through is all the same. Just blast them and loot them.

Against what is popular, I use the best flesh damage ammo 95% of the time so I expect to demolish every scav and scav player I see."
LinkinBreak,"I almost exclusively scav in on Interchange. When I get in and there is 35+ minutes left, I know I'm going to die from some random angle. Between 15-25 minutes is the sweet spot as I can still scavenge the map and still possibly find some PMCs to either kill or at least try to use the shared extract. Especially since I get more scav rep for the extract than killing them.

As a PMC, I don't want to have to deal with a bunch of other PMCs and a group of player scavs as well. That's just not fun."
Empty-Confection-513,"Spawned into a Scav on interchange last night with 37 on the clock. At that point it's not even fun for me as a Scav either, sure a lot of look but I spawned with a pistol and a Tbag I can't exactly put up a proper fight..."
ZeusDaMoose,"This is tarkov, home of the scavs. Why should you, the trespasser, get a free pass to roam their streets without restitution."
uniqueeveryone,i read somewhere player scavs spawn as soon as the first pmc dies
PckMan,"They're not free high value pmc runs. Whenever I spawn in early raid as a scav I'm pretty much certain I'm gonna die and try to avoid high traffic areas for most of the raid to hope to get out alive, and usually I don't. What's a scav with a clapped out gun with shit ammo gonna do on a fresh raid? Unless you're a very good player, the answer is not much. The chances are that if you spawn in early raid the high value areas will be full of players and you're at a disadvantage. And if they're not? That comes down to luck really, some times nobody goes there because everyone thinks they'll be highly contested and assumes chads will be there, but that can also happen joining in late raid. I've found good loot in high value areas as a scav joining near the end many times, it's just pure random chance that nobody went there."
Prestigious_Body_997,"Not to mention that the scavs are spawning in new spots. You think you are fighting pmc only to find out at the end it was a scav. For instance, woods between the crumbling wall and bunker near the UN exit. And, these scavs don't miss at night."
Nokami93,On Streets are scavs literally spawning with PMCs it's absolutely hilarious.
Significant_Lime7370,"Unrelated vent, was on customs upstairs Crack house and got hole punched by an ai scav who put one through my class four chest with the mount MG through the green glass lol. About 1 min into raid"
Separate-Advance-453,This has to be an easy fix for them to implement - agree though scavs should be getting the last 11-13 minutes max on raids. Those that have awful rep bc they’ve been on killing sprees should get 3-5 minutes
BlackPrincessPeach_,Ur right player scavs should spawn in the millisecond a rogue dies and on top of the corpse.
ke2_1-0,Probably a result of the community trying about to long scav matching times  no?
Aggots86,"That’s the main reason I don’t play pmc or scav on lighthouse. When I’m a scav I don’t want pmc’s and when I’m pmc, I don’t want scavs!"
Cpt_Garlic,"Weaklings die, big deal"
Maxalite,I’m suprised you even stay that long. I do my quests and go to hotspots and get out. I understand when you have a long gunfight with other PMCs but my thought process to this game is get out before the map is riddled with scav players
robinjinxed,Gotta git gud! I actually like that player scavs are loading in quicker gives me a chance to get some more loot from spots they’ve visited and nothing decent gets rammed up their butts! Plus they have inferior gear with inferior ammo. PMC should clap player scavs 99% of the time. Higher fence rep should give longer scav raids else what’s the point! I rarely scav but prefer killing players in PvP whether they be player scavs or PMCs to killing AI.
Spitfire15,There's bad guys in PvP shooter game :(
Win_98SE,Bro you can fight player PMCs at raid start but not a player scav? Major cope post
jsylvis,Waaaah
CarlosMingos22,I like to camp on the outside corner of oli looking to emercom and all I kill there nowdays are player scavs that sometimes appear even before I can get comfortable on my rat spot.
Marvelous_Mushroom,"Honestly I would be okay with them getting rid of player scavs. Only running scavs because I was too scared to pmc was one of the biggest hurdles to getting better when I was a new player. I’ll bet the average gigachad per lobby count would go down a bit too, since they would be diluted with scav mains forced to pmc."
lucasantarella,Sounds like a skill issue...jkjk
CoatAlternative1771,I just don’t think scavs should ever have potentially first dibs on loot.
AgileSatisfaction260,There has always been a chance to get in as a scav fresh like that it’s tarkov expect to die
Cptnslapah0e,"Streets difficulty reads “insane” so if you aren’t ready for it, go play a map that says “normal”"
