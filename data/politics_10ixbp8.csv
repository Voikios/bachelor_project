The2500,We still calling him George Santos? Didn't he fail a congressional roll call after they called that name?
SupermarketOverall73,He should be heckled everyday incessantly.
FuckOffEveryone_,George Santos is an anagram for Strange Goose.
oDDmON,"Embattled?  He got fucking committee assignments, fercryin’outloud.  McCarthy would keep him on even if he was stiff, stinkin’ and drawing flies."
Special_FX_B,"Perfectly reasonable. He’s a fraud. He’s a criminal. He deserves to be harassed everywhere he goes for the rest of his life. He could have said, in effect, ‘you caught me, I lied” and resigned . He didn’t and that makes scorn and ridicule fair game. If he does it down the road.?Too late. I’m not condoning anything physical, just words."
epidemicsaints,">""I look forward to serving the people. The one thing I'll say is the media, we've received plenty of complaints about you guys,"" Santos said.

LOL imagine a human being picking up the phone this week to contact George Santos to complain about ""the media."""
,[removed]
TechyDad,Hey come on guys. Leave him alone. He just singlehandedly landed the plane after fighting off a group of alien invaders!!!
Objective-War-1961,"Or as George Santos recalls, he was cheered at LaGuardia after safely landing that plane on the Potomac."
johnnybiggles,"Ahh... Testing his shamelessness.  He's Republican, so his shamelessness is near endless, but we shall see what he's made of and if he can hold out."
,[deleted]
Kevaldes,Good. There should be people hounding him every moment.
internetbrowser23,He deserves this but frankly many many more politicians deserve this treatment. There are at least a dozen or so republicans who were at the literal insurrection and are still walking around completely fine.
zero_blammos_given,">The one thing I'll say is the media, we've received plenty of complaints about you guys,"" Santos said.

From who? You've been forwarding all of your constituent communications to other members of congress."
SporkOfThor,"I just want to shout at him ""Who ARE you?!"""
TheDakoe,"He doesn't deserve such things, especially at an airport he built himself with his own two hands after inventing the airplane. One of the greatest minds of the last 300 years and gets treated soo poorly. ^^/s"
allgonetoshit,"Damn, now even people on the left are heckling drag queens? /s"
Oldguru-Newtricks,"This guy is mentally twisted and a perfect fit for the republican party. As someone mentioned above, that I agree with, Mccarthy wants this clown front and center because it takes a lot of the focus and heat off the other deranged people in their party and the party itself."
Prowandering,Why is reality so unreal...
EddyBuddard,"The problem is, heckling doesn't work with psychopaths."
atomic_gingerbread,"> Santos was heckled by someone who yelled ""con artist"" as he walked through baggage claim

The heckler has a point.  He was elected to Congress, after all."
Barcelona539,As he should be.
CarlosFer2201,Imagine disrespecting a WW2 veteran
Imacatdoincatstuff,"Ya funny, don’t usually think of New Yorkers as world-class chumps. Some of ‘em gotta be personally offended. And, not happy this is their dude for the next two years. What’s he gonna be able to do for them."
iRedditAlreadyyy,"I’m curious how he just landed and then told reporters as he’s walking through the airport that he’s “been in the district all week”. 

He. Just. Landed?"
TitoJackson5,"This is the way.  I don’t live in his district, so I can’t vote for his opponent.  But I can sure as hell give him a piece of my mind in public.  We should all be doing this more."
SailingBacterium,How could people heckle this man who both marched with MLK Jr. and saved the crew of Apollo 13??
sailorpaul,"Every single other Republican congressman — and especially Kevin McCarthy — should be asked about every one of George Santos’ lies at EVERY event.  Every question.  Every event. Every hall walk.  

If they can’t show their faces then they can’t get their disgusting messages accross about defunding social programs and attempts to hold the debt ceiling hostage.

I’m a republican, but I will find a way to vote straight D until this shite stops."
ZETA_RETICULI_,"Reporter; was your mother at the World Trade Center. 

Santos: look that’s not how you conduct an interview 

Acting like he has morals."
circle_logic,"Alright someone check on the GOP. If they're spending this much time and effort making sure this dickcheese is always on the front of the stage getting heckled, then whatever they're cooking up is so outrageously horrible but too far along to stop properly. 


Budget cuts? Tax Breaks? Penning a government shutdown for a deal? 

Someone please check on those numbnuts."
SageIrisRose,this creep is loving every single moment of attention
JediTigger,"Poor guy. After he’d saved that flight and its passengers by ditching the jet in the Hudson, too."
misplacedsidekick,"This guy is just amazing. He keeps getting called out as lie after lie is discovered and instead of throwing himself on the mercy of the court, he just doubles-down and is a bigger dick. Democrats don't like him. His own party doesn't like him. His constituents only voted for him because he had an 'R' next to his name and they're dying to vote for a different 'R'. Nobody trusts him, nobody will employ him, and nobody would be dumb enough to give him money as a private citizen when he gets kicked out of the House. Either by being forced out or losing in the next primary.

Things will end badly for George and I'm just tickled to see what the world has in store for him."
mynameisalso,It's amazing his opponent couldn't find any of this.
NoahPransky,"He's honestly probably one of only about five members of Congress who would be broadly recognized at LGA.  

I don't even know if Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would be recognized much at his own home airport.  Pretty remarkable."
Euclidian1,"Stand by folks, big Hollywood movie  starring Leonardo DiCaprio, “Catch me I’ll be damned!” in the works! -stand by for details!!"
PlantainCreative8404,"I genuinely hope he shows up on the floor of the House in full drag and performs a show, the lead song being ""Fuck my District, they're all idiots.""

Welcome to todays distopian GQP. You can't get elected unless you're off the rails crazy."
bcallihan513,"Embattled?! Embattled?! 

“…beset by problems or difficulties” **that are a direct result of being a lying asshole** 

Don’t feel sorry for this nozzle. He brought every stinking ounce of it down upon himself. And the GOP says “Eh.”. 

Nice government you got there USA"
GeneDangle,Embattled is a cool way of saying lying piece of shit scumbag
clorox2,I ❤️ NYers.
zootsuitbeatnick,"Damn shame.

He deserves so much worse."
cpray2345,He should just be ignored. It's another republican liar trying to lie his way out of trouble. He needs to be expelled from Congress!
_bigbubba_,Lock him up!
Aschrod1,“Representative *we aren’t sure of his real name or status as a us citizen at this time*  gets well deserved confrontation  from constituents and concerned citizens “
wow_button,Isn't he also not eligible to be congressman? As in he hasn't been a citizen for long enough? (And that's assuming his marriage wasn't a citizenship scam)
Jimbo_1252,Did he claim to be the pilot?
Czeris,"Kiss me, I'm Ire-ish."
LazyDescription3407,"He’s a trickster who has gotten in over his head. “Santos” faces a huge amount of scrutiny now, he has sunk himself."
,“My middle name is LaGuardia.”
andytdesigns1,"You mean after he landed the plane after the pilot passed out, and after landing Dr.Santos revived the man with a pen and stapler"
drunken1,">	I’ve been in the district the whole week

Mother fucker, you are literally at the airport getting off from a plane that’s just landed from DC!!"
keele,"This dude gets off on the media attention, congrats Long Island, you did real good"
ProdigalSheep,"I read that as “Battle Rapper George Santos” and thought, “sure, why not?”"
elriggo44,Why would anyone heckle the congressman at the airport he built with his own bare hands? That’s messed up.
silentjay01,That's no way to treat the man who had to land that big commercial airliner all by himself after the entire flight crew took ill and could no longer work the controls!
f0gax,"Is this guy pretty much just trying out the ""if I lie enough, people will stop caring"" trick?"
cmotdibbler,Don't let up. Drum this lying POS out of office.
Independent_Prune_35,"The bigger issue is the republican party? They will accept anyone who will vote as they say too! Follow my party lines and you can do as you please, we will back you!"
Utterlybored,You think people would have respect for a seven time Olympic gold medalist and Nobel laureate.
Cool_Set4546,The party is so used to telling lies and being immoral that they don't care as long as he plays ball.
WittyPerception3683,This guy actually flashed a white supremacists sign. And yet that's not the most significant thing about him
osrsEzille,rep kinzinger if you are listening - please bring KitaraCare to the floor as the GOP's health care package alternative
thinkingofwon,Where’s George?
,nice
ElderFlour,He’d need a conscience for heckling to work.
zombieblackbird,I'm convinced that he was handpicked to be so outlandish that everyone would see the others are closer to normal. Or maybe he just went wild once Bolsonaro lost the election and couldn't fund the handlers anymore.
coffeemonkeypants,'embattled' fuck outta here
Robinhood4real,New Yorkers know a thing or two about conmen.
Little_birds_mommy,"""Guys look, this is not how you conduct an interview,"" said Santos, because he would know, having won a Pulitzer and a Polk Award in journalism! Didn't we hear that from him later in the same interview?"
tpatmaho,But why -- when he's returning from Stockholm after winning the Nobel Peace Prize?
AmeliasGrammy,I hope they follow and heckle him his entire time in office.
2u3e9v,May he be heckled until he is charged in Brazil
bittwix,He wants to talk about immigrants? We should have kept him from crossing the border.
LudovicoSpecs,"This should happen to him everywhere he goes. Everywhere he dines. Everywhere he urinates.

Nothing physical. But he should be mocked and shunned everywhere, every time."
,[removed]
HumanRuse,"Republicans love to use the word ""Fake"".  

Fake Senator Santos."
joblagz2,"you have to admire how a person can lie about everything, get caught and have zero shame about it, continue to lie and not break a sweat.. i mean that is goddamn something"
BonIsDead,"Good. Don't give him a moment of peace. He should be afraid and uncomfortable being outside. If you disagree, maybe don't be a white supremacist piece of lying shit, I dunno"
iuytrefdgh436yujhe2,"How's he embattled, exactly? Republicans are still behind him, conservative voters are still behind him. He's a standard bearer and represents the sort of life they want to lead."
Medical_Ad_4747,"He’s a disgusting joke, lair"
AceCombat9519,Has to be done because of his lies and controversies
orangeguitarpick,"There are no consequences for lying, so why would he or any republicans stop? Hell, that's their main form of ""governing."" Bullshitting the people to make their own lives better."
DaisyScorsese,"I heard he was actually the one flying the plane, and that he briefly WAS the plane."
Salaas,Tbh people who should be held to account are those who voted for him.
Truffans,But is George even Anthony’s real name?
theepi_pillodu,What's going behind the scenes? This guy is enough of the distraction.
blanksix,"""Embattled."" 

*Stop hitting yourself. Stop* hitting *yourself*."
SuperstitiousPigeon5,The airport named after him?
Roook36,"I don't know why he doesn't disguise himself out in public. A long wig, a nice long dress and makeup and no one will look twice."
YYYY,"Misleading article.  It was Anthony Devolder, Anthony Zabrovsky or was it  Kitara Ravache?  Is he even a US citizen?"
WolfgangDS,"Lying hypocrite that he is, he deserves it."
scroopynoopersdid911,Embattled? That implies he didn’t ask for this.
Schiffy94,I can't believe he would get heckled at the airport he built with his own two hands
Bluerecyclecan,Guy is a scumbag but he knows how things work. This will eventually all fall to the wayside and people will forget until the next shiny object comes along. He’s playing the long game.
CaptValentine,That's just the LaGuardia experience
kickstand,"I just want to know who is funding Santos, who enabled Santos to run, and what their motives are.

Also, what kind of campaign did his opponent (Robert Zimmerman) run, that he didn't find this stuff out?

I actually have relatives in his district, and I know it well. It's a moderately conservative district (""Rockefeller Republican""), but not crazy. They hoodwinked by this guy."
DougBalt2,He probably yelled at people and said “I’m not George Santos!”
The2500,"I was sort of looking forward to the next presidential election, but I think it's going to boil down to every lie he tells is ""fake news"" and republicans will steam forward with that unmolested."
Gobug2006,Is Santos the son of Chuck Norris?
Downbadfckboi,This is 100% fake news… he only lands at JFK
einsteinremembered,Not so much a con artist as a con maestro!
Equivalent_Hat_7220,"In America, you really can be anything"
litebrite93,That’s probably not even his real name
zenos_dog,Who knew New Yorkers would react so negatively? /s
Ok_Bag_4135,Who on earth would work for this sociopath?
ActNo8507,I won’t eat any grilled cheese sandwiches until he’s deported.
Ilikedagss,"He will be heckled everywhere in public where he can’t hide from the actual public, the gOP can only protect him in congress… what a miserable shameless fraud."
allen_6108,He is simply trying to wait this out and hopefully it will all go away when the next big story breaks. I personally hope he is hounded till he breaks.
Exit56,“Embattled“ is doing a lot of work in that headline…
Squirrel_Chucks,">Embattled Rep. George Santos heckled after landing at LaGuardia Airport

They're just jealous that it's about to be renamed Santos Airport"
mikec20,"Thats ok, he invented the heckle and gets a royalty everytime.  So he says."
Riyu1225,The dude should be heckled until he fesses up to his BS.
The_Doolinator,The man doesn’t deserve a single moment’s peace until he slinks back to whatever cave he crawled out of.
duz10,"Embattled? How about grifting, scamming, or lying? Embattled is too good of a look for this guy."
jonhon0,That photo they use of him looks like his drag persona.
foxymoron,"~~Embattled~~ Compulsive liar, George Santos..."
Quick_Care_3306,"Misleading headline, clickbait. One person yelling out is not newsworthy. 
Do we really need to pump up anything about this guy? His actual actions are bad enough. No need to turn 1 person yelling out into ""heckling""."
ZooCrazy,Displays a lack of honesty and is unwilling to give up his seat. Where is one’s moral compass? There are a significant # of GOP who are reluctant to speak out against his behavior in order to maintain their seat in The House. Simply Pathetic!!!
horkus1,"I honestly feel like only 2 things are certain about him: 1) he is a human being and 2) he is an elected congressman. Everything else seems to be up for debate. 

I hope his life is just as exhausting as it seems. It’s the least he deserves."
free2bk8,I say play “Who are you?” By the WHO.
Number-Thirteen,Don't let him live anything down. Follow him and shame him constantly. Not that he has any shame...
Principal_Insultant,"In public office for the GOP, priesthood, and being a cop seem to be the only professions in the US where truth doesn't matter and crimes are but a minor flaw, to be repented away come Sunday morning."
Rhodehouse93,Embattled is the softest possible word I could think of to describe this man.
Sean6949,Let’s create a Go Fund Me to pay for his trip to Rio (one way)
xmagusx,"""Embattled"" seems an unnecessarily charitable description of this lying idiot."
celerydonut,"What a disgrace this shell of a person is. Have some self respect you twit. I can only see this ending horrible for him, not to get too dark, but he’s caught in the world’s spotlight with a dozen serious lies. The Republican Party is a mess. Hoping he’s the straw. This country is fucked atm."
knowledgeable_diablo,"How could he be heckled?. 
Has he invented it yet??"
jigsaur1,"He's just a Walter Mitty character. Once knew one myself, nickname of 'Tom Terrific'. He told me he'd just fallen out of a 20th floor window and managed to grab a window ledge on the 9th as he fell, saving his life. True story. Looked me right in the eye when he said it too. Totally straight face. His achievements were massive, extraordinary and totally false. He wanted admiration and wasn't going to let truth stand in the way. 'George' seems to be much the same as good ol' Tom. Lies serve a purpose and become the truth - to him, at least."
Twigling,"Just another member of the Republican party, the home of greedy psychopaths, sociopaths, narcissists, egotists, thieves, con artists, bullshitters and liars. All of them should be locked up in mental institutions and not making decisions which affect the lives of millions."
Modal_Window,"""Santos' Twitter account has since been restored. In one of his latest tweets, he posted about immigration and claimed Democrats don't want to fix it.""

Let's investigate marriage fraud then, him being married to a woman while announcing an engagement to his boyfriend. Marriage of convenience for the purpose of obtaining residency is not legal."
cwn01,"Republicans, really, do something to improve your image. Republicans are currently looking like the Yahoo and con-men Party."
I_divided_by_0-,You would think the 7 time Daytona 500 winner would rather drive from DC to NYC
Substantial_Sun_8477,All politicians lie. He just happens to be really fucking terrible at it. He is just one of many scum bags in office. Voters need to scrutinize the politicians more. They won’t though. They’ll vote party lines regardless of how much a shit the human running is. Perpetuate the hypocrisy.
PoptartMartt,Why is he still not in jail ?
xeonicus,The fact that Republicans have embraced this guy says a lot.  What a garbage fire.
Ribbwich_daGod,He just got off a plane from visiting Santa Claus and the Pope
RoburLC,He's a piece.
Fryceratops,He should be heckled everywhere he goes.
Dependent_Release834,Why are we acting like this dude doesn’t get rock hard being heckled? He lives for this
CeleryStickBeating,"""This isn't how you conduct an interview.""  ANOTHER LIE!"
Macd7,"Yeah, He seems like the kind of person who’d be devastated. Probably forgot about it in baggage claim"
BachthovenIB,No I’m the real George Santos or Jorge Santoise or Georg von Santeüsch or Georges St. Oseaux or Georgy Alexandreiovich Santoskiy or Gigi St. Oish
castle_grapeskull,They’re just mad he flew the plane blindfolded while figuring out world peace.
mrpickleby,"We get the government we deserve.  The people of NY03 voted him in.  Yes, the guy is a total liar and a loser.  But seriously, was there no scrutiny?  If this doesn't get people to look more closely at their local politics, what will?"
gustoreddit51,It annoys me how he refuses to resign considering how easily Al Franken folded his tent.
Imaspinkicku,"Who cares, the media clearly has learned nothing since Donald Trump."
Odd_Status_9326,"GOP's new candidate slogan should be ""The crazier the better""."
GhostofABestfriEnd,He's a blatant liar operating as a servant/representative of the people. He should be arrested. The goalposts for integrity have been pushed so far we actually TOLERATE our public servants saying whatever the fuck they want with irrefutable evidence they aren't acting in good faith. Do we let lawyers just make up laws during trial?
berlinblades,Fred armisen is a shoe in for the inevitable movie about this joker.
malakon,What name do they use to heckle him ?
Hour-Watch8988,NYC stays undefeated
jamesey10,he doesn't give a shit. he's a psychopath who got what he wanted. he won't face any punishment. he'll align with the party and get their pragmatic goals accomplished. along the way he'll enrich himself. he'll happily be heckled the rest of his life for this.
spacenerd-roadkill,"Serious question, and explain this to me like I’m in 6th grade. How is this not considered fraud? Definition from my very brief Google search is “wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain.” This situation all sounds wrongful and for his financial and personal gain."
Allisonosaurus,Go heckle the sacks of shit that elected him.
MacNewton,I would of push my cane in front of him yelling sorry I’m old. Are you ok buddy. Ha ha
buried_lede,He seems to feed off this. He is pretty smooth.
giabollc,"Don’t hate the player hate the game.  Why aren’t any politicians coming up with some sort of remedy to this so it doesn’t happen again.  Oh right, they love their dark money campaign contribution and lies as much as anyone"
OneMan_OneBeard,"Here’s a hard pill to swallow:

The Democratic Party (my party) is by far the more virtuous party in every way. We’re also the more stupid and it’s not even close. We can bang our heads off the wall until we knock ourselves out demanding Republicans do the right thing, but they won’t. They never will and yet we keep stepping up to the plate like, “this time it’s going to be different.” And it never is, because we’re idiots. 

When the time comes for the next Democrat to fuck up and we immediately suppress the urge to lop his head off and ask questions later. 

Let’s calm down and think about this. We need to keep our focus on the overarching goal and use that to weigh out the appropriate punishment. We don’t need to be the more outwardly facing, idealistically moral party. I’d rather win and come out a little dirtier then lose and look squeaky clean doing so. 

The overarching goal of every liberal political (not just ours) is to live in a just society. These ideals need to be grounded in logic and reason. Most importantly we need to loosen our death grip on moral absolutism. 

We axed Al Franken expecting republicans to do the same thing. They clearly haven’t and they never will. I’d rather have Al Franken - his faults and all - in the Senate than any one of the many “George Santos(es?)” the Republican Party slip into office. 

Trust me. History is full of the many broken eggs of failed liberal movements, before they became the omelettes we now see before us. We don’t have to repeat many of their trials and tribulations, because we can learn from them. 

NOTE: English is my first and only language and I don’t do it good when I’m stoned. So cut me some slack, ok?"
Michael_In_Cascadia,I was hoping for a 'slam'.
GoldBreakr,It’s funny to see the GOP supporting a flamer. They must be just choking on it.
alroprezzy,"So reporters wrote an article about how they asked Santos questions and didn’t get answers?

Cool."
Discokruse,"Most politician's biggest fear is assassination by gunfire.  A fitting punishment for Santos, when in his own district,, would repeated glitter bombs thrown at him, consistently and in perpetuity, not to hurt him in anyway, but to erode his sense of safety bypassing his security detail.  Daily cleansing of glitter will remind him how he fucked up his life by grifting a rep seat.

Firing a non-damaging splash of glitter never hurt a single Ravache."
Trying2Understand69,Serves him right.  He's lucky he ain’t in prison with somebody like Adibisi.
SnapmareJesus,Lying means nothing anymore.
