traceylking117,I can’t disagree with this. I was molested at church youth camp. The only time I went. My mom wanted me to make friends. I was miserable and got molested. Never again. I would NEVER send my own kids on one of these trips.
slowlysoslowly,"I had zero physical abuse situations at church camp, but I can confirm the emotional manipulation is OUT OF CONTROL and very disturbing to think back on."
mkt853,If you're going to do stuff like this you need to be loud about it. Make sure every time you are interviewed/asked about this bill you mention children being abused in churches. The religious right will be forced into a corner of having to defend actual pedophiles and groomers.
Captain_CatDad,*Jesus Camp has entered the chat*
Espritsoul,"I grew up in church and church camps, I got an undergrad in Christian theology right out of high school. I was fortunate that my experiences were largely positive. I was licensed to preach in a major denomination. 

20 years later, and an atheist, I couldn’t agree with this more. No child should be taught the fear of hell, self, and everything else that comes along. I’ve been 20 years unprogramimg my childhood. Teaching children that they’ll suffer eternally is nothing short of abuse"
Party-Height-6830,"I was sent to many of these camps as a kid and everything you hear is true. Two-week camps with church services (speaking in tongues, glossolalia everywhere) three times a day, often 1-2 hours at a time. You returned home utterly brainwashed. I stopped going to them when I was 14. First one I went to was probably at age 10. Think the movie ""Jesus Camp"", except they never did trot out a cardboard cut out figure of a politician for us to pray over like in that documentary. EVERYTHING else was ... not just spot on, not just a dramatization, everything in that fucking documentary was real and I experienced the same shit, just another campground and \*slightly\* different demonization ... oops, I mean denomination.

**These camps should absolutely be shut down. Change my mind.**"
work4work4work4work4,"Since everyone is sharing their horror stories, I would share that one of my only positive experiences with religion as a youth was basically at church camp where I realized it was largely the edifices of churches and the terrible behavior of my fellow humans that represented those places that shaped my negative feelings when it came to religion.

The bill being used as an example of failure is fitting for a lot of the same reasons."
XueShiLong,"toldya those frightwinger lunatics should be more careful about their bans, coz they can be turned around on *you* LOL

Don't like drag queen storytime? No more bullshit biblecamp then :)"
gulfpapa99,"Time to end childhood religious indoctrination.  Teach a child how to think, not what to think."
Necessary_Row_4889,"I went to a Jewish summer camp. It was privately owned and really other than offering synagogue on the weekends to kids who wanted to go and the food being Kosher there wasn’t anything religious, but it was specifically designed to cater to people of a specific faith, well and me my parents misread some stuff which is how a Catholic ended up there.It was extremely secular, but at the same time not really and it seems like something that could create loopholes, not because it was Jewish, but because it was supposedly a secular camp but by catering to those of a religious bent I could see it becoming exactly what they want to shut down."
Byronzionist,"As an athiest, i say good.

But this is NOT going to be good publicity for swing voters."
Mysteryman64,"I'm a raging atheist, but this is such a blatant first amendment issue that you'd have to be an idiot not to see it. I understand it's a ""gotcha"" move to protest the anti-drag stuff, but the problem is that they're just gonna crow about how sexuality isn't a legally protected class on a federal level and continue to not give a shit. The gotcha doesn't work when they have no shame about the situation. 

This is just meat that they can throw to their base and accomplishes literally nothing because its also such a clear cut first amendment violation."
Goat_Wizard_Doom_666,Don't forget the pedophilia.
jtl3000,"I went to church camp , it was my only outlet to meet kids my age from different towns and ironically teach me there was different ideas and secular music and also help me develop other interest besides church.  Lot of kids used it for what I did.  Seeing ppl from all walks of life by means of church transportation"
scanvector,"I get the visceral appeal of this and the point they're trying to make. But this is exactly the sort of thing that the right pulls out to suggest Democrats are ""anti-religion"" and only drives moderate voters away. It's absolutely shit praxis. 

We need everyone we can get to recognize and hold off the rise of fascism. Pushing away fence sitters and moderates doesn't help. Instead they should be proposing bills defending free expression and protecting LGBT people from state interference."
Stock_Rush2555,"I was sexually abused at youth camp. As a counsellor. 14 year old counsellor to ""troubled kids"", many of whom were my age. Abused by a man 11 years older than me, trying to help me pray away my gayness. (after molesting me) 

Went on for years. These places are evil, even when run with the best intentions. Sometimes the best intentions are evil, but too ignorant to realize it"
Shnazzytwo,"If these people really care about Child Safety and indoctrination, they would be on board with this. Religious groups are the biggest source of danger to children, period."
ventricles,"I went to church camp as a kid. Shit was weird.

I was in California so it was a bit lighter than some of the Deep South speaking in tongues things.. but they still really laid on the guilt for not being Christian enough. I always felt guilty, because I loved being with people and going to camp, but never was as in to Jesus as everyone else. 

I finally got a bit more education and experience and left the church the summer I turned 15 and refused to ever step foot in one again.

I kept going to my secular/ocean summer camp until I was 17 though. I still loved camp."
mces97,Call em what they are. Groomers. The GOP supposedly hates groomers.
bodyworks,Going after actual groomers (both sexual and ideological). Awesome.
HSTsGhost-72,Tit for tat GOP.
kandoras,Kids are infinitely more likely to get abused by a priest than they are by a drag queen reading a book in the library.
ThereminLiesTheRub,Just tit for tat
ghambone,"Growing up in the Christianist grooming Cult, and having adults trying to trick us into thinking the shite in the Bible was true, have to agree. The Cancer of Christianism is a metastasizing disease of stupidity."
Agent_Velcoro,Every democrat should be as loud about this as the right is about drag queens.
criptohore,"FIANLLY, someone calling it what it is.
Grooming."
OttersEatFish,"Most Christian churches have nothing to do with actual Christianity, especially in the US.

Every year the number of people who identify as religious drops and yet new churches are going up everywhere. Somewhere along the way someone is fleecing people, and it’s all tax free."
sweetBrisket,The real groomers.
EivorIsle,Finally! The real monsters!
Immortal-one,Make churches adults only. You have to be 18 before going to church. The language their textbook uses alone should give it an “R” rating
MyPasswordIs222222,"If you haven't yet, watch Jesus Camp.  There's nothing there about abuse... but the indoctrination is crazy.

FlannelFall,I grew up going to church camp. I looked forward to going every summer. I made a lot of friends and it helped me to not be as shy. I’m very thankful my parents gave me the opportunity to go. I had a choice. I made a decision to accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior when I got older. I hate that this is the way people feel about it. No one in my youth group had a bad experience
sambull,It's full of child sex grooming self proclaimed 'hot youth pastors'
Tyndael87,They aren't wrong.
Scarlet109,Correct.
Seraphim_The_Fox,"Considering what has happened at many of them, past and present, I could agree with this."
badbytes,Fight fire with fire
TheYakster,It’s about time.
King_Dong_Ill,I like the idea but this is likely a violation of the 1st amendment.
omghorussaveusall,"I feel one hundred percent ok saying that far more kids have been harmed by religion than by rainbow flags, pride parades, and drag shows."
Baxtaxs,"when i went to church camp in 7th grade everybody was getting finger banged on the bus at night on the way there.

then on sunday you had like a huge jesus indoctrination night and everybody cried.

good times."
theoceanencircled,"I disagree. My own sentimentality aside (bc my memories of church camp are overwhelmingly positive), for some kids, that’s the only place they’ll EVER connect with people outside of their bubble. Someone will have different ideals than them and that’s where the conversation starts."
flyingcars,This is so currently relevant for me. I have been researching summer camps to suggest to my son. So many of them are religious affiliated. My kid is not religious and he would probably think the evangelical emotional manipulation stuff was so bizarro world. I really want to believe that the camps affiliated with the Presbyterians or Episcopals are ok and not overly indoctrinating?
Apprehensive_Rub3897,"The State Senator proposing the legislation had this to say about her own bill.

> This is an amendment that I will use to make a point about the underlying bill, LB371, which bans all-ages drag shows. It won’t pass, **I would withdraw it if it had the votes to pass**. It’s a device to make a point. We need not clench nor worry."
Commercial_Board6680,My brother was sexually molested at the church community center where we all hung out as minors. Don't understand why these scum still get tax exemptions.
vcjester,The original groomers.
JRR_Not_Tolkien,The church should turn the camps into communities for those in need. Since that’s the Christian thing to do or whatever.
CactiiAnus,Bout time y’all clapped back
Ok-Ease7090,It should be real. Religion is mass delusion. We shouldn’t let them indoctrinate children with superstition.
Endorkend,"100% the people that are doing a lot of ""for the children"" shite demonizing LGBTQ+ over unproven and entirely made up claims will stand 100% against actually doing something ""for the children"" over repeated long term factual information."
ardamass,Omg this would be amazing if passed.
mx1701,"Yeah this goes against ""and the free exercise thereof"" part of the first amendment..."
Caboos20,I went to these camps for 4 years.  Every year a cop car would show up randomly some night after dinner. When we kids asked what was going on we were always told “it’s not your concern”. Yeah um a cop showing up at a fucking remote mountain camp at night is pretty damn concerning.  The next morning all the adult would be whispering thing like “I had no idea they were like that” so not very subtle any now with an adult mind I know what was going on. Fucking perverts
Dr_Tacopus,"Absolutely.  Republicans, pay attention!  Here’s your grooming and indoctrination."
schiav0wn3d,"Yeah. My youth camp counselor exposed himself to our cabin every day, saying that’s how it is in the army. I mean, he didn’t touch us or make us look but it was weird as hell this grown ass man was getting naked in front of a bunch of 9 year olds. I was ready to leave on day 2. Also the stupid counselor would make us fold all our stuff every day (like we’re in the army) but that made all of our wet towels smell like mold… cause they needed to be hung up. 

Fuck camps in general, doesn’t need to be religious to be weird"
QuarantineNudist,"From the article: ""She proposed the amendment to make a point. The penalties and language echo a Republican bill to ban drag shows for anyone under 19.""

ITT: serious people agreeing, with scars to show."
rostoffario,I wish more politicians would stand against the religious right and finally tax churches.
omgpickles63,"Disclaimer: I am a Christian and went to youth camps.

I think there can be positive youth camp experience regardless of ideology. However, when there is a position of power over children, there needs to be intense safe guards. 

It wasn't until I wasn't until I was an adult that I learned cult tactics like Love Bombing and public confession. I still question some of my memories with camp. 

I don't know if banning is the correct form, but I would be down for third party oversite. It definitely needs to be looked at regardless of ideology."
AJ_Ak47,"As someone who went to these camps and conferences this is %1000 accurate. Even if it's not sexual abuse the shaming and emotional manipulation is so disgusting. The Church can be a hot bed for some of the worst human beings imaginable. Which is ironic, the only people that ever talked incessantly about sexual predators was the church and yet the only people I've met that ended up being pedophiles and rapists were from the Church. It's despicable how many girls were taken advantage of as teens. The only times the girl didn't get blamed or the only time there wasn't a coverup is when there was too much evidence and the cat was out of the bag (Look up Jack Schaap former pastor of mega church First Baptist Church of Hammond Indiana)"
No_Bonus6336,"Yes, do it! What a fantastic idea! Anything to limit the power those pedophilic monsters have over children!"
,[deleted]
BrainwashedScapegoat,As a victim of church camp abuse I hope this goes through
AbsentThatDay2,Legislative clickbait.  Clearly this is what we should spend our time on.
DGD1411,Good! Fight fire with fire.
IsGoingTTaM,Grooming and then also molesting kids in the name of white Jesus. Bunch of pedophiles.
wizzard4hire,"As much as I dislike religion this reeks of an unconstitutional attack on a civil liberty that will not stand up in court. Religion itself is a hotbed for oppression and abuse of all kinds but when we let  government infringement upon a civil liberty rather than harshly punish offenders, make it easier for civil litigation against the churches, and remove tax exemption for churchs that cover up abuse (all Constitutionally legal by the way), we all lose a little because it begins a stack of dominoes falling. Which liberty will be next because of misuse?"
Marutar,"I'm not into religious indoctrination, but this seems like a clear violation of religious freedoms. None of us should be cheering for the erosion of our rights."
Drone314,"To take a leap of faith, you should at least be 18."
strawberrymacaroni,"It’s wild to me how many people in this sub don’t notice (or care) what a wild violation of the First Amendment this would be, and it would pass exactly 0 legislative bodies.  Not to mention what a turn off it would be to swing voters, moderate voters, and anyone who cares about the constitution.  Just lose lose lose lose.

This is just doing exactly what the right does but being absolutely terrible at it.  Let’s focus on legislation that improves people’s lives and is actually constitutional instead of culture war bullshit."
Richfor3,The world would be a better place if religion didn't exist.
scwizard,"There's no way this is constitutional.

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"
pizoisoned,"It’s weird how the ultimate authority for kids are the parents according these people, unless those parents do things we don’t like. 

I don’t have kids, but I’ve gone to drag story times with a friend and her daughter. The kids had a blast and all seemed thrilled that someone took the time to tell a story with such enthusiasm. I’m not saying it’s for everyone, but it certainly doesn’t teach kids to be angry or mean or afraid."
badhairdad1,The Church is hiding the Groomers
MrFoxManBoy,Fuck yea. We don’t need these groomers assaulting anymore of our kids.
LiberalFartsMajor,"I'm happy to see them fighting crazy with crazy

Also, church is definitely much more dangerous than a drag show."
aleph32,"She proposed the amendment to make a point, but the right-wing media will ignore those subtleties and scream about how ""Democrats want to ban church youth camps!"""
Chemical_Knowledge64,"I agree a lot of these camps go too far and indoctrination should be banned, but what constitutes indoctrination in all seriousness?? 

Is it what’s going on at these camps? Is it merely teaching kids about what is God and about Jesus, Mohammad, Buddha etc considered indoctrination, even if they’re taught in a non dogmatic way? Cause I’m in complete agreement with the former, but not the latter. 

Let people learn about what they wish to learn about at any age, but let them make the decision for themselves about what they wish to follow or not follow, aka religious freedom. I, as a Muslim, am against dogmatism of any kind, both for and against religion. And I know about dogmatism as I have to see and feel the results of the morons that are the Islamic puritans who shout loudly in Islamic lands and online."
SirenSol,"Kids should be with parents. Parents should be with their kids. 

Simple."
AbsentThatDay2,This is going to be top reddit content in the comments I have no doubt.
showmiaface,Religious grooming.
NeedleworkerCrafty17,Hell ya.
TheDruidVandals,good luck with that
alonela,This won’t make it to senate. There’s no way. This is as polarized as the bill for life support on aborted fetuses. No chance.
FatumIustumStultorum,Is there actually a higher instance of child abuse at religious youth camps?
Jayhawk501,Ah shit republicans are about to lose their mind on this one
rnantelle,Grooming.
MustangeRemo,Grooming
hyperiongate,"At first, I thought ""This feels no better than what Republicans are doing,"" then I saw that this is to make a point about what the Republicans are doing."
Banana_Rama_Pajama,Love it. Love this.
mcstank22,I love this.
darexinfinity,This is how you lose your seat in the next election.
RDO_Desmond,"They are not all bad. The problem is churches that disregard and twist the Bible into a book of hate to serve their political agenda. Maybe if more who know the Bible teaches love, faith and hope would speak up more, at least some who hear twisted renditions would recognize they are being misled. Don't want to go down a road of banning this and that."
Muerteds,"The only way we could afford for me or my brother to ever go to camp was for us to go to a Methodist-owned Church Camp.

I got to do camp things, and even found a love of bicycling because of a ""bike camp"" I got to do as part of one summer.

Listen, I know there are shitty Christians, and they piss me off.  But before you just lump all Christian camps together, consider those that allowed us dirt poor kids to do something fun that only rich kids could afford."
GrumpyKaeKae,I live for the pettiness. I'm just so tired at the double standards of the Religious Right when it comes to grooming and ACTUAL child sex abuse.
Kiddo1029,Man this isn’t going to go over well.
OSUTechie,Sen. Lankford may have something to say about this. I mean he did run one of the most largest ~~sex~~ church camp in Oklahoma. And I believe had one of the highest teen pregnancy and std rate in the country
Cuck-In-Chief,They’re not wrong.
NyHardGuy,that's where Grooming begins
ChallyII,If you really care about ending child grooming this is a good step.
Greenman333,I imagine the right’s response to this bill would be something akin to “Bible camp is a constitutionally enumerated right.” Time for Church of Drag!
,[deleted]
Lamont-Cranston,"Something tells me the ""protect the children"" folks wont be rallying around this"
Whiskey_Fiasco,Let’s call these camps what they are: Grooming camps
zonitronic,All churches should be regulated as adult-only entertainment.
efnfen4,They're grooming hotbeds
ArtisanJagon,Call them what they really are - grooming camps.
Only_for_old_reddit,Holy fucking shit that is one of the most unconstitutional things I have ever read.
BEAMeUPScuT,"This thread is depressing to read. 

The United States was founded on the basis of religious freedoms, not freedom from religion. Telling families they can't teach their child a religion because the state forbids it is really concerning.

and ...aren't all youth camps ""hotbeds for child abuse"" in the first place?"
MrDrPr_152,I hope this not only passes but is expanded. Religious targeting of the youth is disgusting.
MackenziePace,Part of me wants to ban all kids in churches because of the dumb drag bills and churches are where kids are actually molested but this is a good step towards progress.
ProfessorTicklebutts,Oh boy I love this.
sunnydaysahead2022,"With how much sexual abuse in churches that has been exposed in the past few years - children shouldn’t be allowed in church at all. 

Church is probably one of the most dangerous places to bring children. Predators love churches. They know they get access to vulnerable people there."
thebadpixel,Churches should be barred from allowing anyone under 18 to enter. They pose a well-documented danger to children.
stashtv,"If you aren't old enough to vote, you're not old enough to choose your religion."
sandysea420,That’s a good start but what about the Church itself!
SaveMyButthole,"I’m all for this. Religion is absolute poison in the world, but I did have my first kiss at Bible camp and my counselor/bunk master whatever dude taught us a really gross parody of *Yesterday*,  called *Leprosy* lol! It was pretty fun for the most part. Just a bunch of kids hiking and canoeing and flirting. 

The church stuff was so minimal and no one but the counselors and preachers took it serious.  Obviously this isn’t what happens at some of these camps but the one I went to was fun."
Jenovas_Witless,"I'm an anti-theist.

I'm very much against religion... but this is fucking wrong. You absolutely should go after all child abusers... but that's not what this is about. This is about attacking religion."
RushSingsOfFreewill,ITT: plenty of progressives happy to ignore the first amendment to own the cons.
Any_Property_7405,you can’t ban religion but you can surely end a 501c3 tax exempt status. Anything else is going to prompt freedom of religion cries.
Boxhead_31,"Call them what they truly are.

Grooming Camps"
UnlawfulDuckling,As a christian i am 100% okay with this. You can teach your beliefs but you cannot hammer them in.
Dismal_Fruit_9208,I support this. Children have no place in church
flufnstuf69,"My god the right wings would start guarding churches with guns daring you to tell them not to take their kids there.

But I agree. While religion and spirituality can be a great way to raise someone with values, if we can’t approach it responsibly we shouldn’t be raising kids there."
PtEthan,I hope they don’t go after Jewish camps. For young Jews who live in areas without many Jews it can be one of the only ways to make Jewish friends. Some Jewish camps are also pretty secular. The camp I went to actually had a lot of non-Jews attend. The religious stuff was pretty much limited to upbeat sing-along style versions of some Jewish prayers and songs for about an hour on Friday night and Saturday morning.
elisakiss,"Don’t forget that the Bible is there.  If we are going to ban books with questionable content, the Bible definitely fits."
Odd-Combination5654,Finally!
MercAlert,Sounds unconstitutional.
t-rags,"I had a lot of fun at church camp. I'm not religious. I made up my own mind despite the ""indoctrination,"" and it was a good character building experience. We went fishing and canoeing. We did group puzzles and learned leadership skills. We had good food and went on hikes.
 Public school is a hotbed for child abuse. The foster system is a hotbed for child abuse. Lots of places can harbor child abuse. Indoctrination can come from any angle and any place. Teaching your children to make up their own mind is a big part of teaching/ training them to be decent, well-rounded adults."
MightyMoonofFrost,"Oh man. When will people realize that polarizing bills like this are not cute. People will be upset. LGBTQIA people are NOT the majority. Keep upsetting the base and people WILL strip down whatever you’ve built over the last few years. The slippery slope is a fallacy, but the beautiful and horrible thing about fallacies is that they have a habit of getting big real fast."
TheManWithTheBigName,"Missouri State Senator proposes blatantly unconstitutional law to make a point. r/politics goes insane thinking that it’s real and based and upvotes it to the moon. 

Reminds me why I stopped posting here in the first place. This will go absolutely nowhere and accomplish nothing. One year from now this bill will be entirely forgotten."
Exodys03,Point taken but let’s stop with proposals to ban anything a certain population finds offensive.  These things have a way of snowballing and rights taken away by the government are rarely returned.
UserofCodename,"It seems like using the legislative process and the tragedy of child abuse  to fuel hate.  Why not target the theater camps, sports camps, boy scouts…as well.  She says it wont pass and she only did it to make a point. That seems irresponsible. There are more cohesive and productive ways to make points.Why contribute when the conspiracies sparking some of these domestic terror incidents often involve the fear that Gov. will take away religious rights. The country is already divided- is she trying to help start a civil war?  This is the type of bias that helped  get Trump elected.   Most Democrats in my area are Jewish and also value religion and religious camps. This just struck me  really wrong. Yet, I’m just a spectator."
bosses_spy_on_you,"are you fucking braindead? the right stirs up the working class on fears that the elite effete liberals are coming for their churches and their guns

doing stupid virtue signalling shit for the PMC like this that has no chance of becoming political reality plays straight into that narrative and harms the left's ability to unite the working class

democrat self own again"
sugarlessdeathbear,"I wouldn't withdraw if it looks like it would pass. Let it pass. Red states are mandating trauma to young kids, so fuck 'em, let them get their shit banned."
