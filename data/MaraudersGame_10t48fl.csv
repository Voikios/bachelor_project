Magiwarriorx,"I swear to Christ, every time I try to kit out, I die to another player. Heavy Stahlhelm, Panzer Rig, STG, plenty of meds? Die to some asshat with a PPSh.

Nothing but the starting Luger? Bunch of dead AI, maybe a player or two, 15k in bonds/jewelry/coins, a BA Flak Vest, and a couple of decent guns.

I just don't get it."
F_O_R_K_S,"This game can sometimes give you the feeling like ""Not EVERY SINGLE PERSON can be better than me, right?""

My friend and I went on a spree where we used the same heavy panzer gear/guns for an entire day of playing, and then the next day lost two full kits in two runs in a row. Just the way these games are."
binturongslop,I wanna love this game but I suck too much to ever want to play it lol.
TheBigZamboni85,"My advice is just shoot the damn gun and bring your best armor. Always bring your best. What I mean is bring a ton of ammo and just fucking shoot. Pre fire everything you feel is sus or know a player is behind. My friend noted I just mag dump and ""waste a lot of ammo."" Like dude most the ammo is cheap af and fuck it if I bring a bar I damn well am gonna shoot it before I die if I get the slightest suspicion someone is holding. I tried to convey the importance of suppressive fire (especially in squads) and fucking half the time the person just peaks mid lag and dies anyway lol. My pvp is average I think at 2.1. Not amazing but not bad. 

Yes I die a shit ton too.

Edit: promise by the 10th time youve lost that plate rig back to back you will stop caring about gear. It comes and goes so freely and once you don't care and start taking risks you'll get better.  Ratting can be profitable but sometime you just gotta stand your ground. It takes just one good shot to change your fortunes so shoot"
InevitableDinner7831,I’ve found I do better as a solo. As far as for looting and quests
SoN1Qz,"In my opinion, playing with a friend makes the game easier. If I get into a firefight and we're both shooting each other down to half HP, I can hide around the corner to heal and my mate will jump in and finish the kill, it's really cool. I'm also less afraid of being loud when playing with a mate.  
On the other hand, sometimes when you see an enemy, you hesitate a little bit before you shoot because you're not sure if it's your mate or not. It all has its pros and cons."
KRS12368,"Heavy psh helm, full panzer armor, stg, and meds, you’ll win most fights, it’s just if they see you first and get some of the first shots in, especially with semi auto guns like the stg, you’re gonna get shit on. I’m not the best but I got like 100 marauder kills. Side note, they should add fucking pants, I’m wearing this 50 pound chest plate and a nylon suit for pants"
Shoresy69420,"git gud 

F1"
Arcanu,"I sucked hard but got better, currently lvl 30. Hang in there."
JohnnyMcMoney,"Yeah, my thoughts for 1500 hrs of Tarkov as well"
Bottledisc,The game is so fun. It's a shame that my matchmaking puts me against top 100 virgins who abuse the L1A1 and kill you in 2 shots.
CircIeJerks,"Be confident, go with at least one other buddy STOP HAVING EVERY GROUP LOCKED and you’ll gets Ws"
HallowzoneOG,"Sometimes I’ll have bad runs. Yesterday I took out 7 marauders in the mines. My advice is to use a healthy balance of slow-paced gameplay and aggression. Don’t be afraid to sprint across a room into a doorway because in this game the peeker has the advantage. You can startle players and have the advantage. At the same time, sometimes you wanna crouch walk and conceal your presence/position. I play solo for the most part and have a 1.88 marauder KD at about 40ish hours."
MediocreCowboi,"the worst feeling is crashing after you extract and you load up to menu and dont have your loot, then the next game crashing again and wouldnt know it it happens again"
