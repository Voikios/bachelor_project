Da_Vader,But wearing a mask was a restriction of their freedom.
MatsThyWit,"If you show up ""improperly dressed"" does the state legislature have to call your mom to bring you more appropriate clothing or do you just get sent home for the day?"
nosotros_road_sodium,"This paragraph really gets it:

> We do applaud the impulse to look more professional in the House. Acting more professional, though, is the real trick. One way to do that: Quit wasting time on the transparently cynical “woke” wars pushed by Gov. DeSantis in his quest for the White House and focus on the real needs of the people. Stuff like affordable housing, a solution to the escalating property-insurance crisis, rising seas, diversifying an economy too dependent on tourism.

Florida, quite literally, is promoting *style* over substance in their legislature!"

TintedApostle,But concealed guns are OK - Amiright
TintedApostle,"The whole goal is to drive women out of political discourse and high school athletics.

The right wing hates Title IX so they instituted the menstrual rule.  Now they are trying to make being a women in politics a burden. 

The GOP and the right wing are a theocratic crazy land."

AbsolutelyNope_,You should look professional.
SaggySackAttack,"Lol can't wear shoes without socks, they probably think it makes you look gay.

You can tell someone over the age of 50/60 thought this up"
iMDirtNapz,This is pretty much standard professional attire dress code. Don’t really see the big issue here.
Twatberriesandcream,Are there restrictions for men? Because if men are required to wear a suit and tie I think it should be no different for women - literally also wearing a suit and tie. However if they’re just pulling rules out their ass for no reason then yeah fuck all of them and let those women skirt.

Walker_ID,"Of all the things to complain about regarding republicans ...I don't think this is one worth the wasted time.

While I'm not a fan of dress codes in general... It's fairly established for the past billion years to have professional standards in terms of dress codes. I would say that any Congressional place of business would qualify as a professional place of business. This is a nothing burger to create faux outrage.  Focus the anger on abortion rights, education, and ethics.... Not a version of something that every white collar job has to put up with."

Such hypocrisy.
There is nothing Christian about any of the nonsense perpetuated by state or federal government."
PrettyPug,Maybe they should consider having women cover their faces too.  That is a novel idea….  What a wonderful regressive society built on greed and power to control others.
Rigo3oh,So at 2 inches every dude gets a boner?

Notsnowbound,"Now, in the interest of fairness, I think that the House should post weekly pictures of all male representatives and staff and let their constituents decide if their attire is appropriate.  Then there should be a public plebiscite on a male dress code for this work.  After all, they are public servants..."
cyaran,"It's a dress code for a professional job. Congressmen have a dress code too. Guess what, so do many other jobs."
Lazy-Infuriated,"Is that a typo? Surely they meant ""ankle"" and ""an inch below""???"
seen_enough_hentai,"Feverishly hoping there’s a male rep with a dad bod and a shred of decency left, who’ll come rocking into session on a sleeveless blouse and skorts. And dress shoes, cause ain’t no guy who wants to fuck w/heels."
DamnAcorns,I mean let’s be honest this is more restrictive for men than women. Men have to even wear socks. So is the argument that we should do away with dress codes completely? Because I’m not sure that’s the best idea either. You know some Q fan would be rocking a conspiracy t-shirt.
slacker346,"Regardless of gender, everyone should be wearing business attire.  The end.  Specifying skirt length is redundant."
Interesting-Month-56,Do the men get to wear shorts?
Zeronaut81,"Conservative men have shown themselves incapable of controlling their urges around women, and don’t value women except as brood mares. Conservative men don’t care to honor a woman’s bodily autonomy, don’t care if they die during childbirth, don’t care if they’re raped. Rules like this are a *clear warning* to women to be careful around these assholes. The men they will work with are clearly little boys who can’t control their pee pees, and feel entitled to have their way with any woman who dares arouse them."
homerteedo,"It’s a dumb rule, but it’s crazy how many people think a pretty normal dress code for business is the next step to Gilead."
timewasterapp,It’s called dressing professional. Lol
KR1735,"This is basically the dress code we had as doctors pre-COVID. Except for instead of a jacket or suit coat, we wore white coats (some would omit it but we weren’t supposed to). Men wore a shirt and tie, women wore a skirt or something like a pantsuit. 

As a man, I always envied the women and their option to wear a skirt. I’d have loved to have worn shorts on a 100° day, rather than be stuck wearing long pants. 

Seems like a pretty standard workplace dress code here. Of course, given who’s implementing it, it raises eyebrows. Seems like a pattern. But by itself it’s not a huge deal."
lex99,"What I don’t understand: are people here really saying mini-skirts are appropriate for representatives?  Maybe also super low-cut top with lots of breast on display?  Maybe the men should also roll in in t-shirts and flip-flops, or unbuttoned dress shirt with chest hair on full view?"
taintelmosfire,Can men wear shorts?  Serious question.  I have no problem with dress codes as long as they are applied equally.
AndStillShePersisted,When future historians review the past 5 years they’re going to be so confused how we slid backwards so fast…
BabyMFBear,"Unpopular opinion:

I consider myself pretty lax about office dress codes. I often bend the rules and get away with it, and I work in federal government.

With that said, our dress code here is not suit and tie for men - it used to be. I would hate that.

However, the acceptable dress code for men in elected positions is suit and tie, even if someone like Gym Jordan refuses to wear the jacket, which he has been called out on.

If there is a standard for men, there should be a standard for women. If something as restrictive as a suit and tie is required for men, then something equally restrictive should apply to women.

Why should there be a difference?

While I’m going to get downvotes anyway, a man who chooses to wear a dress should be allowed to and should adhere to the one-inch-above-the-knee policy as well."
redvillafranco,I wonder what happens if you break the dress code. Will security physically prevent you from entering the chamber to vote? Or is it a verbal reprimand? Stripped of committee assignments? What happens?
S0_Crates,"I just want to know when it will become ok for guys to wear shorts the same way women can wear skirts.

Find some styles that fit the criteria of no shoulders visible, length, etc and wear those instead.

All the talk of ""slippery slopes"" when it comes to gun laws, but no talk of it when it comes to restricting clothing for women.

Captain_SpaceRaptor,"I went to Catholic school.  They would take two fingers and place them above your knee.  If the skirt/dress was higher than that detention.  The male teachers loved doing this.  

Guys had no such dress code.  The responsibility of morality essentially fell on to the young ladies.  It's a stupid and outdated way of thinking.  Just forcing people to comply with rules that don't affect anything but their need for control over others. Even over the most mundane things."

errdayimshuffln,"As a Muslim, I approve. Thank you for passing Sharia law.

Conservatives made such a hullabaloo against Sharia law, I never thought they'd full on start adopting it. So it must have been jealousy all along?

CrossdressTimelady,"That's stupid that adults need a dress code.  They should know how to dress professionally!  I disagree with TELLING people what to do or mandating anything, but I don't think a skirt right above the knees is some kind of insanely modest thing that's right out of Gilead or the Taliban or whatever.  I haven't wanted to wear ultra short skirts since I had a 26"" waist.  Personal preference.  But I don't see how any mature woman would be comfortable wearing a mini skirt in a professional setting, especially with something like 2/3 of Americans being fat."

Confirmed_Retapaded,Having a dress code = literally 1984
shadowmaker000,"I used to work for a company with a business professional dress code. Suit & tie, every day, no exceptions. After a year of being there, younger new hires started wearing sweat pants, PJs, hoodies, hats, shorts to work. At some point the company gave up on enforcing its dress code except on presentations and just about everyone wore whatever. The one thing I noticed was the change in demeanor. In suits, we all just got along and acted like professionals. Showed up on time, cared about the work and such. At the end it felt unruly. People were showing up late, slacked off, talked back to management, didn’t get along well, goofed off, didn’t care. And it was everyone who used to be great became a dick. I left that company for something more professionally minded but not too strict since it is nice to wear comfortable clothing but not to a point where that company looked like kids on a playground."

Wasteland_Mystic,How long before Republicans require women to not show their hair nor be allowed to hold political office?
Interesting-Month-56,"IMHO, dress codes should be unisex. And should also fall on the side of being more liberal than restrictive. The reality is that dress codes in general are specifically in place to reinforce religiously inspired social/gender norms. 

If we want real equality, then everyone should wear the same uniform for various jobs, including government. 

There is no reason that women's suits need to include revealing tops and skirts, unless men get to wear the same. Most women's suits are designed to play to sexual cues, which degrades the women (apparently they cannot compete in business without resorting to selling sex?) and perpetuates assumptions by men in power that women are valuable for their sexuality, and not just their skills."

UtopianLibrary,"This was my middle school dress code, and, even back then, it was misogynistic and complete BS as a way to control women’s decisions. 

Mrs. Patterson, if you’re reading this, the day you chased me across the cafeteria when I was in sixth grade (ten years ago) because my skirt was half an inch too short was not because you cared about me. You wanted to exert your power as an assistant principal. At the time, my father was laid off and we couldn’t afford new clothes. I grew out of the skirt. That’s why it was least half an inch too short. You didn’t need to embarrass me in front of the entire sixth grade. 

Now that I work in education, I do not enforce the dress code because of this moment."

Conrodbob,Forcing women to wear their skirts no more than an inch above the knee is no different than forcing them into Burkas.  It is a purely sexist rule.  A dress code aimed at women has only to do with men’s inability to control their thoughts and lecherous feelings
