JoakimSpinglefarb,"Turn off VSYNC and cap at 60 because otherwise that next door will never open.

FTFY."
Thanatos-,I remember forcing Triple Buffered V-Sync fixed my problems up until the turret section.
AngryRinger,I‚Äôm more hyped up to see how the nursery rhyme trailer is done. It‚Äôs a Dead Space tradition.
AlcatorSK,"Ah, Dead Space... So many memories...

Plain_Tart,"Should I play dead space? I‚Äôve never played a horror game and idk if I‚Äôll like it. It‚Äôs on gamepass but I get scared super easily (Ik ik I‚Äôm a bitch whatever), is it THAT scary or is it just intense?"
HFAARP,nothing you say will ever convince me to suffer screen tearing
littlebloke,In space no one can Vsync Screens
Deijya,I‚Äôm more worried about the new power cycling mechanic. Imagine turning off the oxygen in the next area and the ai generator doesn‚Äôt spawn an o2 tank.
DamnImAwesome,My biggest fear is they only made this game as a FU to the Callisto Protocol devs. I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs gonna be barebones just to milk some cash. I hope I‚Äôm wrong because Dead Space was amazing
psyferion,"Can someone fill me in on VSYNC in general? I never understood the purpose of it and get mad that it's even an option in video games because I always end up turning it off or I will have terrible graphical problems. I now imagine this is the majority of what others do as well and not just me over the years, so why the hell do developers keep giving people the option to turn on VSYNC or having it on by default, knowing its going to break a lot of peoples experience of the game they just created and need good reviews to increase sales."
InsydeOwt,spase so fast you fard and shid pant
LeonTheSpartan,Wait for reviews please. This will lead to more efford in gaming development
UnityAeDeSt,"Heard this was recommended, as it could ruin the entire game system somehow. For me, I HAD to put on VSync. Without it my game had an awful thing that had my mouse unable to move the camera properly, requiring me to drag the mouse a bunch of times to even aim/look around properly. Turning it on fixed the mouse and then my game ran smoothly.

I had survived on my first playthrough on the hardest difficulty with this camera problem. I was genuinelly afraid that I‚Äôd die any moment. And there was not enough ammo to spare, which put me in situations where I needed to make a run for it. It felt like a real situation for me to deal with of survival.

I loved it AND hated every second of it. :)"
UnholyHunger,CUT OFF THEIR FPS!
EpicForgetfulness,"When is the remake coming out? I forgot they were doing this. I saw the vids a while back and it looks way better than I ever thought it could. The graphics were already way ahead of other games from its time.

Also wtf is Vsync? I didn't even know this game was on PC when I played. I played on Xbox."
asyrin25,"""Hey Boss, I was going to fund a workaround for that glitch that trapped players with vsync on just like you asked, but I'm going to be honest here. I spent the entire week browsing Reddit. No, wait. Don't be mad. I have a crazy idea. Call the art department and just hear me out..."""
zachtheperson,"Idk, I was super excited for this remake, but it looks like they're removing a lot of subtlety and making it more extravagant in the vein of Dead Space 2. 

More spectical with lighting effects where they take away camera control, Isaac speaking more in ways that doesn't actually contribute to the story, making everything shiny to show off improved graphics, and a bunch of jetpack missions. 

Not saying that's bad for a game, but almost all of those detract from the tone of the original Dead Space."
Nekrozys,"I hope they fix the problem with this part of the game where the bloody message tells you to dismember them, then an audiolog tells you to dismember them, then the crew tells you multiple time to dismember them.

Once or twice is enough. More than that and you're making me feel like a child who can't follow simple instructions."
Berserkware,Does vsync to anything other than limiting your FPS to the screen refresh rate?
nocidex,I really like the band N-Sync
OuttaPhaze,The door will open you just can't go through.
nenni_docet,"Can someone explain, please? I never played dead space"
Senliast,Oh it's such a nostalgia
cupris_anax,The in game v-sync and framerate cap settings are not always accurate. Turn them both off and enable v-sync through your graphics card settings instead.
Butch_Meat_Hook,'Schofield Tools'
Cookldog,Have you guys seen the remake for the game right now it looks way to bright that won‚Äôt work to make the game scary
GabagoolsNGhosts,"So pumped to download this, shut the lights off, and get scared as f\*ck again."
DoctorMedical,I really wish they made a new addition to the series instead of remaking the first.
ApplicationCalm649,That made me lol. Thanks. I needed that.
ZippZappBippBapp,"As an aspiring game dev with some serious love for the Dead Space trilogy (I‚Äôm willing to throw a bone to the third game, but that‚Äôs another story for another discussion), I‚Äôm really pumped for this game. Dead Space taught me how to be scared shitless, and wanna keep being scared shitless.

I forget the exact quote, and who said it, but something along the lines of ‚ÄúI hated scary games because they were scary. Now, I know how to make scary games.‚Äù This rings so true for me, and my love for horror and sci-fi is just a loving concoction for this game.

I hope it‚Äôs a love letter and not a cash-grab; of all games, this game deserves some love!"
StarkSpider24,That‚Äôs hilarious (especially after reading other comments on what it means üòÜ)
THEMACGOD,Everything about the remake looks great... except his helmet.
Wisdomseekr79,What‚Äôs wrong with V Sync?
J4k1415,Never played Dead Space. Really want to but feel like I gotta wait for the remake üò©
guitarist4hire,"fuck you, my PC.

make your game run better, maybe?"
