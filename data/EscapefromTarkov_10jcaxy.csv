PanProjektor,What a sweet sweet stock AK recoil ü•≤
chairforce,"I miss being able to have extended battles with AI Boss and Boss Guard AI where they did not immediately head/eyes aimbot you from half a football field away through bushes. Then while you're in the middle of looting all the good loot they used to have another team or two would roll up to check out what happened and you'd have to fight it out with them. 

The combat was so much more exhilarating when you had something to fight for. Now people load into customs, loot some safes and are out before the halfway mark of the raid because it's less cost effective to stay in and fight."
lordisgaea,"The shotgun recoil comparison made me cry. Camera recoil is just so stupidly broken it doesn't make any sense.

Also this points to something that is unfortunate about the game, it's that a lot of features just aren't working as intended in the first place. That is why I'm am not too hopeful about this video having much impact on Tarkov's development as the problems that the game suffers from are not just from bad decisions but also from BSG being incompetent."
4507862401892,"Veritas makes a lot of good points in this video, and  I encourage everyone to give it a look. We‚Äôre all here because we fell in love with Tarkov in one way or another. Giving attention to those who genuinely wants to see the game heading in a better direction is important"
Nick240z,You know things are in bad shape when Veritas makes a video and 99% of people agree with it.
Epicloa,"Full agree with so much of this video so far, I genuinely don't understand how anyone who has ever shot a gun thinks the recoil in Tarkov is ""realistic"". And if I can get a stamina boost playing airsoft then I can only imagine what actual gunfire must ignite in a trained soldier."
Bap1811,"Not finished yet, but this point is something I've been thinking about for a while since I played a bunch of MWII when it came out.


The gunplay in Modern Warfare II is overall just significantly more realistic or ""authentic"" than Tarkov, which I think is humerous all things considered. It feels like we've gone full circle. Maybe tarkov just needs to drop the ""realistic"" tagline that seems attached to it at this point, it feels like a deficit."
SOVERElGN_SC,Question is if Nikita or somebody responsible at BSG will watch this great video and take efforts to make the game better. With lack of communication we can‚Äôt be sure even if they understand the problems.
Interceptor21,"This Video perfectly describes my feelings about the game currently. Every Kill I get, with a gun that is not a laser beam, feels like the most random Spray and pray, where I just hope for that sweet, sweet ""head eyes."" Like a Silver player in CSGO that buys a P90 every round to run and gun with."
irze,"For me, gaming is about fun and enjoyment, and in my opinion, the game was more fun in 2020 for example.

It still felt hardcore then. You‚Äôd still spend a million roubles on a loadout and lose it 5 minutes into a raid, you‚Äôd still spend half an hour looting to get one-tapped out of nowhere. But at least it felt like YOU, the player, had more control over your PMC and what happened to him. Now we have uncontrollable recoil and a movement/weight system that punishes you for running more than a pistol and a scav vest.

Yes, AD spamming was a bit over the top and laserbeam M4s/HKs were ridiculously good, but would I go back to that point in time? Absolutely. Instead of just tuning these systems they absolutely butchered them. I really think finding a happy medium between these two states would make the combat infinitely more enjoyable than it is now."
SirKillsalot,"Agree: Weapon handling, covert movement and mobility. 

Disagree: Armour effectiveness. After all the recent ammo changes, armor is in a good spot imo. I've been saved by my helmet more times in the last 5 raids than possibly all of last wipe."
whatsgoingontho,"I agree on basically everything and more.  Tarkov is literally he best fps game ever and in its prime was in a place no other game could touch.  They just overtune everything so poorly.  Need inertia? Yes.  Here's inertia that makes your character feel like hes on ice skates that you cant control.  Need to somehow fix all the 0 recoil laser beam weapons? Yes. Here's recoil that makes no sense at all and makes it seem like you are an 8 year old shooting their first full auto. Need some sort of stamina system? Yep.  Now you can run 50ft and need to stand still and not move.  Because if you crouch down you lose half your bar when you stand up.


Just dial everything back like 60%, and make it so moving slowly doesn't make sounds to people 80 yards away.  Why does me slow walking sound like I'm directly next to them?  Playing slowly just doesn't exist anymore."
N1LEredd,And they called me crazy when I suggested that warzone has more realistic movements than tarkov right now.
AIpacaman,"I agree with the video. Tarkov is currently my most played game still but a lot of the mechanics in the game don't feel hardcore or realistic, just tedious and annoying.

Horizontal recoil makes it feel like I have no control over my weapon, scopes are ass because the PiP reduces my FPS and then also makes it so you cant see anything when you fire, spawns are crap in lots of maps and getting shot once by someone checking your spawn direction means you are instantly unable to sprint and just die.

Also the armor not protecting enough definitely feels true. I'm just going to get tapped anyway so might as well just sell this cool T6 armor I found and buy a bunch of ratrigs to protect me against scavs.

And definitely sad to see that you used to have some ways to sneak with less ads and movement noise. That's the reason we see rats and chads nowadays. You either Shift+W and just ""outgame"" people and potentially even confuse them because binaural doesn't work, making them look the other way. Or what most new players do is **stand completely still and do nothing** because everything you do makes noise and gives you away.

Implementing changes to make the game like the raid series would make tarkov more fun, immersive and because of less RNG things more skillful too even though some might consider these changes ""making the game easier""."
Individual_Draft5089,With a years work I think they could make the perfect tarkov in the cod engine lol.
Jocrystals,PLZ BSG Help
Berenjenacion,Graet analysis. Hope BSG can watch this.
leeverpool,"When one tells people throwing cod as a bad example of fps mechanics is absolute degeneracy, while giving examples as to why that is so, they get downvoted to oblivion and called casual loser scrubs. Which is pathetic to say the least.

Veritas perfectly sums this all up and throws a middle finger to that crowd. In addition, he expresses exactly how people that care about the game without becoming deluded fanboys, think and process the current state of tarkov.

Unfortunately I don't think this game is ever going to get any better. And I do feel that if this is the direction this game is going, sooner rather than later, it won't have that many legs either."
Road_Beginning,"This is a GREAT analysis. I‚Äôve been playing for 4 wipes, for 3 of them I suffered w a shit rig getting 15-30fps and invested 2k hours in because of the gameplay and experience. I truly love this game, and want to see it improve. 

Went and bought a new rig mainly for this game for this wipe, but I‚Äôm left feeling the gunplay just feels unsatisfying, and an exercise in frustration. 

Like you know you hit a problem when the only way to keep on target and not lose sight and decrease RNG is point fire. Which is the exact OPPOSITE of realism. My fear is they‚Äôll just nerf that next.  Which will cause the game to just feel like you‚Äôre a pmc who‚Äôs weak AND blind.

Combat just feels not good currently, and you neither feel great about winning either. It‚Äôs like well, RNG said I won this one."
rinkydinkis,This video just makes me wanna buy cod
Alexxfernandes61,"Unpleasant truth, movement in cod is more realistic than movement in Tarkov"
dodgyeduck,"Great video and clearly shows where the game has gone wrong with recoil. 

The movement though is tough due to the amount of latency in this game. Slower players are less likely to desync kill you, while fast moving players will cause situations of ‚Äúhow did i die i didn‚Äôt see him‚Äù happening was more often than it currently does. 

If latency is addressed then moving back to faster paced movement would be nice but currently the slow movement is a band aid for the high latency."
rtaSmash,"I hope someone at BSG watches this and gets into thinking. Things really need to change. The gameplay feels so punishing and arbitrarily ""hard"". It's like a chore instead of what it used to be. The game doesnt have to be fun as in Nikitas words he doesntt want a fun game. But we are not going into the realism area either, so what direction are we going? We are punishing players in so many aspects of gameplay loop and even outside of it just for the sake of doing so."
Cydocore,"I wish Veritas also touched on the WASD circling bullshit we have to do now to peak around corners in hopes of not getting our heads blown off. There are other things that are needlessly slow in Tarkov that nobody comments on. As an example, look at how long it takes to pull out a grenade, check your mag, etc. I agree that grenades are in a much better spot than they were before, where you could chuck 5 of them in a row out of your ass, but currently literally every move you make in Tarkov feels like you're doing it at the bottom of the ocean."
piotreza,"I've played the game for about 5-6 Years and i agree with almaost every points but some. 

First is armor wich in my opinion is in an interesting place right now with how they tried to balance ammo (less high tier armor and high tier ammo, buff to common ammo like 855/ps against tier 3 armor). I want to see more of what BSG want to do on that. Cherry picking clips where he get headshotted feel cheap to backup his argument.

Second is stamina, but i agree half with it. Losing stamina when you get shot feels terrible and i agree fully with him, however i feel like BSG treat sprinting like ""full sprinting"", and the entire argument that soldier can indeed run 12miles without being exhausted hold if you account that they are in fact not sprinting but jogging, wich is exactly what our pmc do when they are ""walking"" at full speed. I truly want bsg to increase the base movement speed so sprinting actually feel like a faster and combat repositioning tool. Add combat stance where you walk slower but your gun is up and ready. In fact just like what we see in the raids video.

Tone down inertia, and adjust it because it does feel terrible as well, and i've got no hope for nikita to change recoil anytime soon...

Apart from those two, he's right on the needle."
Gunaks,"After 5 wipes I think I'm done being excited for this game. I feel like since the December 2021 wipe, this game has started to go down in a blazing wreck.

First 2 wipes: fun and challenging figuring out things, no kappa.

Wipe 3 (Dec 2021): Wow this recoil change is garbage. Inertia is cool, I can get used to this but I hate recoil. Kappa

Wipe 4: Wow we still have this garbage recoil AND the servers are complete garbage. I guess I can get used to this... kappa

This wipe: Wow we still have garbage recoil, shit servers, and now an audio system that doesn't work. I have hit level 40 and both my friends and I have lost interest in pushing for kappa this wipe.

Every wipe so far has added problems and fixed none, and have now compounded into something I no longer want to play."
AllYouNeedIsLove69,I cant be happy about a kill when i know i killed the dude only because i know how to abuse desync or when i die because of desync. That is 90 procent of fights...
zebrakats,"The game used to be so much more fun around the 12.0 era, when Shroud and all the big streamers were playing it a lot. Before they added the weight system and inertia. It had its issues back then but at least I was having fun. It seems like every patch they make the game more frustrating to play.

They just go overboard with the changes in my opinion. Inertia was needed but it feels like I have no control over my character. Weight system is a good idea but I‚Äôm overweight with a starting load out. They don‚Äôt seem to know how to take a light touch approach, and they overcorrect way too far."
Cydocore,"There, the man said it all. This is EXACTLY how I feel about Tarkov today."
Robbeeeen,"This video could've been 5 hours long if you wanted to list everything needlessly, easily fixable wrong with the game.

Does it really add anything to the game that you **NEED** a wiki page to know what armor has which penetration level or damage? Or what Armor level even is? Would it be so difficult to shuffle around quests once in a while so we don't have to spam Shoreline 50 raids in a row every wipe? Can we ever get a map released that runs at more than 50 FPS for 2 years before it gets slowly optimized? Can we get RMT/Cheater changes that actually combat cheaters and RMT, rather than fucking over the rest of the community but doing nothing to hinder cheaters? I for one liked that Labs was the go-to cheater map back in the day and I didn't see them anywhere else. The list goes on endlessly

At this point sadly the only thing to hope for is that some studio takes COD MW2 gunplay and movement and fuses it with the Tarkov gameplay loop (especially out-of-raid), map design and immersion."
i_skin_squirrels,"I recently watched some 0.7/0.8 gameplay, and it was so much fun. Right now they removed all the incentive to pvp and made the game all about looting loose loot, the dream game of any rat. Boring if you ask me."
quiz_knows,"Bro, I just want guns to be playable off the shelf. A stock AKM puts my camera on the moon."
Stasiaj,"I couldn't agree more with this vid, it's on point in every regard."
Lonely_Scylla,"Shooting is easily the worst part about Tarkov. 0.13 shjows how much BSG forgot the ""tactical shooter"" part of the game : new map, new content (LightKeeper) but no changes on recoil, armor, penetration, scopes ..."
pca03,"While I agree with the recoil and arms tiring points, I would argue his take on armor (22:06) is irrelevant by not showing were on the body the kill shots were. I don't believe he has a faceshield in any of the clips. So for all we know he could have been Head/Eyes, Jaws, Ears, etc in every clip. Not saying his statement on armor is incorrect, but the clips really do not provide any support to his claim. Especially the first clip where we can see the first shot blacked his head and arm, which assuming he had a helmet on, almost disproves his point since the first shot DID NOT kill him."
InertiaEnjoyer,The community relentlessly complained about the movement being too fast and recoil-less laser beams for years and now here we are wanting it all back. It's a weird circle. I think a 30% reduction in weight effects and base recoil would go a long way with finding a good middle ground.
70monocle,The patch that added interchange was the most fun I have had in the game. In my opinion the game has been taking a step back with every step forward since adding the flea market
myslead,"biggest perpetrator is definitely the recoil this wipe, I can omit basically everything else, but I want to enjoy shooting"
Lowosero,nikita should watch!
_THORONGIL_,"All of his points could be fixed by simple number tweaking.

Reduce X system by 50%, this one by 30% and you have a good game."
ImNewHereAmigo,"I think what Tarkov needs is a run speed between full bore sprint and walk.  On the topic of long distance movements.  I have done a 12 mile ruck sub 2 hours, so I feel a little qualified.  That being said, when we would tackle these it would be with what my buddies and I call a shuffle run.  However, if the sprint we are currently using is ALL OUT, they should increase the speed and keep the stamina drain the same-ish.  Sprinting in full kit is brutal.  Standing up from a knee also does not need to take away 25% of your stamina.  When I was at a large culminating exercise our rucks were 130 lbs, we had to go into short halt postures multiple times and it was horrible, and getting up sucked, but it did not crush any of us the way it crushes our PMCs on here."
quadilioso,"they‚Äôll never fix it. Anybody who has paid attention to any of their major ‚Äúoverhauls‚Äù can attest that anything they‚Äôve ever implemented, like optics, will get a half assed attempt at best. The fuckin optics overhaul was a joke. FiR status is a universal bandaid for a bunch of different problems, some of which don‚Äôt even exist or are solved by other changes. Flea market was temporary. Maps getting ruined by expansions. Old map areas or mechanics never getting a second glance once they were put in. We are stuck with what we‚Äôve got and whatever they half ass."
Ivandragosgopnikson,Quite the situation when the new COD has better and more realistic gunplay than EFT. Tarkov getting popular and attracting all these loud milsim shitters was the death of it. Most of them probably don't even play anymore after all the dumbass changes they asked for.
Griffith_Skywalker,Nikita look at this videos please lmao
gudzgudz,"Holyy, I don't normally like Veritas's content.. he takes too long to get his points across, and i'm afraid Nikita will not watch it..... but the points he made here are sooo SPOT ON. Old tarkov combat seems so much more enjoyable, what a GAME should be ... and why I think PUBG's less realistic and longer lasting fights are more enjoyable.

\- high TTK / bullet-sponginess a) raises skill and reduces RNG factor b) mitigates desync/peeker advantage c) makes it worth investing in more expensive armors/helmets... right now it feels like  90% fights end in 0.1second, regardless of armor class.

\- adrenaline rush. Currently it's an absolute must to be pre-med'd, otherwise you automatically die if shot anywhere basically.. helpless, limping, out of stamina. IRL you'd run for your life, not feeling the pain. Then it would be up to the shooter's tracking/aim skill to finish off the pray.

\- blindfire. I hadn't even realised this - blindfire could be used while moving and was actually a valid strategy, punishing people holding an angle being out of position. Not anymore. Now it's as useful as smoke grenades...

\- Stamina, movement, weight system. I think we all agree here, it is super overtuned right now. Overweight at the start of every raid.. while wearing light armors. Unrewarding killing players as gear is just too heavy to loot. Using all my stamina just to repeatedly fail to jump over 20cm obstacles.... so bad. Lighthouse mountain climbing is just.. so.. janky.

\- Recoil. The clip of him spraying and hitting the head and admitting it's not skill, just luck is perfect. It feels this is what most fights come down too... ""spraying and praying"". Praying that my recoil kick will result in me hitting an enemy's head some milliseconds faster than vice versa.

Overall, Tarkov has become OVERCOMPLICATED and BLOATED, RNG & desync-based 0.1s lasting combat, raid preparation simulator. It doesn't feel ""hardcore"", it just feels BAD."
Nesuma,"I only play every few wipes, never much longer than lvl 40 and thought I kept up to date with minor changes. I absolutely did not realize how many things became worse, as there were always enough interesting new things to enjoy. I didn't even remember there was a time after the face hitbox was added but healing animations did not exist. While I definitely like healing animations I think it's ridiculous that almost any hit instantly makes you heavy bleed and slow walk, forcing you to die few moments later or apply multiple meds (and therefore die). Especially if a leg is ""gone""."
Synchrotr0n,"Can't argue about how good or bad the game was in the past since I only started playing this wipe (I've been following a long time though), however from my general experience with Path of Exile which is another game that updates frequently, a new patch can easily be a downgrade even though the general direction is improving over the course of multiple patches, which is when things like desync, bugged audio and other major issues come in play in Tarkov (especially when the devs have barely fixed anything a month into the wipe).

Moreover, for a game that wants to be hardcore and have at least a semi realistic gameplay, there are things that simply make me dumbfounded. One example is the huge amount of recoil with weapons, which not only is unrealistic but also completely illogical from a gameplay perspective, because it promotes hipfiring with laser pointers even at distances that would be far beyond what is considered a close quarter battle. Another example are the ""bat ears"" that players have, a thing that existed before the current issue with bugged audio and makes the sound not only feel unrealistic, with players being able to hear someone moving slowly even in smooth terrain, but also makes the game nearly unplayable if you're trying to play as a rat due to you not being very good at the game or having started playing late into the wipe, since it's nearly impossible to remain stealth while slowly looting or completing missions."
lincon127,"This is why SPTarkov is so valuable, you really get to modify it to how you believe the game should be. Sure you miss out real player interactions, but honestly you can make the game *fun* with all the mods out there. The realism mod completely reworks armor and makes armor matter significantly more, everything in that mod is also tweakable and toggleable. Paired alongside a few other mods and you can make the game feel almost exactly as Veritas explains his ideal version of Tarkov to be."
Apart-Volume9340,The most fun I ever had watching and playing this game was when people were shoving 100 backpacks into one and running around like superman blowing heads off with vals and hks.
,"1000% agree. i dont think theres a single thing i can disagree here.

i dont understand how anyone can defend the direction the game is taking, even if they think its ""realistic"", which it simply isnt."
Riddlein95,The recoil on the weapons are laughably exaggerated. You talk to anyone who has shot these weapons and they will say the same thing. It‚Äôs only fatboy keyboard operators who larp with airsoft gear who tell you to get good at this game in that context lol
thed0pepope,"Thanks to Veritas for the blast from the past. I think it captures the essence of what used to be so fun in this game, and I agree with most of it. I do like the healing animations though and think being able to run and heal is bullshit. Armor used to protect you more, not sure if I'd prefer the old armor or this one, but he's right about bringing in incredibly rare stuff doesn't really feel worth it like it used to.

The mobility and gunplay that old tarkov offered was incredibly fun, exciting and offered ways to outplay opponents that simply aren't possible in todays tarkov, it promoted skill in the game much more than it does now. I used to think Tarkov had the best feeling movement in any shooter, it's not even close now, atleast in my opinion.

Kills with nades was way more common when you could just keep a nade or two in your secure container if needed and then put em in your rig and throw them out without first having to take them into your hands. Grenadier task used to be automatically completed more or less over time, now atleast for me I have to actually force it and the recent wipes I played it's been painful.

I didn't play the last wipe before this one, and very early this wipe I decided that this will be my last, as long as the current state of the game does not change by a lot for the better. I didn't really know why the game used to feel so much more exciting and fun to put time into until I saw this video."
waysofthespoon,"A very central idea on what tarkov is currently lacking for many of us is AGENCY. The limiting factors are consistently tearing us out of immersion and instead of focusing on how to fight against others and experiencing the clusterfuck chess match that is single life shooters, most of us get caught up in the various negative statuses. 

Weight, inertia, noise, aimbot AI, stims, SKILLS. At the end of the day, hardcore is not ""annoying."" It is a constant application of our knowledge and skills that - if not correctly applied - can cause negative outcomes. I believe the team at BSG has been caught up by the whirlwind of discussion and opinion that is the community, and for the past few years have been focused on implementing systems they've wanted in the game as ways to NERF aspects of gameplay, rather than implementation geared towards depth of gameplay.

Weight and inertia are perfect examples of this. I don't think anyone TRULY believes they don't want these systems. Most people would just rather feel complete agency in their actions than the current tuning of systems. This wipe I've had (too much) time to grind out, and I just hit lvl 40. I have level 24 strength, but because of the overturned weight system, I am only at SIX endurance. Since my first raids I was constantly ""overweight,"" but I'm pretty sure that's the norm for most people. Most players won't even go past 24 strength, and yet I'm sure these changes were implemented as they are to slow down progression and to try to please a player base that felt as though the strafing, bunny-hopping fps gremlins had too strong of an advantage.

We got what we wanted, but the problem isn't gone. Metas shifted, strafing turned into pixel peaking and jiggle peaking, and people learned to fear desync even more. In a video game sandbox environment, people will learn to take advantage of every strategy available to win, no matter how ridiculous. When you overtune your gameplay to such an extent to try and restrict movement and gunplay, people will inevitably find new systems to gain an advantage, whether intentional or not. The problem isn't people using these systems, it is both the lack of agency given to each person in a firefight and the sheer quantity of ridiculous variables each person must pay attention to in order to overcome a fight. Imagine a tarkov where more players felt enabled to engage in gunfights, where the types of tactics you employed each required different responses, and you had the tools to do so.

With all of the systems so interconnected, it can feel impossible currently to engage with players because your footsteps are heard from a mile away, and when you get shot; you lose all stamina. And your gun is only viable from under 30m. When the D2 and customs expansions were fresh, people said they wanted to stop getting strafed and lasered from across hallways, but when your gun turns 90¬∞ every time you get somewhat close to cover, and every motion you make creates a LOUD, DISTINCT sound; the people playing carefully were playing right into their opponents hands. You can listen to each sound, toss a nade, run through that hall, and then strafe out and spray the corner exactly where you heard that person.

Now, we suffer from the overflow of conditions. It feels frustrating rather than empowering. But that is not because those systems exist. It is because they currently overpower your agency to act. Most new players suffer not because of lack of fps experience, but because they fail to decipher what systems they should be engaging with in a moment. Unfortunately, the best strategy to win has always been either to get that instant kill from being completely unnoticed, or overloading your opponent and overloading their options by rushing and disorienting them. But this can be part of the fun as well. What I'd suggest is empowering each player to engage in each system they find, rather than consistently punish them for it.

An increase in stamina, metabolism, and weight limit along with a decrease in inertia could allow for this. But I also believe most skills would do well by being buffed significantly at their base levels. You WILL die in tarkov, this is known. But what if you could also do more again? We have all the current systems in the game for that survival aspect, but tarkov really is a looter shooter as it currently stands. Why not increase competition by allowing players a level of comfort, but ask them to push themselves in order to progress towards new and exciting play styles and items? The new rare tech loot in the labs is exciting at first, but once you realize that past hideout upgrades it only grants you trades for thermals, it feels sort of underwhelming. 

People will have better gear than you, but that's a core aspect of the game. Rather than most things being annoying to use, the sandbox should allow for a MW2-lite level of usage for each item. That thermal you grabbed SHOULD be fucking amazing. The slick you found in a crate and the MK-18 should both help you dominate other players. But the vectors or ump should allow for quick placement of shots on just about ANYTHING in front of you. That 300k ruble HK SHOULD shred people, because it cost you a whole raid of good gameplay to purchase all those parts. But instead of just nerfing the whole movement system to reduce the play style, maybe add new sprint to fire penalties and hip fire penalties for super long and heavy guns. But make it a trade off. It's always been all the best things or nothing with tarkov. But I feel as though in order for tarkov to feel invigorating, you must allow players to always find a strength in their character and items. I'd rather be excited to win a fight and use crazy shit that's not super common than be completely underwhelmed by everything.

One final note that may upset some of you. This community is toxic. It has always been toxic. Tarkov is a game with so many variables that it can be hard to pinpoint what is frustrating you. Instead of asking for more opportunities, we always ask for LESS. Less movement, less cheaters, less gear, remove ammo, remove good recoil attachments, ""remove your life kiddo."" The reason bsg does not communicate with their community as much as you'd like us because people are always looking to shit on every new introduction instantly and then beg for the old days as though we weren't doing the same thing back then. Whether you'd like to admit it or not, the folks over at bsg actually LISTEN and RESPOND much more than most dev companies. If we want to see positive change, we must start asking for MORE, not less. And maybe if the discussion brought ideas to the table instead of insults, you'd see less reactionary introductions to the game than we currently see.

Anyways, my point is that I want to run around with an mpx, MCX, and the g36 and destroy y'all in game. Hopefully without those ever being ""meta""."
Soulcaller,"This is for all the reddit opperators ""muh tarkov is realistic"" bellend mw2 more realistic the tarkov sit down."

hunky_paglia_fanboy,"People who didn't experience (or weren't good) during the Reserve wipe and the two (?) wipes afterward have no fuckin' idea what they missed.

The game and guns felt great. The eventual guarantee of the bitcoin farm meant you would have the chance to play with /cool kits/ and effective weaponry a few weeks into the wipe.

The movement system being generous - especially at 50 endurance/strength - is what made this game so fucking fun to play back then. You were rewarded for your map knowledge because valuable loot spawning in specific places gave each map its own flow.

Trying to play in any way that mimics that era where my friends and I LOVED this game is so far gone, thanks to the absurd changes to weight and stamina.

Even beyond that - making kits insanely expensive to repair and insure means that winning fights doesn't even feel that good anymore. The /real/ high of Tarkov was walking out of raid with the most valuable parts of three others' kits, tetris'd to oblivion. When I gave this most recent wipe a week of my time, I was just vendoring shit, and eventually going out near-naked; gear felt too expensive and too useless.

I have no idea what kind of game Nikita wants to make, but it won't be for anyone but him.

I got my money's worth - just such a damn shame they didn't realize what got people into this mess as players versus Landmark watchers. Pour one out."
TryptamineSpark,"It was in fact, a better game."
TigrexETH,"Hardcore MW2 no hud and quick ttk is so good right now in comparison. Guns feel great. When i lose I know it was because of me being out played.

Tarkov kills AND deaths are a coin flip. Have been for months.

This video is exactly what I‚Äôve been feeling for two wipes now."
TruantJosh,"Some of his points seem pretty good, especially regarding recoil and diving.  


His complaints about ""armor not working"" are pretty dumb and seem like he gets mad about dying while walking through entirely open unconcealed areas"
A_Ruse_ter,"BSG has conflated ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù with ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù. At this point, Call of Duty seems more realistic than Tarkov, and it‚Äôs directly because of the idea that if it‚Äôs hard, it‚Äôs realistic."
MediocreCheesecake15,As someone who has over 500 hours in this game I just realized that I have zero confidence using any weapon in the game currently. The ridiculous recoil coupled with the camera shake and terrible stamina has made playing this game very difficult for me. Before Tarkov it was CoD and I hated the style of game play. The stupid fucking jumping around corners with no stock AR's while still having laser precision was always the most eye rolling nonsense to me but I feel like Tarkov has gone in a completely opposite direction to the point where it feels like my character is anemic
Stew514,"When it comes to recoil, my biggest frustration is simply that I do not gain an adequate amount of precision and control when I make the decision to sacrifice mobility. That's not how it used to feel, and the captures he has of older combat illustrate how that particular part of the game used to be a lot more rewarding and fun than it feels right now."
Carter1k,Really good vid
salbris,"Another thing that could be making things feel worse is hit registration. Given the server issues we have now could it be that hits feel less reliable that they don't seem to go where they appear to go?  


Has anyone done some comprehensive tests in offline co-op?"
QuietGiygas56,I 100% agree with everything in the video. I doubt that it will result in much meaningful change though sadly. I hope it does though
Shift_Six,He‚Äôs right
kerz_,"Good video, perfectly explains my problems with the game as somebody who has played since 2018. I will most likely never play the game again due to the direction they have gone with it."
Pegasus969,"The state of the community is just sad. You can‚Äôt suggest any kind of productive criticism without getting told to ‚Äúget gud‚Äù or ‚Äúskill issue‚Äù or the classic ‚Äúgo play cod‚Äù I took the last 4 wipes off. Came back to major changes that occurred over that time off. A lot of which I do not like at all, which is just my personal opinion. But I have to wonder who is actually in favour of the dumb shit in the game right now like the stamina and rng recoil. Reddit is obviously not the full story of the community, but I do wonder if the player base is dwindling more than previous wipes."
Ashkonay,"I've been unhappy with the game for a while now and could not understand exactly what was making me feel that way. This video made me realize that everything I enjoyed about the game has been altered to the point that it now just frustrates me. I understand that there were issues in place before, but replacing those issues with mechanics that constantly frustrate me is not the solution.

I've stuck with the game not because of what it is now, but because of the nostalgia of what it used to be. At the end of the day, it's not my game and Nikita can do with it what he wishes. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to admit that the Tarkov I loved is gone. Hopefully if more people come to the same realization and stop playing, Nikita may admit that some of these changes may not have been for the best."
FullMetalAlex,Kinda wanna try COD now...
SquidNinja17,"Same, for the most part. I think inertia is still a must, but they over-corrected out the ASS when it came to ""slowing things down"". I've noticed that sums up what's wrong with pretty much EVERYTHING in the past decade- someone catches on that something needs to go in another direction, so they pick a slightly off version of that direction and run with it hundreds of miles too far, convincing everyone that it was never the right direction in the first place."
Nibbaslaya,"Excellent video, I agree with everything and I agree that the state of the game has been consistently decreasing. Nikita should decide to sell the game to someone who can improve upon it."
Ahugiaaa,"I'm pretty pissed that it's almost impossible to snipe after the first 5 minutes of a raid, since most loot hotspots are big buildings and have an extract right next to it.  Or there never is any good vantage point to have a nice overlook. Which kinda makes it so that there's only one playstyle available since Sneaking is bugged"
kellyjepsen,"Making noise when moving is bad game design. It rewards defensive rats, punishes aggressors, and makes any sort of tactical outplay impossible.

Inertia is bad game design. By trying to punish ‚Äòheavy/looted‚Äô players you‚Äôve successfully made garbage movement mechanics which literally have to be abused to be playable (running around in circles instead of strafe peeking).

Recoil is in a bad state because of movement. The movement is so slow and sluggish (not real, just slow) that without a hefty recoil punishment, shooting becomes too easy. It‚Äôs a balancing act, but instead of fluid movement and manageable recoil we have sluggish movement and bullshit recoil ‚Äî all in the name of ‚Äòrealism‚Äô.

Stamina system and it‚Äôs harsh penalties is bad game design. Why are we losing stamina for crouching/standing? Why do we want to actively discourage and penalise this mechanic when it‚Äôs already so slow? Why does jumping over a simple clipped fence take 6 attempts, where you have to wait for stamina to regain in between?

Whatever this game is chasing, it‚Äôs relentlessly forcing slower and slower and slower play."
CptnRatking,"Veritas pretty much nailed it completely with that video. But I'm seeing a lot of dumbfucks in here that disregard everything he had to say because ""he's a meanie ;("". Like holy shit, grow the fuck up lmao."
redgewell,I have never seen a video game community be so vocal.about something and the devs do absolutely nothing about it.
MOR187,They will remove his guitar pick after that one that's for sure :)
H0lzm1ch3l,"Most changes to the game are good. It goes forward. The feeling of control was lost. But it‚Äòs not hard to get back. Just tune down the overtuned introduced mechanics. Inertia was a great idea it just doesn‚Äòt allow enough mobility as it is right now. The system itself is brilliant, they just gave it too much impact. Same as weight."
KyleGuap,Please just fix the recoil it is insane how dogshit it is
KlausVonBob,I would give many things to go back to old recoil and better weapon sway in these clips.
erkkoo,"I still play this game as my main game even tho with all its issues that has come and gone over the years because there is no other game like it in terms of being a first person looter extraction shooter. 

I agree a lot with Veritas here and in fact with more or less all of the videos he has made recently regarding the issues with the game. But this video hit different‚Ä¶.

I started looking at old clips I have from the year I played the absolute most, 2020. And the insane difference in weapon recoil, being able to actually sneak up on your enemy‚Äôs using covert movement and being sneaky. I loved it so much. And not even the recoils was bad, from the clips I looked at it was at a sweet spot in my opinion. 

But now I feel like your PMC which is supposed to be a well trained fit mercenary and have combat experience and being able to handle firearms etc is a obese noodle armed soy drinking clumsy idiot that can‚Äôt shoot, can‚Äôt sneak at all because you are loud af regardless of gear or anything. You can only sprint for 10m and then huffing and puffing like a person that‚Äôs has been smoking cigarettes for 40 years. The core gameplay that makes this game awesome is currently broken in so many ways. 

I really hope Nikita and BSG takes this feedback from Veritas videos and implement them in to the game. This was and is in some ways still and absolutely can be the most hardcore and fun and immersive fps ever with some small changes and tweaks."
Skilldigga,"I just watched the whole thing and while I have to admit that I definitly dont share all of his points there are some which are quiet fitting.

Especially the Stamina Shit, the recoil and the audio. I hope then stumble upon his video, watch it with an open mind and try to understand why so many are frustated."
Zanena001,Current Tarkov realism is what basement dwellers who have never held a gun in their lives think realism is.
lukasgabriel333,"I really doubt BSG as a Company is able to address those issues.  
The development cycle for the last 1.5 years (maybe longer) focusses in my opinion way to much on shiny new things instead of actually trying to make the game better.   
Instead of a new Map fix the Cheater issue(There are alot of possibilities without a very good Technology, look at CS)  
Instead of implementing 2 new Sound Engines, test one appropriately and implement it nicely (Other Games implemented Steam Audio beautiful, why is BSG incapable of that)  
Instead of implementing the 500th new Weapon, reduce the wait time players have."
dorekk,"Veritas is absolutely correct, this video is a banger, and if BSG don't immediately learn some lessons from it their game is going to die."
Weekly_Cream200,Got to be new or delusional to enjoy this game for an extended period of time. Then again Nikita did say it's not meant to be enjoyed. I come to this sub every now and then for a good laugh.
ApeOfDiamondz,"I don‚Äôt agree with the meds and the armour. The medical animations are fantastic, and what they‚Äôre doing with the ammo, will bring the armour values back again."
P0werEdge,i do not agree with his armor remarks even more now since all good ammo is gone.
KlutzyAd5729,Late 2019 till mid 2020 was tarkovs golden era imo
LogicalNorth,"the recoil right now is so garbage now that its been a cat and mouse game of ""find the gun setup that does actual damage and doesn't have ridiculously stupid recoil"" and then bsg nerfing it seemingly on the basis of too many people using it  


there used to be a WIDE variety of viable weapon choices. there was always a meta gun or two that performed 10% better than others but you could take a ton of different guns into the raid and didn't feel like you were at a severe disadvantage in a fight. there was a point where m4s were good, hks were good,  rpks were good, m1as were good, val/vss was good, p90 was good, mpx was good, vector was good, mp9 was good, etc. some were better than others but all of them were completely viable.   


now you have to take 1 of 3 guns because they are the only ones even remotely usable"
SwiftBetrayal,You either die a hero or live long enough to see your self become a cheat riddled money grabbing hoe.
RobouteGuilliman,"This video highlights one thing that I think has always bothered me about Tarkov. The speed.

I know that people bang on about ""Realism"" and all that, but Tarkov moves at a speed that is so much slower than real life. It's clunky and uncomfortable to move and no that is not how real combat is."
kir44n,Back when the game was _good_ . Man do I miss the old days
NotARealDeveloper,"After having played mo*dded Tarkov, I can't go back to normal. It has everything that is shown in this video. A realistic recoil system, better AI, better stamina system, and much more."
CONVlCTlON,"Honestly we need this video to blow up, we need BSG to listen to this. this is the worse this game has ever felt."
CyrexPro_32,"I agree with some things but back then people were running and jumping around like drug addicts.  The recoil needs to be nerfed, especially the visual recoil, you should have more stamina and armor needs to be able to take more hits but not like we had before.  People were jumping off ladders while shooting full-auto AKs....we need to find a middle ground"
FoldFold,"I watched the entire thing and think this guy is indeed nostalgic, bitter, and probably needs to take a break from the game. I know the community clearly disagrees but I take a lot of issue with the content of this video. 

First and foremost, he almost seems to make an argumentative essay telling Nikita the game is not what he wants it to be. He cites the video series and a comment saying Nikita wants Tarkov to be like that. Ok, but Nikita didn‚Äôt say the game needs to be ENTIRELY like that. As he clearly recognizes, we concede several elements for game balance. 

His argument is also built on the back of the ‚Äúyou tell me [insert false claim about realism here]‚Äù. Who says that if not an extreme minority? Most everyone agrees that recoil is not right. Most everyone agrees this game is not entirely realistic. He makes it seem like he‚Äôs arguing against the community when he is preaching to the choir. 

When showing the first clip, what is clear is what we have lost graphically in Tarkov. Much of that has been given up for performance sake. He never EVER talks about that after, only his personal gripes with recoil, endurance, weight, peeking, and armor. 

**Recoil**

He spends like 5 minutes arguing against a minority of the community saying recoil is realistic. Anyone who has spent any time on Twitch or this subreddit knows Tarkov recoil sucks. But veritas, like you acknowledge, this game is not a realism simulator. If it were, this game would be DOMINATED by point and spray guns. Recoil is obviously a balance mechanic which could be done better, but exists so you can‚Äôt just get a nice kit after a couple days of hardcore grinding that makes everything else useless and deletes timmies.

**Endurance**

He clearly has a huge issue with endurance, zooming in on the effect when he is getting shot. Frankly I‚Äôm a bit confused what he wants? This is clearly a balance issue. Even CS, valorant, and Arcady shooters slow you when you‚Äôre getting shot because it‚Äôs just fair gameplay. No, if you‚Äôre getting shot in your thorax you may not be able to continue sprinting around as if nothing happened. You‚Äôve been hit, you‚Äôre at a disadvantage. Still, not sure what he wants. 

Also the adrenaline idea is so silly lol, at least how he implied it should be in the game. Imagine shooting someone‚Äôs hand so their adrenaline procs, so they can speed boost into your with 4 car batteries in their backpack and drop you. Does anyone really want adrenaline buffs? 

Then he shows clips of old gameplay where he is sprinting around dropshotting, jiggle peaking around rocks, and generally soaring around without much impedance. If that‚Äôs what you miss, ok‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not coming back. That‚Äôs been made clear by the last 3 years of development. 

**Weight**

Again, nothing about the weight system is entirely realistic Veritas. It is based on reality, but nobody could really run around with two full fuel cans on their back. Again, this is a balance element that punishes you for looting and running around with loot. It makes you make a decision whether you should haul around the loot or maybe drop some to stay agile. Is it perfect or finely tuned? No, I agree but you seem to prefer the way it used to be‚Ä¶ to which I say good for you, but it was not balanced nor did it make any sense. 

**Armor**

Oh the armor take was also hilarious. If armor is basically worthless, I want to see you live up to that Veritas. Run the rest of the wipe without it, or hell even just 40 raids. Let‚Äôs see how you really think about it then. Half of the clips he showed could have happened in the past as well, especially in the ones where he just getting head tapped. Head eyes has been a thing forever. 

**Sound**

Yes, sound is awful. Everyone thinks that. Not defending BSG here‚Ä¶ they should have absolutely tested their changes to sound. But covert movement is only recently broken and is more or less bugged, so I don‚Äôt see any value in attributing that to old Tarkov. 

‚Äî

As an overarching theme, he seems to have an emphasis on skill being the only way, or at least a major way, a player can succeed in Tarkov. This truly is not the game for that. Sometimes you do get lucky and sometimes you get unlucky. If that‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt like, this really isn‚Äôt the game for you. Of course your performance matters too, but it‚Äôs a fine balance which I think Nikita has done a decent job trying to strike. BSG is so far from perfect, but they certainly are better at designing games than streamers."
GdanskinOnTheCeiling,"https://old.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10jpz4z/on_veritas_latest_video/

Mostly good points, but some outright bad ones as well, and as usual with Veritas videos in my experience, it's wrapped up in a nice self-righteous finger-wag to the intellectually inferior viewer before he even gets started making any. Also a bit too meandering and stream-of-consciousness in it's presentation for me. Where is the straightforward point-by-point list of specific game mechanic changes that he wants people to consider? Once again I come away from a Veritas video wondering if he just really likes the sound of his own voice.

The thrust of the video seems to be a significant criticism of inertia and movement, and seems to be mostly asking for a return to the old Shift+W gameplay that Veritas excelled at in his heyday. There are definitely a lot of points here I agree with. Aim-punch is excessive, and should be toned down or arguably removed. Stam-punch shouldn't exist. Stam-drain from stance changes should either be heavily reduced or just removed. Inertia should perhaps be toned down a bit (but not removed! ADAD spam is fine in 128 tick CS, it's NOT FINE in 20-tick Tarkov). Stealth should be re-introduced (is this even a design decision? I thought it was an unintended consequence of the move to oculus audio).

However some of the points he makes I can't agree with.

At one point he mounts a (poor imo) defence of jiggle-peeking/pixel-peeking as being something 'real life' operators do, showing footage of a work of fiction as some kind of reinforcement of this point. He doesn't address how utterly incomparable pixel-peeking is compared to IRL blind-firing, just on a mechanical level (manipulating a gun in real time 3d space vs panning and clicking a mouse within an extremely limited and relatively fixed 2d plane mapped to a very consistent and fixed 3d perspective). Not to mention that comparisons to ""realism"" aside, pixel-peeking is horrific from an ""enjoyable"" gameplay perspective particularly in a game with such pronounced latency compared to other shooters. Who enjoys being insta-tapped around a corner by an enemy you can't see?

On general running/sprinting and stamina, he conflates Tarkov's unrealistically fast sprinting movement with the barely-faster-than-walking-pace running/jogging of real life operators. He seems to try to make the point that much of the old shift+w movement isn't ""unrealistic"" because operators can ""run for miles"" with gear on. Sure, they can slowly jog for miles. They can't Tarkov-sprint. I doubt we'll go back to the movement that Veritas seems to want. If anything, I'm expecting Nikita to drop the patch that lowers movement speed across the board, halves or quarters the stamina bar again, and increases raid timer, and forces us into the kind of slow, tactical gameplay that Nikita seems to want, where sprinting as a mechanic is relegated to getting you 10 metres from cover A to cover B as you slowly traverse the map over the course of an hour, because you can no longer marathon sprint with a couch on your back from one end to the other in a few minutes like you're the fucking T-1000. Maybe, like with stances, we need an intermediate movement speed between walking and sprinting, something like the jogging that we see from the soldiers in the stock footage Veritas showed us. Maybe walking doesn't drain stam, jogging drains it very slowly, sprinting tanks it.

Of the three options (shift+w, what we have now, and walking/jogging-sim) I honestly don't know which I would end up preferring. I do know that old giant-stam-bar no inertia insta-peeking ADAD-spam Shift+W meta we used to have makes a mockery of the very idea of Tarkov evoking a feeling of 'realism' or authenticity for the players. That really is CoD by another name.

And on the comparisons to CoD, Veritas is a bit cheeky here imo by entirely framing his points - and his finger-wagging to the alpha-chad whatever-he-called it strawman at the start of the video - around comparing smoothness of gun manipulation and recoil in modern Call of Duty titles to Tarkov's relative clunkiness. In the case of myself and friends and acquaintances of around my age, when we decry Tarkov becoming like Call of Duty we aren't talking about modern CoD titles that have all the fancy gun manipulation displayed in Veritas' video. (In fact I couldn't even tell you which Call of Duty is being played in the footage. Is it this Warzone I see people talking about?). Our frame of reference for ""arcadey"" Call of Duty gameplay is still the original CoD4 (or maybe even og MW2 for the younger millennials). And that frame of reference is still valid IMO. Hell, given the responses to that 'what age are you?' thread the other day, it wouldn't surprise me if the majority of Tarkov players hold the same or similar frame of reference as me re what constitutes 'CoD gameplay'.

Point being, I don't want Tarkov to include sprinting-around-a-held-angle-into-a-drop-shot-10-metres-in-front-of-the-enemy-who-cant-even-see-you-go-prone-due-to-desync as a legitimate means of 'outplaying' them. This isn't og CoD4 shipment MP5s at dawn ffs. Ironically this is exactly what Veritas shows us several times in his montage of the good times where he excelled. I'm happy for Veritas that he has the dexterity, and the confidence in the effects of pronounced latency, to regularly pull this gamer move off. It looks good to watch as a viewer and I'm sure it feels good to do as a player and streamer, for a multitude of reasons. I just don't think it belongs in Tarkov. Neither do akimbo shotguns for that matter.

As far as Veritas video goes, I'll grant him that probably two thirds of it was comprised of valid points about the game, but to me the remaining third very much came across like one of the criticisms he pre-emptively attacked in his opening monologue - a whine by a veteran streamer who has nostalgia for how good he used to be and who wants things to go back to the way they were then, forgetting how shit Tarkov has been in the past compared to how it is today. In fact, part of me wonders whether it's even possible for the game to be in an acceptable state to Veritas. He sounds utterly burnt out. If the game entirely changed today to fit his precise requirements, would he go back to how he was at the beginning of his Tarkov career, not in skill but in attitude and temperament towards the game and towards other players? Back when he was enjoyable to watch and listen to.

My worry now is that this video and the points within, even the bad ones, are uncritically accepted by the community at large and that Nikita is pressured into capitulating. I would rather Nikita and BSG focus on tackling the three most consequential issues with the game today (netcode, cheaters, audio) than to revert much-needed bandaids like inertia to suit the whims of yet another aggrieved streamer whos milkshake no longer brings the boys to his yard.

PS: I'm enjoying this wipe. Anyone else?"
pasiutlige,"There are a lot of good points, but at same time - some of the changes simply HAD to happen.

The last montage of ""old days"" sort off shown just how broken the recoil system was for some specific meta weapons, and how movement was way too cracked.

But the armor and healing changes were in good direction.

The inertia could get some more adjustments, or maybe not the intertia itself - but the available stamina? The recoil definitelly needs a look, but I am advocating for a recoil we control ourselves, and not something game does for you. Because every single time some sort off ""META"" pops out with a laser setup that way.

No idea why the blind fire mechanics were gutted like that though."
VurtuneMTG,"The most concerning issue for me is the lack of proper Optimization.   
I am playing this Game since 2018, have an insane RIG rn (5800x3D, 32Gig 3666 mhz ram, 3060ti) and still dont achieve a stable FPS higher then 80ish. Important being ""STABLE"" here. Currently im done with Tarkov and will only recommend this game when they fix their bad perfomance."
Midgetben1234,Dayum I‚Äôm actually blown away by this video really didn‚Äôt realise how good we had it when I first started playing and how far something I love to bits has fallen it‚Äôs genuinely sad that this is the case and I hope to Nikita the god himself or whoever watches this video and sees this because the game is just not as fun as it used to be anymore
GenSoapGuga,"I don't think inertia is a problem in Tarkov, bcuz fights back then resumed in ""peek, shoot and hide"" in under 0.5 seconds and you'd get insta head, eyes every time. The big issue is around the weight and stamina drain that is just awful.

Recoil is also the worst decision they've made so far. Before 12.12 I thought recoil of Tarkov was so good and rewarding when you mounted that meta gun, but not it's just stupid to use full auto with anything but 9mm (excluding Vector, bcuz holy shit) or .45 subs.

Optmization in this wipe is absolutely trash. Streets is so much fun to play, but I can't play it over 30 FPS, and the game consumes so much RAM it's ridiculous, it's practically impossible to play with only 16 GB, i mean wtf is this."
RedneckR0nin,His thoughts are mine and everyone else that played this game for longer than two years. I'm glad the people on their second wipe are having fun....but that is because you don't know any better about how good this game USED to be....and every single day on the forum and on here I see more and more threads saying fuck this game.....and I for one can't make any more excuses for it any longer....after 2.5 years of trying to reason with people on making them stay......the game is fucking garbage now....pure fucking garbage..........oh yeah...TRUST the PROCESS...unless that process has shown flushing a once great game down the fucking shitter...at that point fuck the process......and fuck Whomever trusts it...its not worthy of our trust any longer.
momba95,"We need to remember thats its always a videogame so, was it more enjoyable for the majority of the players? If yes, the game was just better before. Simple"
voxyvoxy,"I get the distinct feeling that many of the players who watch the video, and come away thinking ""huh, didn't think of these issues this way, what a nice and insightful essay"", will shit on people complaining about ANY of these issues on the sub.

Basically, I'm saying that y'all (the git gud crowd) are a bunch of hypocrites ( you know who you are)."
hooblyshoobly,"The video is conflicting because I agree with much if not all of his talking points, however his attitude doesn't at all reflect what I experienced tuning into his stream a few times recently. People with different opinions were absolutely shit on, he was in a foul mood and a few times replied with ""I simply don't care about your opinion"" to randoms discussing the game in chat, even when they weren't being condescending or trying to incite argument. 

I also don't think the instant drop shotting and sprint jumping into prone/crouch with no delay gun ready clips were well placed, is that really something we miss from older iterations? Shooting someone who turns from a 6ft hitbox to 1ft in 250ms? Despite all of this I cannot deny the gun play now and general armour balance is horrendous and he's absolutely right in saying the game used to reward skill more as you weren't fighting the mechanics in order to kill someone. 

My concern about all of this is despite me liking tighter gunplay/movement is that undoubtedly the desync issues were even more prevalent then. If you enjoyed winning a fight because you felt you bested the other person, the speed with which you could jiggle or wide swing... did they really see you in a fair and meaningful way? Or did you succeed because of the underlying spaghetti we still see to this day on the receiving end? That's another discussion though and shouldn't mean we don't go towards refinement, just that the networking needs to improve in-line with tighter control of our PMCs."
Representative-Dig16,"I was called crazy and skill issue when I said COD has better gunplay than Tarkov by the wannabe realism people and look where we are. All of these people are really silent now. 

With that being said I don't want CODs gunplay, I want Tarkov's gunplay before the recoil changes. It wasn't COD, although there were some examples which did deserve changes, and it's also not the garbage we have right now. 

Also can we fix some of the scopes. Veritas also made an old video about the scopes before the ""scopes rework"" and they ruined so many scopes with the dark shadow around the inside of the scope."
MaxBonerstorm,"There is a few glaring issues with this video.

The main one is that his entire point of ""adrenaline"" and being able to sprint around after being shot would entirely remove bolt action guns from viability (even more so than now) and long range play would be ""headshot them mid sprint or you aren't getting the kill""

All of these points are basically catered to a playstyle thats entirely centered around shift+w Call of Duty type gameplay. Which I am sure people like Veritas are singuarly good at, but there are quite a few people who like to play at range in this game on purpose. 

I fully disagree with Veritas on his movement points."
rinkydinkis,"Retweet.   I actually think a lot of the gunplay in cod looks and feels great.  The unrealistic part is just in the movement speed, radar, hit markers and kill streaks"
pkm3plox,"Tarkov really is at an all time worse. Sad to see it like this. 

Coupled with the horrible dsync that I constantly experience in streets. Just make the game frustrating and makes me not want to play it."
ThunderLips4,100% agree with player movement and gun handling. It feels so unrealistic now.
olishoplifter,"Man this hits right in the feels and makes me miss the game I fell in love with. It wasn't perfect, but there was a certain charm about it that's long been buried over the years. At this point I'm convinced anyone that thinks these changes were are any good for the game are just not FPS players and are not very good at shooting games to begin with. Pretty soon we will have to click to where we want to move our player and select to engage in combat."
Psychological-Monk30,"It's funny how he sound so calm in his video but when you go to his livestream he is raging/screaming and acting like an i know it all arrogant teenager who just insult everyone in his chat while calling out everyone in the tarkov community to be braindead, ignorant and having the mental capacity of a 2 years old unless they praise his ideology.  ( btw i never talk in his chat it's not even worth it )

Also if anyone like him for those 1 hour video it's kinda ironic because he said on stream he could simply make a 5-10 min video to explain all this but the player base are so ignorant and braindead that they need to be taken by the hand since they are too dumb to understand a short one.

His own word : if people think they know what they want they're wrong, because they are too ignorant to know what they want. I know what they want, they don't.

If we could convert his ego into a source of energy we would be able to create an artificial sun out of the energy it provide."
Iiana757,"Personally disagree with his opinions, it is what it is. He shows footage and talks about how mobility was better back in the day and showcases dolphin diving and insta peeking. Personally i fucking hated that. Inertia is one of the single best additions to the game imo. The whole video is basically ""how not to say u want tarkov to be twitchy fast gameplay like cod without actually saying it"". Its his opinion and thats fair enough, but i personally disagree that the game was better before inertia.

Yes recoil can be better, yes camera shake with recoil can be better. The thing to keep in mind though is that if all guns had zero recoil like they do irl then everything would be a laser. Which, imo, would make for horrible gameplay. Sometimes video game balance needs to come before realism (in his sense from the video).

As a side not its also pretty arrogant of him to say ""this is what Nikitas vision is"" when hes not Nikita nor a mind reader. Only Nikita knows what Nikita wants"
overwatchlap,Any written summary for those who don't watch the video?
GlupShittoOfficial,"Love this video. I do agree there needs to be a middle ground before we revert back to max strength chads super man jumping every where but that is more a fault of the skill system than anything else. 

Honestly I think COD has a nice system with the double sprint mechanic. Essentially the default run and then an extra burst sprint that has a longer cool down. Tarkov could have the default sprint be slower but take very little stamina and then the full sprint that effectively drains all your stamina very quickly."
LargeSticker,This video needs to be seen by anyone who has a legitimate interest in the game becoming 1.0
RegalMuffin,I've been saying this a lot over the last couple of years. 2 years ago I would quickly recommend eft to those interested in it and loved the level of realism as well as the flow that playing had. While we have more content now with 2 really big map drops and a large amount of expansion to maps that were in when I started playing the game itself feels worse and I unfortunately feel that a lot of what changes that feeling is just intended direction.  This isn't even coming from a Chad style player I'm among the trashiest level of rat there is but the game moves further away from where I felt it was best.
FistsoFury,"Great video. I personally think post med animations and mag packing tarkov is better. They add decisions to the game while in raid that can be meaningful at times and I think it's overall a good thing. But I really really miss the fights from like 11.5 to 12.9ish Era. 12.11 was okay too though recoil was a bit too high on certain guns. Then 12.12 hit with huge nerfs to gameplay everywhere and its been nerf after nerf ever since. Now fights feel awkward and cumbersome with huge amounts of rng because we lack real control over our weapons and our pmcs. Huge weapon sway, massive recoil, overtuned weight system and inertia..  it all adds up to making gameplay feel tedious and frustrating and detracts from the fun. We don't really need to revert everything but I think that recoil needs to come way down and be far more controllable. The weapon sway has to be brought back down as well. Ease up a bit on the weight system. Add like a green and orange level of penalties so the jump to overweight early on in a raid isn't so harsh or something. I don't think weight should affect Inertia as heavily as it does and if you add more steps in the weight system that might smooth it out and make it feel better. Also tighten up base Inertia in general I still feel like I'm on ice at times which just never feels okay. Sprinkle some stamina buffs in and I think movement would feel pretty okay. Lastly they should definitely buff armor. Reduce blunt damage or something. I miss being able to survive fights with a zeroed armor instead of dying with my armor at half durability. Maybe give 5 more hp to limbs to further pad ttk or something. I think doing that with recoil low and controllable again would make the ttk feel decent while also making gunplay feel damn good again. Would overall be such a win for the game"
TheWhiteOnyx,"As someone who started playing in 2020, holy fuck that montage at the end was amazing. The recoil and movement are so much worse now"
DanskJeavlar,"He put the dot over the i.      
The montage at the end was the reason i got this game and i have never experienced anything close to it."
Jusaaah,"I feel like many changes to the game are also made in order to hide the atrocious netcode.   


make peeking slower so peekers advantage is not as easy to notice etc."
Jertzukka,Spot on. I agree with most except that jumping should be a valid tactic in a firefight.
SyntheticSins,I have so many of the same gripes.
Leytarkhan,"I support what he says in this video.

There are some things I dont like about the Arcady tarkov that he liked namely being able to heal everything instantly I think injuries etc. should have a longer effect on you than just being healed away with no animation and just ploop everything healed good to go.

Jumping around like a Rabbit or downplaying injuries.

Everything else: weapon handling, sound, armor etc. are all valid."
LordLoy,I cant believe there used to be a day you can see people while spraying
nonamejustthing,Has everyone forgotten ADAD spam? Sprinting pirouettes out in the open to dodge bullets like the Matrix? Recoil needs to be toned down a lot (and pivot at the shoulder rather than the pistol grip for weapons with stocks) but inertia is exclusively a good change.
KaNesDeath,All subsystems Nikita has implemented over the years dont work independently and or in conjunction with one another. I blame this not only on him but the ARMA/DayZ players who want systems that think annoyance means fun.
Thebottlemap,"I agree with most points but his take on armor is way off.

In his compilation video of why armor is redundant, he plays a bunch of clips where he gets headshot killed... With no head armor..

Armor is in a good spot now. Not useless, not OP. 

Other than that good points."
WingsOfWingsOf,"A good video indeed. Highlights most of the actual gameplay issues that BSG CAN FIX, but they won‚Äôt since they are incompetent. 

These aren‚Äôt things like cheater or servers. These are fundamental gameplay issues."
Professional_Tank_38,"Flip Floppy, real life examples to support what he likes while ignoring real life examples that won't support what he likes.

Stop using real life to try to improve the game, it won't work."
PutridAppointment69,"Fuck all this whining about this game not being a cracked out twitchy shooter where players run around with 120lbs worth of top tier gear while brushing off 7.62 rounds hitting them in the dick to no effect. I want the audio, net code, and anti cheat to work at a fundamental level. Everything else can be tweaked later on."
Wulfgar_RIP,"40 minutes of skill issue /s

PS I also enjoyed Klean's reaction to this video https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1716036270?t=2h37m21s (this is end part)"
MatticInYoAttic,"Tarkov over the past two years seems to only be interested in trying to nerf streamers - which makes the game that much harder for those who don't play the game for a living.. and nerfing RMT - which makes it harder on everyone else. And the excuse everyone pushes is that it's for realism - this game has never been realistic, and it hasn't gotten anymore realistic with any of these changes. 

The recoil & weight system changes have made the game much less fluid & way more clunky. At the very least they should have added a mantle system or something so you don't have to jump up to these stupid little ledges that you shouldn't ever fail but you do because you're heavy as balls."
TheJonJonJonJon,"I think Veritas is very much someone who enjoys the smell of his own farts but, his in depth Tarkov videos are very interesting. The audio one he did a while back was very good!"
CheekiBreekiDuty,"Recoil and weapon handling? Entirely correct, but movement, armor, and inertia changes? Absolutely not. You should not be able to jump around like a Kenyan and take mosin rounds to the face, the way he used to play is disgusting and does not belong in tarkov. You should not be able to sprint or move much at all after taking a 3 inch slug to the chest. Time to kill should be even lower and armor less effective, frankly. Recoil however should be nerfed to the fucking ground."
Hybrid-Black,god that made me miss old tarkov so much
NeverLace,"Copying my comment

22:41 I dont buy these examples. In what of those clips can you show that you took armor damage? To me it seems like you were moving slow and got headshot on most of those examples. Can you instead show examples of where you die a thorax/stomach death, show what rounds hit and where?

Your same argument can be used against you at 37:06, where you take down  2 guys way more geared than you, with alot of armor, since you headjaws/headeye'd them(Because they were stanind still, or moving slow, just as in your death examples.)

Instead, show how examples of how armor got worse over time, how you tank less shots etc.

Thats the only flaw i see otherwise i enjoyed your video."
bass_voyeur,"This video makes a lot of good points. I agree with the recoil. I don't agree as much about movement, but I think there's a middle ground between Tarkov of old versus now. 

The video links to footage of 'actual real life Giga Chads' to demonstrate they can run 12 miles with 50 lbs on their pack. But I think this actually undermines his point rather than supports it. Soldiers running the 12 mile ruck average just over 4mph (I think the US Army standard is a 15-minute mile) while in light clothing and with their weapon. In EFT, we have fully kitted out PMCs, with gun, armor, headsets, clothing on, in addition to >50 lbs of backpack & loot - and PMCs average much better than a 15-minute mile (we even have the in-game statistics to calculate this ourselves if we want to). Generally speaking, our PMCs are both heavy and fast. So I think the current running and inertia is okay (could use some tweaking). But I do agree with the points about stamina, which which the video demonstrates current issues, like when we get shot or come out of crouches. And definitely agree on the issues of covert movement, which is so loud these days as to be entirely unusable."
Religionbedumb,They don‚Äôt give a fuck. They‚Äôre milking the train wreck for as long as possible using the least amount of money.
MaousWOL,"I think veritas hit the nail on the head people don't know what the hell they are talking about and just defend everything that makes the game slower and harder as realism.

Big raid backpack irl SHIPPING weight with the box and packing material is 2.2kg attack 2 is 1.89 kg. In tarkov 6.8kg and 6.4kg like why is an empty bag in tarkov triple its real life weight for no reason.

Stamina and aim stamina is so far past realism it can only be defined as a joke it's not even ""arcade"" level of unrealistic anymore.

I don't hate the entire interia system, but many parts of it are way too overtuned past being any sort of realistic. Blindfire nerfs are just a small part of it.

Found in raid is about the least realistic mechanic in the game, I understand it's value for questing to make things more difficult, but it just really kills me when people defend it with realism rofl. Could you even imagine a world where you couldn't trade or buy things from someone that didn't aquire it themselves. Not even grocery stores would exist. There's almost no aspect of our modern lives where the things we aquire aren't passed through multiple hands.

I'm not going to get into the topic of helmets because it's a Grey area that needs to be balanced via game type mechanics, but body armor nerfs over the years have added up to a level of ridiculousness that I feel needs touched on. Many top tier armors have become so completely unusable they might as well not be in the game because all the little things they've done have added up to being actual detrimental to your survival and enjoyment to even attempt to wear them."
Neolism,"His clip about armor, on multiple occasions, showed a shadow of a PMC not wearing any helmet."
Arel203,"I was someone who wanted inertia early on... but all the things I wanted inertia for have not been fixed, and the game is now a clunky mess.

This nonsense about not wanting people to be able to do quick movements is so insanely dumb. The points he made about the raid series and how combat is approached are so accurate. Humans aren't slow-motion boats. It makes me believe all these people shouting ""realism"" are all obese neckbeards that can barely get through a doorway in under 5 minutes in order to think these 2 second ironsight stabilization times are ok.

I wanted inertia only to make sniping more viable and prevent people from zigzag sprinting to avoid any chance of being sniped, but that really hasn't been affected much, and now in hindsight, with how clunky they've made all forms of combat... I'd rather they not expand on it AT ALL. EVER.

The weight system is fine, although the stamina system isn't. As shown in the video, it's not realistic to ever have unrecoverable stamina. Especially when a raid is only 30 minutes to an hour. Are we playing fat George as our PMCs? Or are we playing soldiers? Especially ones in high adrenaline life or death ""raids""?

Inertia needs to go. It's been a terrible addition to the game. Combat is no longer skill based. It's leveled-skills based. Strength should just be removed as a stat if they want to stop monkey movements. Because as it is, you can still do plenty of ridiculous leaps and jumps so long as you're leveled. The game has plenty of other stats to level."
vindico1,"BSG devs are just straight up incompetent. There is a middle ground between old combat and new combat, but because they don't play their own game they have no idea how to implement decent and well balanced changes."

Keeperofthe7keysAf-S,Veritas is 100% correct here.
toastybutthurts,"Not going to lie, it kind of sounds like he should just play COD. He has a bit of a hard on for it anyways."
pthumerianhollownull,I like current direction more. Almost all his old clips not a good argument of a good gameplay in his opinion.
Sensitive-Werewolf27,"Trade offer:

Old recoil, stamina when being shot gets a small boost rather than decrease, and armor that works

In exchange..

You can no longer store ammunition on your secure container"
