Magnon,"That's hilarious, hand suck go!"
jballin99,I do something similar when I look for whole blocks of cheese in the fridge to eat.
L0mad,WIND TUNNEL!
DirtyFuckingCasual,When do we fuck the robots
Pegussu,"The best looting system is Prey. Its crafting system just requires the basic elements that make up the items. You can do this by putting items into a machine called a recycler which helps justify the gamer tendency to collect any and all garbage on the map. Alternatively, you can throw a fucking implosion grenade that'll suck in items and then blow up, turning them into crafting materials."
JPShiryu,So basically Luigi's Mansion?
SableHalloway,This loot system sucks.
TransientMovement,I‚Äôm so down for that. One of my biggest pet peeves is having to hover over every fucking item to pick it up. Even worse in games like cyberpunk when mooks you kill land on top of their weapons and you have to push their body to pick it up. Just give me aoe looting
BoBoBearDev,Why does it looks like some kind of sex organ on the hand?
AviRei9,I'm trying to imagine if only looting was like this in Skyrim but it would only work if we didn't have the weight limit let me just magic everything into my inventory I mean it could have easily have been a spell but I feel like it would have been a spell and oblivion because that's when magic was Op
CaveManta,"Nice and quick, with lots of suction."
KJ117420,Mine
Cute-arii,"it looks so stupid. i love it so much.  
THE WAY ITS JUST CASUALLY ~~SUCKING GYRATING PULSATING~~ GOING IN AND OUT OF HIS HAND!!!"
DrDeathRow,Similar to Kirby
Lj28_,dontputyourdickonthat
No_Establishment7368,"Suddenly, the looting in borderlands feels embarrassingly outdated. Can we get a mod to add this looting system to every game? XD give me all loot in the immediate vicinity"
ADudeThatPlaysDBD,It looks stupid. I love it
RonYarTtam,At this point they should just stick everything in your inventory when you walk in the room. What's the point of this? I feel like the idea of looting is that you can MISS things by overlooking them. You might as well skip the animation.
jackofspades476,"Ok, this is probably an unpopular opinion, but I really like normal looting. I know it takes time but in my experience the time it takes is a good chill piece of time after a fight, or a tense sequence, and it really helps the pacing of a game. Also I‚Äôm a fan of realism in games, but I can definitely see the appeal of this method!"
CROBAHR,Getting old Blood Omen vibes like when you could feed on corpses around a room.
DocMachina,"I love seeing devs take unusual approaches to tired formulas. No one wants to rummage through drawers like on Red Dead 2. It's just little things like this that make me hopeful for the future of games, even if it doesn't seem all that mind blowing. It's the small things"
NoSleepReader,I feel like I've been waiting for this game to come out for 5 years. Is it even real?
thetalker101,"I wonder how this feature can be considered from a game ""philosophy"" perspective. Such as how it simplifies looting to an interesting visual but still has requirements to loot. I think it will be a fun mechanic, but I wonder if it will age well."
,"Looks really convenient, as opposed to rummaging through things one by one."
Bigred2989-,Reminds me of Luigi's Mansion.
ataeil,This is reverse Fus Ro Dah
IMarioKart7toomuch64,"That looks awesome, & saves so much tedious time opening & closing drawers & dressers. Why isn't this in more games?"
Ridiculous_Death,"Remember, when you buy this game you are directly funding russian missiles that kill kids."
SergeantSchmidt,"Atomic Heart, Sons of the Forest and Hogwarts Legacy feel too good to be true after so many botched AAA Titles/delays. 
Hope everything goes well. I crave for a game to suck me in again."
Martencel,Russian game development at it's peak
truthpooper,Pretty delightful
akakaze,Poltergeist Simulator.
Kear_Bear_3747,THANK. FUCK. *sluuuuuurp*

haxic,"Niiiice. I‚Äôm not playing a lot of loot oriented rpg‚Äôs, but I played Dying Light 2 and it fucking sucked to loot items in it‚Ä¶"
brockwuzhere,God this game looks so fucking good I cannot wait.
Grenflik,It's like Vampire Hunter D's left hand.
gn01145600,Imagine guy be doing their favourite activity with this super power.
Untouchable4rc,I just picked up Dying Light 2 so watching this makes me salivate.
Jam_God-1,Robbers in the year 2504
ZzzSleep,The Luigi‚Äôs Mansion method
HadeTUM,Moira mf
multiversalnobody,That looks awful
LopsidedImpression44,Ewe not even good in the least. May as well just press a button when you walk into the room and all doors and drawers fly open and you just have the loot in your inventory. So bad
R0B0138,Reminds me a bit of the Sekiro loot system
SardonicHistory,Not a fan. I always enjoy methodically searching stuff.
Deathstranger,"So, someone on the team just saw the maintenance person I'm sure and figured why not attach a vacuum to the character's hand for quicker looting."
,I‚Äôm waiting for it to come out on game pass is it good?
Holiday_Car_371,Summons black hole
marco_flores,Looks so downgraded compared to the trailer they showed in the past.
LachoooDaOriginl,i just looked up the game and looked at images and what in the fuck is this game
Curse3242,RDR2 and every ubisoft/bethesda game just puked
Current_Entrance_141,"I know it's just a game, but it russian games currently, and developers'll pay taxes and support war. I hope you will understand me"
PsyFi_ZA,"I love fast looting systems in games. 

One of the things that made me stop playing RDR2 was looting... It was so slow it literally made me refund the game."
Susdoggodoggy,Am I the only one who‚Äòs thinking about the vibe check?
CaffeineandSheen,So stoked to play this
xQuizate87,Is this game going to be good?
GUTSY-69,#SUCC
Teoxtli,"this is actually so much nicer than walking up to each individual container to open in and grab what's inside, reminds me of the gravity gloves from half life alyx (although those were really fun to use in vr)"

DevastaTheSeeker,??? Isnt the game out next month?
OSRS_Satriani,"I want this game to be good so badly, but it looks like it might have so many issues"
AS-46,Don't forget that it's russian game and you'll support a terrorist state by buying it
yaosio,"I've said before that given what the game has gone through it's either going to be the worst game ever made, or the greatest game ever made that introduces new concepts nobody has thought of doing before.

Here's a new concept that nobody has thought of doing before. Looks like Starfield needs to be delayed some more to add the vacuum loot feature."
Sky-Dear,Looks like ass
who-ee-ta,"Nice try, ivan, but noüñï"
jim9162,This is a nice change to the stopping and looking through every single shelf and mashing a button to loot everything not nailed down.
Perpetualityy,How I loot my fridge when I'm stoned to the bone at 3 am
Dry-Wave-6865,I'm gonna loot their mom
ChillYota,"Ohhhhhh looks nice! Especially for console players, trying to get right on the spot to pick something up can be very annoying"

Mattt_MSI,I'm looking forward to playing this but I just hope it isn't a flat feeling game with lots of difficult boss fights üòÆ‚Äçüí®
b_lett,Half-Life Alyx was supposed to be like a 15 hour game. I spent about 30 hours because I manually had to open every cupboard and drawer and toilet seat in VR. This type of loot system would have shaved so much time off my playthrough.
KnobbyDarkling,Do you think he uses that for...y'know?

sussybatman,Is it out already??
GabagoolsNGhosts,Okay I love this. More hyped. Please don't stink!
GildedGimo,"My favorite system is still sekiro. For anything small you just hold a button and automatically grab everything no matter which direction you are looking or anything. And you can do it from quite far away. Important items you still have to pick up, so you know you're about to get something worth looking at."
Zombitchy,It's hilarious but wildly convenient?
GabagoolsNGhosts,"If we have cookies in the house I'll joke that I walk into the kitchen and go ""Iiiiiiiiiiiiiii want a cookie"" (and during the extended ""Iiiiiiiiiii"" my mouth is open and all the cookies fly into my mouth)"
