rhif-wervl,"after 340 hours on this playthrough i think its time to call it a complete. I say 'complete' only because my computer is started to slow and crash the game.   
I've been able to create a 28/28/7/7 (of the four end game products per minute) over three factories supported by three nuclear complexes totalling 93 reactors with a large portion of the Plutonium being sunk. Since the end products are getting sunk im hovering about 25 million points/min in the sink.   
Most of the outposts create ingots using the 'efficient' recipes where water is added and trains carry it around the map. power usage is about 150,000MW.   
The crunch is coming to running out of cerium and copper veins around the map, while I'm using less then half the available iron."
Degree_Glittering,I spend about 500 hours on a single factory now before I move onto the next. I like to build huge and create a story in my head on why everything is placed how it is. My Refined Power Boiler setup is currently on 200 hours and it's like 40% done lol.
chriiissssssssssss,"Your Power production is highly fluctuating...
But otherwise pretty impression. Especially for 340 hrs"
captainfactoid386,As someone only at the Rank 5 tech I am scared
AlexIsPlaying,Until the next update! :P
99volt,This is my dream. I still get can't past the part of the game where I need to start expanding to other regions. So daunting. Good stuff!
Protheu5,">223 GW capacity

Holy wow. My dude, you outperformed Germany in power production capacity."

TASTY_TASTY_WAFFLES,Love it! I'm just moving into top tier production and rails are giving me a headache with all of these modular factories required! How did you decide what to produce where?
sp847242,Ok so what's up with that tiny spot of radiation near the northern-center there? :)
Phoojoeniam,Awesome! Now you can spend your time tracking down all the machines that are idling and get that consumption and max consumption to match lol
dmigowski,But where is the nut?
biondo86,you shouldnt have gone to use plutonium. best is to sink the rods before using them
flac_rules,"From where do you get the ""secondary reources"" for you western nuclear plant?"
GaidalKain,wow
