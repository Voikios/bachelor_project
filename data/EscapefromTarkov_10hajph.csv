xXPumbaXx,"By the fifth shot, I knew the uninstall was coming"
LakeEffectSnow,I'm not sure folks realize just how emotionally healthy that was for him.
retronax,"I count at least 7 hits and yet the scav is neither limping nor having breathing issues which means that not only did this not kill him, but neither his legs or stomach are blacked out. Its armor looks like 6B23-1 which is Class 3 which PS should pierce without issues. There is no defending this"
waituntilthis,"No helmet and two headshots should be death with ANY ammo type

Edit inbf4 ""but what about rubber bullets"" yeah yeah you know what i mean man"
pesoaek,"everyone in this thread acting like this is normal.

just shows how bad the AI is, barely even a reaction to being shot to shit, they just feel no pain at all."
Crzystona,I recently played for 4 hours beat my longest shot recorded then uninstalled for better mental health
vgamedude,"If I had posted this I would've gotten ""skill issue"".

Very realistic combat sim! People still insist tarkovs terminator ttk is realistic too."
BoldFacedUsername,I don't watch dr. Disrespect so this is my first time seeing that beautiful background. Total class
TheFunkadelicOne,"I've literally been there. The amount of shots I put I to scavs on shoreline doing punisher part 1 only to have them not die to a headshot this wipe is ridiculous. Idk if it's the akmn or the ps ammo or a desync issue, but something is bugged this wipe"
FactHot5239,This is just reinforcing my theory of 7.62 PS being bugged. The hit registration on that specific round is wildly inconsistant.
Shawn_NYC,"We used to complain Nikita only balanced the game for streamers.  But with the biggest gaming streamers uninstalling Tarkov over all the BS (Summit, disrespect) it's gotten to the point where Tarkov is only balanced for 24/7 Tarkov streamers."
Mithrandeere,That's really bad PR. Tarkov is busted.
avowed,"Call me crazy but you shouldn't be able to return accurate fire after eating that much lead, shit tier ammo or not. Even wearing armor. You will break rips being hit that close with a rifle round."
WienerDogMan,"The most annoying part of the ai doing things like this is the lack of self preservation. 

It‚Äôs beyond abnormal for a living being to walk towards that which is shooting them repeatedly. Ignoring the damage it is taking. It‚Äôs like terminator level behavior."
Dmane187,"I can‚Äôt begin to tell ya how many times this wipe I‚Äôve shot scavs with 7.62x39, 10-12 times before they drop. Armored and naked. 7.62x39 is a hard hitting, very powerful round. This is a problem, especially with it being such a popular round."
SweetMeal1414,This game is so bad lmao
,"Yup, uninstalled."
Brooksy925,"I‚Äôve never played this game, came across this post in Popular, i only have one question:

*What in the Fallout 76 is this fucking bullet sponge shit?*

I thought this was a proper game?"
Conbain,Pretty easy to sum it up. The game is trash. There ya go.
Euphoric_Ad_522,"Sometimes I get a bad feeling when shooting at certain scavs and just accept my fate. If they haven't dropped by the third shot, you're fucked."
butlerboy234,Mmm realism
WordfromKirb,"It still baffles me how terrible this game can be, after 7 years of development, youd think it would be better *says as I load up another raid*"
TheFlabbs,I‚Äôve been taking a break from Tarkov and playing other games and believe it or not guys I actually feel kind of happier. This game is soul sucking
01brhodes,"Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead."
Comfortable_Power108,Happened to me 3 times today. The scavs are still broken as fuck.
DreadPirateSnuffles,I was considering buying this game cause I like realistic shooters with low time-to-kill but.. apparently that's not EFT from all the clips I'm seeing...
eDaymoss,skill issues
Uniquely_structured1,"Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because DRD was already dead."
FEIKMAN,1st rule of any game. If you shoot an AI way more times than you should and it is not dying - you turn around and run as fast as you can boi.
Rolo-CoC,This game is absolute fucking trash right now.
seaseme,. Dr. D uninstalls every game. It‚Äôs just a matter of time.
Towel4,"This was acceptable in 2017

That was 6 years ago"
ApprehensiveDamage22,He only landed 2 shots in the legs and one on the vest.
BeefyZealot,This game is shit lmao.
OneBlindMan,Why is this game we play so dogshit?
HecklerK,If I shoot a scav 10 times with good ammo and he doesnt drop I just run away because i know theyre bugged
FloatingRevolver,Who is us? You got a mouse in your pocket?
justlikebart420,Dr Dickhead
Agres_,Trash game. 7 years and counting...
Stxww,This is why this game dying lol
Procol_Being,"If you're defending this kind of AI you're just braindead.. The AI in Call of Duty 2 was smarter than this it's pathetic, especially for a survival/tactical/sim game like this is trying to be.."
MOR187,"I got head eyes from a Makarov scav near old Station yesterday.. started yelling from like 50 m away, , couldn't see him.. one shot.. damn this game"
dahennakin,"I uninstalled some months back after over 1000 hours.. the sound and the cheaters made me quit. I offered Battlestate Games help as I was a professional sound designer and programmer for the gaming industry (sacred and others, 10+ titles) - they never replied. I offered the first day for free!! I lost any hope that this will be fixed. These guys suck!"
jloll1,I cannot wait for this game to die
Paundeu,"The game is a flaming pile of shit.  I swear they troll their customers every wipe just to see how many autists continue playing and worst of all, make excuses."
DickeTitten69,"I‚Äôm surprised he even streams this game. It seems like it is way out his skill and attention span range.

Edit: lol @ the sub that botted this comment"
Tht_GuyUNo,Personal favorite is last year when a scav yelled at him and his response was ‚Äúthe man called me a hamburger‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing
willybum84,Give me back my son!
Mindless-Sentence809,That‚Äôs what shit ammo looks like
viclamota,"This game gonna die, i'm glad i played it enough."
alucard9114,I was thinking of reinstalling this shit game then Doc made me remember!
Luc1fer1,"""Very realistic combat sim"""
xObiJuanKenobix,"Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.  
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).

Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Dr. Disrespect was already dead."
flatspotting,"I hate Dr D and I hate the AI in this game.  Doesnt react to getting shot 5-6 times then just turns around awkwardly, it's so fucking janky."
Scattered699,Looks like a skill issue
KaNesDeath,Everything about this game from a FPS gameplay standpoint doesnt work well.
ITriedLightningTendr,"I dunno about damage, but that seemed like a really sloppy and shitty play"
SilentReavus,Complaining is just kind of his thing no matter what game.
ShitbirdMcDickbird,This dude's whole thing is intentionally creating moments like this so he can bitch about whatever game he's playing.
Yakasha,"I remember this guy. Didn't he used to be famous or something?
Also, I've missed less shots at a dartboard a mile away"
BeThePrawn,I am going to be honest with y'all. This game looks like textbook great concept shit execution. It will never leave beta. Shame.
CaladinDanse,Reminder guys it's just a beta! Years later
Jayowski,"Quite the contrary, he isn't even one of us."
unbelievablymoist,Skill issue
sloshy3,"Drinking game: one shot every time you read a comment that says 'uhh no, I don't cheat on my wife! ü§£'"
JerseyMikeTV,This is one of the reasons I stopped playing Tarkov. Feel like there is a massive amount of desync. It takes me a full clip to kill anything. But I‚Äôm head/eyes‚Äôd with the first bullet out the barrel. Every. Time.
DayZ_Bushman,deinstall that BS of a shitgame....its the biggest cheater sandbox EVER seen in 20 years
Chief_Amiesh,"This game is a joke, and BSG doesn‚Äôt even care what reddit has to say, they‚Äôve covered their ears to us.
How many of us in here enjoyed the game, showed it to a friend, just to have that friend buy the game and experience shooting an entire mag at someone just to end up getting killed in the end and quitting the game because it‚Äôs bullshit. Me? I‚Äôve had about 8 friends quit this game because of a plethora of reasons but this is definitely a big one. Tell me in what universe you get shot at (even if wearing armor) and you just run away like it‚Äôs airsoft? In the Tarkov universe. It‚Äôs bad game design, terrible respect for skill, and just egregious to lose because of something like this. And this is just one problem, there‚Äôs pages on pages of problems that make this game a jarringly-shit gaming experience, which is unfortunate because a lot of us want this game to be good.
Fuck BSG, I‚Äôm done playing until next wipe, even then it‚Äôs still going to be a total joke doing all the quests again, for the 9th time."
osa_ka,fuck that cheating piece of shit
gigamewtwo,Who watches dr dipshit?
The-Grift3r,"No he isn't, I don't cheat on my wife."
dizzy_nixx,This dude has always sucked. Go take some more adderal and ignore your family.
I3epis,"Dr Disrespect isn't me, I wouldn't cheat on my wife."
SenatorCrabHat,Watched in live! Got Tarkoved so hard.
unL_r3m_,This game turning to shit
AverageMetalConsumer,Honestly not a good look for the game.
SquadGotWiped,Imagine thinking this isn't a skill issue.
Fhbob1988,This shit is why I stopped playing
HalfaRavioli,This hasn‚Äôt happened to me the entire wipe.
theteaharvester,Go get'em doc
DrSeuss19,That game is such a pile of shit and every freaken streamer is playing it. It‚Äôs so confusing.
Redditisannoying69,Idc what any of you say the addition of a million ammo and armor types have ruined this stupid fucking game.
AnimeTiddiee,"Haven‚Äôt played since wipe day because of this type of thing, I just don‚Äôt get how a company can consistently make the same problems come back time and time again, and instead of fixing anything they like bandaid it like they did with the rubber banding :T I love the fucking game but I DESPISE the development and the decisions they make like trying to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù a sandbox game. Why?"
Key_Transition_6820,"Its a fucking guard, you cant just leg them like that and expect to get away with it."
higgscribe,Hahhahaha there's a reason I stopped playing this garbage game
Bigdyll13,Dude is a trash ape.
Kaieron,"BSG make a big mistake over the last years, and give this kid a Streamer item, a waste of time and place"
exsciled,You mean hes the 2 time back to back Cheater ?
teddytwelvetoes,lol get this grifter weirdo outta here
Repulsive_Voice823,"He missed quite a bit and just barely got aimpunched out of the headshot, sometimes you get unlucky like that."
TChambers1011,This game simply is not for his play style
FireHawke32,"Still surprises how often we see videos of people shooting scavs that appear to be invincible, and they just stand there shooting at them until the scav shoots back and kills them. Like, what did you expect to happen? After two or three headshots don‚Äôt kill them, dip the fuck out of there lmao. Edit: whoever is downvoting this is the type of person who defends dim ads behavior."
DeadlyLemming,"Hey now, I don't cheat on my wife"
DivineLolis,Nah i dont cheat on my wife
DictatorInPerpetuity,I can't believe people still play this trash
Woahboah,Eh I've seen worse
Posi_Vibes,skill issue
AccountantOk7335,Skill issue
