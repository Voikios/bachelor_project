Uncle_Bobby_B_,Sorry they unbanned you. Welcome back to hell
thecodehermit,"It only took 3 days, 19K + upvotes and the entire Tarkov community talking about your case in order for you to get unbanned. If/ when that happens again to someone else I have no idea how will they get their account fixed."
Newguyiswinning_,"Just a reminder, this isn't the norm. Most people out there will stay banned"
MacaroonSome225,"Right on!

Surprised someone *cough* didn't just buy you a new copy initially"
RespectGiovanni,"Now we need to hear from BSG why this happened. This basically seems to be exactly what the outrage was about, banning just because a streamer asked. No checking logs, stats, etc."
SlaveNumber23,"> I've only killed 39 PMC's in 67 raids-oof)
  
Yeah but one of those was Rengawr, who is so good that only cheaters can kill him!"
Colorado_Gaming,Dude had to create a global movement to get unbanned.  Hopefully this gets the message across that BSG support is atrocious.  Doubt it though.
smartmynz_working,congrats. Was your items and progression restored as well? or just account and level?
hyperpimp,Watch him kill landmark and get banned again within the week.
marniconuke,"Starting a raid should pop up a warning saying if there's a streamer in the same raid and if i want to opt out. 

Jokes aside it's really sad the ammount of people affected by this, luckily you got your account back"
nighteeeeey,"in memories of all the poor fellas whos posts do not go viral and they stay banned because they killed an insecure streamer who has way too much power.

rip in pieces"
Sentinowl,"Glad there was a resolution to this. Huge shame it took so so much though.

But hey, not many people at all can brag that they killed Rengawr!"
SpiteScary1893,Glad to hear it. Good luck!
mayasux,"It’s somewhat sad that a random bought you an account before the person at fault did, but I’m glad all went well for you.

The person at fault absolutely needs repercussions tho."
silenkurii,"Great outcome at the end of the day. Happy to see the ban reversed!

So note to EVERYONE: You have to record ALL of your game play to prove your innocence now."
monotonousgangmember,"Ah yes, so this game is already turning into r/2007scape in the sense that the only way to rectify false bans are to get enough upvotes on Reddit. Nice!"
whoisgare,"Great to hear this wrong has been corrected, hopefully this will spark BSG to work with BattleEye and get other false bans corrected"
bonjajr,Free jeppers
GingerSnapBiscuit,"I fully believe when they say they ""manually check bans"" all they do is check the report, see if its a streamer, and if it is just say ""yeh he's probably right""."
briarknit,Nobody is getting death threats. That's the go-to excuse used to dodge all accountability
MrMortlocke,"The amount of effort you had to go through to get unbanned is a testimony to how trash BSG is. 

When I first purchased this game Xsolla messed up and charged my account 5 extra times and it took me months to get my money back. It was over $500 worth. They claimed it never happened, BSG claimed they didn’t charge me more than once, but clearly my credit union account showed different. 

Within a couple days of getting the disputed charges back into my account I was banned. So I went ahead and disputed that last charge for the game and got ALL my money back. Fuck Xsolla, Fuck BSG. Never touching either of them again. They tried to steal from me and lied about it the entire time."
Madnessx7,u/OnepegMG gained a follower from me through his integrity of this entire situation.
Chindisery,"The fact that something like this can even happen in the first place is downright pathetic. You're spot on with the fact that nothing would of happened if your post didn't get traction.

I'm entirerly convinced that BSG unbanned you to cover their ass, save face. Think of how many other players have been banned in this exact way and have been unable to get their account back.

This is damage control."
Accomplished-Note386,Dude thank god. I stand by my post in saying a Sherpa should never use that power to fuck over someone in the community
Gunvillain,"It's like who is running the show here? BSG or Streamers? The only power streamers should have, is hitting that report button in game if they feel they have been killed by a cheater. That's it.

BSG should learn from this and cut off communications with streamers."
DWotSP4,I honestly thought you would be banned for longer. Glad everything worked out!
NoireResteem,"Really glad for you bro but BSG still need to answer for banning someone just because a streamer told them to. Honestly as much as I do enjoy this game, I hope someone eventually copies the formula and makes something better. BSG really doesn’t deserve our money until they actually treat customers right. Main reason why I refuse to buy any of the expansion stuff."
SeemRa,"Did they say, like sorry or smth? Or how did you find out that you got unbanned?"
en1mal,"Mhm streamers (community content creators) buying new keys themselves for fans of the game they play and stream, giving more money to BSG without resolving the issue at hand..  sounds about right."
WolfHunter1043,"Happy this worked out for you. Did you get a reliable contact? 

I was banned 7 days ago and can’t get any answers. I had submitted 31 tickets prior of that for the game freezing and had many launcher issues. Even reinstalled windows which did help for a few hours but unfortunately freezing came back. Tried many solutions they gave me through the tickets to no avail. 

I have emailed BSG, opened a ticket, emailed BattleEye and nothing. The only response I got was to the ticket which I opened another. It seems to be a generic response about sharing my account which I do not. I play on my desktop and laptop when traveling but I am the sole person that plays. Account is 3 years old. Have two factor on and have had no random requests. 

Only thing I can think that resulted in it, and no way he was a steamer with those tactics, was I saw a guy near scav village on woods lay in a bush near the sniper hill from outside the village. He was watching two people in the village like I was. Me being the rat that I am and needing grenade kills. I crouched and over the next 5-10 minute snuck up on him and threw an impact grenade down on him. Sure as hell he thought I was cheating but he didn’t know the time it took to make it seem like that. 

Stopped playing all together. I won’t rebuy the game if this crap happens. It’s hard enough as is but this brings a new meaning to getting Tarkoved…."
Psychological-Monk30,I'm glad you got unbanned ! But rangawr is still an idiot !
Vissar,"/u/justice_Cx You were asking why it was cringe that you were defending Rengwar. This is why. You're a big fan of injustice, yet you were siding with the unjust side."
Crazy-Turn225,"Glad to hear that, everything ended fine. we will remember youre situation for a long time. And mock on rewangar accaunt , for 1 or 2 month more, then it will happen something else. 

Good luck!"
djmd1,Glad you're unbanned but this kind of bullshit shouldn't even be able to occur in the first place. More amateur hour game development from BSG.
KevitoMG,You love to see it. Keep it up and have a good wipe nontheless!
thexian,"While I'm happy you got unbanned OP, this really points towards a bigger issue. The fact that someone got banned that fast because a streamer submitted the report and then just a few short days later had to unban that player shows that they did absolutely fuck all to verify that you actually were cheating."
BigToasster,Streamers ruin tarkov. Bunch of over entitled cry babies.
Tw2k17,Wait so you killed a popular tarkov streamer and got banned for it yikes another reason why I think streaming has ruined gaming as well as esports
,[removed]
Enverex,"I've reported his Twitch account for malicious conduct and stated that he's trying to get people banned as retaliation for getting killed in games. If he's been repeatedly doing it, may be worth reporting it?"
eda1112111,today's good news
8BitLamb,"Huge win, gratz bro!"
CaptainTKirk,Good news dude
HalfaRavioli,"Welcome back brother, go have some fun!"
Available_Rub834,Good news! Happy for you man :)
Jon_D13,Better keep that dog tag
Particular-Rain9976,Were you emailing support? Also how did you know you got unbanned did you jus randomly check?
Ok-Life8294,Imagine getting unfairly banned and your reddit post complaining about the ban didn't hit the front page.. rip $140
jdiamond31,Finally a good post
FloridaSpam,I don't play the game. But followed this. Glad you got resolution. Bans are great when needed and horrible when unjustified.
AncientRelief9479,"They wouldn't of done this if it hadn't blown up, BSG are still the bad guys, they are just on damage control"
Successful-Body9573,Happened to me in rust. Got banned from rustoria experimental branch during the new recoil update for raiding XQC on the server. Found out the streamers agents had a contract to show off the new rust recoil but the admins had to protect them. Shit gets real sketchy when streamers get involved.
Sanni11,"As suspected, his stream chat is rather controversial currently. I don't think doing nothing and having another streamer do the work to get unbanned then just making a !sorry tag cuts the cake. Rather selfish really... at minimum for the false accusation that would potentially real cost OP his hard earned for that account, the streamer should have their account reset. A cop out for them and a lesson, want to wave your authority around like nothing face the consequences."
zerocooll87,"My son has been fragging entire squads of late repeatedly and I’m starting to worry he will get a false Ban. 
Pretty sad, I gotta worry about that happening. Didn’t help he changed his name to something like iwipedursquad. He’s just a kid. 

Glad you got your account back!"
MrKushBagz,The streamer needs banned for 3 days. Causing other people to be banned cause they died with quest items shouldn't be allowed
jdeegz502,Good for you. You’re like a legend now that will forever be attached to tarkov lore.
Ioqua,"So this is the bit where BSG should be public and say exactly why he was banned and then unbanned and what they are going to do. If one was wrong how many others are wrong?

How many people have had up to an EOD worth of account stolen from them by BSG because they have incompetent policies/rogue staff and itchy trigger fingers."
Solaratov,"It's great you were unbanned, despite what *certain users* say and do on this sub, making a post about being falsely banned **CLEARLY WORKS** in getting a meaningful response from BSG."
Maleficent_Hat4905,getting banned with almost 1 pmc kill every other match.l is dumb. they shouldn't of even considered it.
fra_fra_fra_,This guy and his mods are very rude and confirm the fact that streamers have more power over normal players
ThatKPerson,"Look at this ""apology"": https://twitter.com/RengawrLoL/status/1614202180373995520

Unban everyone he's reported and take the ability for him to report away."
AbovexBeyond,Hot take: he who must not be named should’ve bought you an EoD license.
AbovexBeyond,Welcome back to this shit hole :)
zXerge,"Really happy for you,  big win. Fucking gross that streamer(s) have the ability to make this  happen to begin with."
DogFartsonMe,Absolutely insane this game bans people at the beck and call of a streamer.
thegibsterr,W
TarkovReddit0r,You truly can't escape Tarkov. Welcome back to hell!
SuperToxin,Time to get your face kicked in!
Ttrip66,It's because you're a bear

Smoerble,"That's great, to am happy for you. I just wish bag changes this stupid policy"
Kedward8907,Hell yea dude glad to hear it.
BetFit2122,👏
ElegantEpitome,"Great work getting unbanned! However, you’re wearing the same outfit as my PMC, and I’m gonna have to ask you to change it or I’ll use my connections to get you banned again… I can’t have any imposters"
Tex302,Justice!!
Udosari,GG.
Firecracker048,39 PMCs in 67 raids is pretty damn good
Event82Horizon,"Wtf man you successfully Escaped Tarkov and now you are back?! Whats wrong with you! 

&#x200B;

Welcome back bro :)"
caffeine_man,Welcome back to Tarkov! I am glad everything turned out well in the end and I wish you good luck on your raids.
Jenkies2459,I have the same issue like you right now just waiting for BSG to response to get unbanned 🙃🙃🙂
bdoproc,"Its a shame that innocent people are getting banned, and the massive amount of obvious cheaters are going around unbanned. Glad you got out of jail though."
Alarmed_Presence_814,"I was falsely banned, didn't create a nicely written reddit post. Whenever I tried to contact BSG, I got an auto response. Shit company, great game unfortunately."
vdubman69,"Dude you escaped lol geuss you like being in the shit na thats good it jas been fixed welcome back bud, of you kill me hide my stuff thanks man. Littledrymuffin"
snorkelbed,"Only took a decent community uproar, returning to regularly scheduled bullshit. Glad to hear you got unbanned op."
LELO_TV,"Woah also the alpha armband, that's not something you'd recover with a new account"
sweeper_agent67,imagine escaping from Tarkov and they drag you back in 😭😭😭
_____l,"For some reason this post makes me want to try the game, rather than steer away from it.  Hmm...I have been looking for something new."
PureRushPwneD,"Congratulations, at least there's *some* hope for legit players being yeeted. Not holding my breath though :/"
bondbuyingbandosboi,"Level and stats restored? or is that pre-ban screenshot? Stash restored too? Normally if you're unbanned its level 1 and default stash again. 

Great news you're unbanned, I hope some positive changes are made by BSG and Battle eye but I doubt it. With those 2 devs banning that guy and unbanning him last month after all the bad press too, some serious issues here on top of the audio, cheating, performance, recoil and desync"
Sleexic,I’ve got about 8 pmc kills in like 35 raids. I can’t compete with other plays so I actively avoid them. Y’all out here with a high pmc kdr?
Professional_Feed322,"So it this post didn't take off on reddit, nothing would have happened. Basically that means there is hundreds if not thousands of other players out there who got handed the same BS, but have no way of fighting it"
JunkyBoiOW,happy for you dude i’m glad it came down to this and you got your account back. kind of ridiculous how BSG doesn’t communicate anything about this they just let their community run rampant lol
arct1ccz,Glad to hear the reddit campaign had an effect man! Too bad BSG never commented on anything xD
Alone_Manufacturer66,The only justice in all of Tarkov
Synchrotr0n,"As usual, the whole bunch of Tarkov Stans who claimed that BSG banned a player because they manually reviewed the report and detected cheating were full of shit. I'm really glad I play in South America and I'm so bad at the game that I can only kill PMCs who are AFK, so the likelihood of me getting summarily banned for killing a streamer is extremely small."
Phantom7835,Just be glad your post didn't get deleted like most do - congratulations man!
Ill-Hold7546,i also got banned when killing a streamer. unfortunately their egos dictate that if they lose more than once in an hour they contact battleeye the minute it happens. GL to everyone undergoing this i really hope we all get some justice
RE1EAZ,"Nice to hear you are unbanned! 

  
But fuck this company lmao, Support = auto messages.   
They even BLOCK people for 60days without a decent fucking reason. Wich happened to a friend. I can still play.  


I hope BSG responds to this and gives a good explanation.   
They look like a fucking joke on so many aspects lmao.   


Welcome back to hell brother"
AmargoTV,Yooooo what a great community! Yall are amazing for supporting !!
RogueMage7,the good ending
nsfwITGUY19,"Really happy you were unbanned. Sucks that it happened but at least it brought more awareness to some key issues with BSG and streamers. 

Hopefully Rengawr learned something as well. Though I see he went from apologizing to playing the victim card because “people on the internet were being mean”"
MrGhost94,Aye !!!nice man .back to the grind
TyraelmxMKIII,finally! but still no statement from bsg themselves! Glad you got access again!
testthetemp,"Fuck BSG, any company that just straight up bans because an average Joe killed a streamer and they cried about it, doesn't deserved your time and definitely not your money. Let the game and BSG fade into obscurity."
cyberbuns,"congratulations man, sorry this whole thing happened. Really makes me dislike Rengawr for the way he treated you."
skrubzei,u/OnepegMG just seems like such a good guy.
earthly_leopard,Tbf a 4 kd isn't even remotely sus. There are hackers running out there in the wild with a way higher k/d. Why they don't do bans based off stats is beyond me. It would really cull the issue a lot.
ElWati,Congratz buddy!
dr69ons6mur6i,Maybe if streamers don’t want to be killed on stream they should cover their map. Or maybe only play with other streamers. Blaming random players and getting them banned simply because someone killed you is a shitty childish move. That streamer that complained to the devs to get you banned is a little bitch. Same to anyone else that does that.
Santa_Claus77,Fuck the streamers and EFT
hatmatattack,"I'm really happy the community came together and bought you the game again, but I can't help but be mad about it as well because BSG's shitty behaviour just got rewarded for it."
fr33Wi11y72,It’s funny the mods rushed in to lock that post to stop people from talking trash
Chicho_Procer,"Streamers and being fucking crybabies, a more traditional combo than a burger and fries"
DarthSkath,Still not okay for a Sherpa Streamer to act the way he did and then flaunt the money he makes and acts like his contract doesn’t matter because he has money
TimmeTehWise,"Yeah it's great your back, and it seems like Rengawr was at least somewhat sorry, I don't watch him so I don't really know much about this aside from his vid and twitlogger, but this hasn't fixed the actual problem. 

There are still people who have been banned unfairly and the servers are so messed up that you can get false banned, yet it looks like a legitimate ban. I'm just going to take a break from this game, probably for at least a year or 2 until either their support team or dev team can get to a point where I can at least rely on being able to get my account back after a false ban. 

I understand that this is a beta but if I can lose the account I paid 100$+ for because of some bug; I think it's just better to wait until it's a more stable product. I'm just hoping that eventually it will actually be a stable product, as the performance has only been getting worse over the years."
Guilty_Fishing8229,"Welcome back. Now you can use this subreddit for what it was made for: complaining about audio issues, optimization and desync"
kym111,Lesson learned: always voip first asking if the person you about to shoot is a big twitch streamer or not. /s
28022006,i’ve only killed 8 PMCs in like 50+ raids
Proudestpan,WE FUCKIN DID IT!
SuperRektT,"happy to read, enjoy"
MOR187,"so, if it wasn't about you going to reddit or if you would have been shot before being able to loot the man child, you're money would be gone now..?"
SlavicArab,There is no escaping from tarkov...
Mojo-X,"Nice, I hope that BSG or some streamers have learned something from this. Would not like to know how many are banned because of desync or some other server bug shit"
Mikkelzen,Lmao how tf are we supposed to know??? What's the next thing gonna be? YOU KILLED A SCAV THAT A STREAMER HAD IN HIS SIGHTS
Febraiz,"Finally, something is right in this world. Still waiting for the streamers to get their ban power/direct line with BSG removed tho."
Triplekarme,"Thanks for keeping us updated, I used to easily press the report button everytime someone was sus, this all thing definitely taught me to be more reasonable and not doing it so much. Good raids to you!"
EmotionalOrUnstable,You gave tarkov the biggest Stir-up I've seen since release (see what I did there) good to have you back soldier
momentslove,"We need a Casual Lives Matter movement, seriously"
o266537,"This ban should never happen. Pro streamer encouraged me to one thing - ignore EfT on Steam. I was observing this game for quite a time, considered purchase, but not anymore."
ZaneBoettcher,"One of the reasons I can’t continue to play. To many false bans, and streamers questioning their death every time they die. “Oh this guy had a nice name to prove it too, trust me chat”. They also forget rounds can fragment to and cause multiple hits to one area, but they’ll say that someone is aim botting because X amount of hits to an area. 

I really enjoyed this game, but the lack of care for the player base and the toxic streamers ruin the fun. I’ll just keep watching on twitch, and stay logged off."
12inches4you,Fck Streamers!
cykelskur,Good thing you got unbanned - but it’s quite scary how little evidence it took to get you banned 😬
swagsauce3,BSG is a fucking joke
StudMuffin0219_2,"Welp, another reason to not play the game this wipe"
Serious-Squirrel-220,"Looking at Rengawr's footage of it, it doesn't even look like cheating anyway. Obvious desync issue. Maybe streamers don't notice it so much with the high end rig, but still.
I think half the player base is cheating in some way tbh, but it's rare to see something blatantly obvious enough to report."
self_loathing_ham,">(Just so you know, that KD includes scavs. I've only killed 39 PMC's in 67 raids-oof)

Wait is.... Is that bad?...."
KevinDL,"As a game developer, this is a vast overreach problem for the studio if streamers influence bans.  It shouldn't happen, and now they are stuck in a position where they potentially have to unban everyone to bring justice to the few that may have been innocent.  The game has a considerable cheating problem, but they must start from scratch if their banning system needs to be fixed."
kissgyorgy,They managed to ban the only person who was not cheating LOL
FilthyPeasant_Red,"I'll say it again, and like Onepeg noted in his last videos, Almost all streamers have a direct line of communication with BSG, but they were told that a direct report to them was still going to be processed by battle-eye. This story showed that some people at BSG have too much power. Not the streamers.

ANYONE with a brain at BSG should have seen that account with those stats and paused for a second to think. 

Rengawr had a sus death, it happens.  He had all the rights to report it and if someone has a way to quicken a cheater's ban then I don't mind it at all. 

What pisses me off is that too many unqualified people at BSG have access to a ban button when in all honesty, very few should have that access. That person should have forwarded that info to BattleEye and let it go through regular process."
Duderus9,Hell yeah dude. You’re a good guy and I’m glad it worked out. FYI I think you were way too nice to rengawr for this. Dude is a man child and needs to be held accountable for acting as such.
Grim_Game,Been making a point to comment on rengawrs shit where I can making fun of him. Glad to see a bunch of you guys are also doing the same. Fight the good fight
justice_Cx,Great to hear and hopefully they will improve the system ASAP.
atled6,0.5 PMCs per raid isn’t bad man. Most people are below that
Stock-Chemist6872,"Great way to kill your game instantly.  
Make protected group of people that will be standing above everybody else and make sure that if they are killed by somebody person will get banned. Good thinking BSG it literally cannot be worse. So it's not only that your game have tons of hackers now we have protected species called streamers... what next ? Will you remove everybody who have standard edition because they didn't paid enough ? Like common guys wake up."
ZurdoFTW,This is why I stopped playing.
Rdtadmscksdnkydk,"Kinda disappointed the streamer said ""all I did was report him"" the next day, when he clearly says he's going to get you banned."
SupportAndy123,"Rengawr is such a good player, he could be an even bigger streamer if he wasn't such an asshat. Idk what it is with American Tarkov streamers, 90% of them are unwatchable to me"
accuracy_frosty,"I have to say, you’re lucky this got so much attention, you would not have been unbanned otherwise, BSG would not have cared"
SeparateAddress9070,"Killing streamers isn't the problem, it seems like the particular streamer in mind should lose his credibility though."
Silenthonker,"u/TripleOyimmy I rest my case lmao  
u/definitelynotdepart I also rest my case, BSG clearly did fuck all about verifying the clip"
Donsen420,"Nice work, bitch!"
definitelynotdepart,"I was hesitant to directly believe you due to how many cheaters have come here with sob stories in the past, but the fact BSG would just ban based off of a report is disgusting. 

I stand by thinking streamers and high profile players should have a line to BSG, I do not put the blame on them for sending reports. BSG is fully to blame for being so incompetent that they don't review the bans they hand out at all.

I wouldn't be surprised if they just ban on reports from the launcher without a review too, I've seen some accounts disappear after I use that."
noahsark02,He said sorry though (after not being sorry and being a dick and getting you banned in the first place and whining all over Twitter about no regret) so that’s cool right ?
Iteroparous,Glad to hear.
book-cat,"Nothing makes me want to play a game that I'm gonna have to basically sink my life into to get good at like the threat of getting a one off good kill and losing my account as a consequence,

I'm glad they made it right."
TigerXG,"Do they actually straight-up ban people for killing streamers? I haven't touched the game for a while but when I did play (like 6 months ago) I killed some PMC who might have been a streamer (I don't know the community that well) and my account is banned, as I recently tried to play again."
autismo-nismo,"I still think after all this there is a huge issue.

Glad you are back.

BSG and streamers didn’t even attempt to properly investigate and determine if a cheat was used. They just immediately went straight to the hammer.

Meanwhile you have dudes who have a insane flea market rep and dozens of duplicate extremely rare loot items. I need a LEDX to craft my med station, there’s a dude on flea market right now that had 30 LEDx that I’ve been seeing for a week with a 60+ flea rep. Yet that player remains active without batting an eye. Instead of using a reliable anti cheat or investigating your gameplay. They just said “fuck it, he’s banned.”

I’m only playing because I already bought the game. But I tell my friends who have contemplated it that it’s not really worth it."
Dapper_Beginning3591,"Firm handshakes on the community and you getting your account back! Congrats on the W. 

Now let’s not lay down our pitchforks and hopefully BSG acknowledge this as a fuck-up and take away the power from (certain) streamers."
Wisest-wizard,"Onepeg seems like a cool dude, great content. Not familiar with Jinx though, might have to check them out if they make youtube videos."
sniperhare,Hoe would you even know you're shooting a streamer?
DickeTitten69,"Uh oh mods already out here removing shit from the thread. 

Inb4 the lock."
somethingtolose,Streamers and twitch in general is such a plague on gaming as a whole.  Glad you got unbanned big dog.
restless_oblivion,And like an idiot you go back to playing. Lol
Teddie-Bonkers,BSG's streamer obsession in action. I complained that some streamers appeared to be getting preference on qeues one wipe days and got downvoted to hell. Looks like they are willing to do whatever it takes to protect their golden geese.
bmstrrrr,Beautiful.
RespectGiovanni,39 pmcs in 67 raids is good
exmortom,"I wonder how many Ukrainians have been banned, after the start of the war.?"
Trione787,Grats!... Maybe rengawr can stop getting death threats now. And the clown show from this community will end :D
FriendlyInChernarus,"OP should get an item in game lmao, also, fuck rengawr."
BlakeTx666,Yawn. Clout chasing.
stunted,"Let's be honest, Rengawr fucked up but not bad enough to warrant the response some of you assholes gave him, death threats? Come the fuck on. Onepeg is a drama frog farming content though and should have never made that video. Weird and cringe."
kekbab,"> I've only killed 39 PMC's in 67 raids-oof)

streamer kills have a triple reward multiplier, developers have a 10x. the higher the risk of you getting banned the higher the reward"
WorldlyDivide8986,"Tldr on how did you eventually get unbanned? 

I kinda suck so I barely kill but if my luck will show me it's rectum one day and I'll get the same happening for me, what can I do?"
lightlumina,"meanwhile i got banned for 60 days today without knowing the reason, dont even 

play that good :I"
encinitas2252,Did the streamer you killed comment on this?
Wirley,"This literally happened to me last wipe, banned in the second week and had to buy a new account. Ban error 229 as well for indication of a manual ban"
Mountain_Salt3613,To me this translates to: Don’t play the game if you want to keep your account. Nice
jo3roe0905,You escaped though….
dimsumdonair2,Careful others may say they got banned for the same reason however I'm skeptical that it could be cheaters asking for an appeal
ekohzzz,Him and Light keeper are the only ones to escape Tarkov and come back.
jd52995,Did you get to keep your level and all your gear from this wipe?
Didki_,"Sooo here's the thing, This confirms two things:

1. He was innocent
2. He was banned in error because BSG did not take the time to view the situation through whatever logs they have if any and simply trusted the clip submitted by rengawr.

I am very happy he was unbanned but this practically proves our speculations until now, the ""ban this guy"" channel provided to streamers comes with very few strings and restrictions attached. There was no investigation, it's dubious to assume BSG even looked at the clip before pressing the ban button, this is very concerning.

How many players were banned this way because x streamer with lvndmark syndrome had a temper tantrum like Rengawr did? This is not okay and we should not let things lie until an actual statement and apology from BSG is issued."
ZodiacKnight117,Can’t stress it enough- record your gameplay if you can
Entrical,Damn this happened a WoW Classic as well when a shithead streamer raged and told his gm buddy to ban someone. Glad you got this handled but fuck that streamer and fuck the gm that acquiesced his request. Streamer should be banned and gm should be fired.
HyDa_Scarface2,"I know BSG is trying to combat cheaters, but relying on streamers who can report people just because they get butt hurt over getting killed. there definitely should be other checks and I hope they fix it from this day forward. Reng absolutely knew you were going to get banned. In his follow-up video, he tried to blame BSG instead of manning up and saying he fucked up. (he knew they would ban you)"
Negative_Resident_37,“Return to Tarkov”
