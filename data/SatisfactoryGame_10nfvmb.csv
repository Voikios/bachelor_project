liferlanceSD,"Totally unrelated, but inspired by this thread:
I was raving to my girlfriend about how nice and encouraging everyone is on here and some of the scale modeling reddits I follow. 
She responded with: How sad is that? You're blown away and raving about people just being nice to each other online."

fredsshed,This is one of the reasons why I wanna get this game… the building aspects are infinite… alas I neither have a device that can harbor such luxurious and humongous structures… or the game itself to even begin my journey… one day though I will reach that pinnacle and join all of you…
