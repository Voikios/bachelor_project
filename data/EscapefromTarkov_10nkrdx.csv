Conduit3,"Honestly bro cherish these things, you won't realize how much it means to you until 15 years later and you're both grown up."
Throwadudeson,This needs to be framed. Also shared on the wiki maps
Donsen420,Don't show this to Therapist.
2-Skinny,"My daughter (six at the time) did the same once.  Ten minutes later, she's walking around the house with her nerf guns and a duffle bag looking for loot."
izzzi,Twist: his brother is 32.
BalazsLevente,"So backstory. My cousin is 6 yrs old. He's not suposed to look at any violent stuff, but since he just came back from his country for a few days, i've decided to show him some cool stuff. I've shown him cbum, we worked out together and then i explained him the tarkov lore."
Narsku1001,Shooting nerf darts...
G-Fluff, This is the after raid report everyone was asking for.
Swampxdog,"Bahaha I remember being at a doctors waiting room with my mom and brother. The day before I sat next to my brother watching him play Duke Nukem 3d on our old computer. They had crayons and paper in this waiting room, so I drew Duke tearing aliens apart; even had a stipper up in the corner. I had to be like 6, and my bro was 12, I think. I took it to my brother and he grabbed it and hurriedly hid it in his pocket and was like, ""Dude don't let mom see that shit. It's cool though.""

Great memory. Miss my brother. Thanks for showing, man."
Tommypaura,Time to bring him in raid
Bradur-iwnl-,"As long as you and your parents handle this well this wont be a problem but a cherished moment. Or thats how i interpreted the post, your mother (probably) not liking this xd.

hook him on peaceful minecraft!"
AleexTB,That's super cute omg
goonwill,Best map Iâ€™ve seen
cheated_in_math,"Hold onto this for the rest of your life, it will bring you great joy later"
Frosty252,"is this the interchange in game map from therapist?

pretty fuckin well drawn holy shit."
ConstantCarnage,Is there a way we can swap out the wiki Interchange map with this one? This map is a lot more informative with how much of a joke this game has become in the last two years
Kindly-Mine-1326,I remeber when i drew corpses for my dad. Lovely.
Esteozeka,"Idk but it seems your brother is way too young watching you play a game like Tarkov.    
But I've seen you mentioned that he's not supposed to see stuff like that so yeah you already know."
misfitinnit,We need more art
Neo14515,Keep them safe and take a look in a few years. Time flies by faster then we think
timmmmehh,"You better never throw this away. Keep this safe, itâ€™s a prized possession. Youâ€™ll thank me in 20 years from now."
Harley441,"Ohhh now I know where idea is! Tell him thanks for the help, better than any guides Iâ€™ve seen!"
AchokingVictim,Please keep that forever
EaterOfFungus,i like how the only example of a bullet he can think of is a nerf gun dart
BooBooLiciousNess,"Little chad in the making, loved these moment's with my little bros"
trutch70,I hope you got him some fucking ice cream! This is so cute
Runswithtoast,I love that his bullets are NERF bullets!
xFreiSx,That's some good drawing from brother! He got the inspiration and nailed it ðŸ‘Œ
BukLauFinancial,"My first reaction is that a child who's young enough to make a drawing like this shouldn't be watching games like tarkov. I'm not some bleeding heart liberal but I do think that exposure to violence at an early age isn't good for the mental growth of children.

Now, if your brother's 16 and just draws like a mong then that's another story lmao"
Doedel51,"Puhh, dude. You do you and all that jazz but I personally think that there's better things to show to a young child. I've seen those kinds of drawings once on the internet. But they were done by a child living in an active warzone...

I think this belongs more on r/tifu"
Crispyskips728,Cherish that shit forever my friend. Rarest drop in tarky
lyallmartin1,Your brother gonna grow up to be like Landmark one day
El-Carone-707,Layout isnâ€™t perfect but heâ€™s embodied the spirit which is so much more important
atlasthefirst,"maybe, just maybe think about your brother beeing a little bit too young for a game like that? Maybe I'm just European but I don't feel like kids drawings should involve dead people bleeding from bullet holes."
BrannonR,Ya know I think a picture of the picture might be a little better than this short video
pti4ka1488,Is this a Smurf penis with an orange tip (asking for a friend)
CorvusEffect,"""Incredible! Nice work, Bitch!"""
Thwarto,Your brother is dope
LustyArgonianIronman,I like the little pats
BHT_HellaYella,God I wish I didnâ€™t have a shit brother ðŸ¥¹
Chef_Meow,Thatâ€™s kills in the middle
