{"Title": "Scav Factory is basically Among Us", "Post Text": "As the topic states - have you guys noticed that when you enter factory, and hear shots somewhere (usually office or gate 3) the game basically turns into a Tarkov version of Among Us? \n\nYou do not know who shot first, who was defending themselves, who is the traitor and who is the victim.. \n\nEven when you witness the whole interaction and kill an obvious traitor, there is a risk that a 3rd party comes in and decides you must have just murdered an innocent scav... \n\nSo what do you do? Avoid the shots and extract or play the Tarkov edition Among Us?", "ID": "10rnd4o", "Score": 1862, "Total Comments": 291, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/10rnd4o/scav_factory_is_basically_among_us/"}
