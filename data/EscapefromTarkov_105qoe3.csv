eXmina,"The sound is completely broken that's why even sneaking is impossible without other people hearing you through 4 walls, it's so bad.   
It's actually embarrassing how bad the sound is in this game."
orange1911,The amount of times I’ve heard someone voip “i can hear you sneaking around” has made me given up. Why sneak when they can hear me and easily rush? I speed walk at all times now.
waFFLEz_,"Sneaking should be quietest by walking as slow as possible. 

Crouch walking shouldn't be the quietest imo"
Selky,"The problem with sneaking is that when two people are already wary and have stopped moving, ANY volume of footstep is enough.

For a “slow and tactical” game the implications of this are really annoying. Together with the netcode your best bet is to sprint up to an enemy and prefire them with peakers advantage. Even if you can’t prefire due to lack of info, you should have a decent headstart on finding them before they can react."
Infiltrator,"You're right it's so embarassing how the game handles audio. I just popped a guy in the head who was trying to be sneaky. He was crouch walking for 5 min in the grass and I heard him from like 20m. Just sat motionless waiting on him to finally show his face so I could one-tap him. Felt bad for him, becasue I definitely should NOT be able to hear someone going that slow in grass from across the fucking street."
ThatGuySunnyy,"trying to play interchange this patch is AWFUL. Interchange audio has always not been the greatest, but now you can hear people through floors perfectly. I'm not saying there should be no noise between floors, but it shouldn't be as loud as if they were literally walking into you. Combine this with the layout of the interior of interchange, and the lack of stealth options, it feels awful."

AllYouNeedIsLove69,Ebrace the shift + w... because of desync you are way better off then trying to be sneaky. Its sad but that is how it is.
KamikazeAlpaca1,It’s quieter to sneak walk than sneak crouch now
Lenevov,"I’m pretty sure it’s a bug because if I remember there was a wipe that it was like this and then they fixed it. My memory is pretty bad so I don’t know. I miss sneaking tho, it’s how I did well against groups of players as a solo."
SilentReavus,Yeah it's fucking ridiculous that I can hear some poor bastard creeping as slow as he can 20 feet away through a rock.
PeregrineT,"I dont think its because they made any intended change to sneaking, I think its because they messed up the audio so bad that EVERYTHING is way louder.  That includes sneaking.  I used to kill a lot of players because I would walk on a map while they would come sprinting up to me.  Id hear them well before they would hear me without even sneaking and get the drop on them.  Now its all too loud."
InterlopedLooper,"I swear to god so many problems would be resolved in this game if they just removed headphones as an item. No more balancing 8 different sound profiles instead of one, no more grass sounding as loud as stepping on a pile of candy wrappers, no more hearing people with 15lbs of gear sneak at the slowest possible speed, etc etc"
FilthyPeasant_Red,I'm 99% convinced this is a bug and not intended.
rejuicekeve,"dont worry if i put a headset on irl i can hear you take a shit in china and name the exact lat, long"
ProbableIdiot,"What, you don't like being heard from 200 meters away while slow walking?

The entire game's audio needs reworked. It can't keep going on like this."
ShaddyDaShadow,"Please allow us to be sneaky again period, with the new audio im pretty sure its bugged."
Rimbaldo,"It made solo play even less desirable, because as soon as somebody in a squad hears you you're basically fucked now. I used to rely on holding still and letting them pass but can't really do that anymore unless you're lucky enough to be in a hiding spot when they blunder into audio range."
deadlygaming11,"Sound is one of the big things that pisses me off so much with this piece of shit game generally. 

Slow crouch walking with barely anything on? A guy through multiple walls will hear me and know I'm there. Headphones basically give everyone super hearing to the point that without them you are at a disadvantage which isn't fair.

This game has no option of quietly sneaking around and killing or looting because everything is either so loud that everyone can you hear you or desync causes you to lose a fight due to not being able to react quick enough.


This game just has too many issues to actually be fun in my opinion. Recoil is shit to the point that its incredibly awkward to use guns that aren't fully upgraded with different parts, sound is too extreme, the desync can make combat incredibly one sided, and the game is basically not worth playing anytime outside of the beginning of wipes because ingame skills, player skills, and player gear basically make it near impossible to win against someone else who has spent more time which sadly pushes out all but a few of the the possible players because most people have jobs and lives which restricts how much they can play.

For a game that should be about slowly moving, looting and killing people, it fails so badly at those. The game is all about charging at the enemy because actually waiting and strategising isn't an option."
rauldzmartin,There should be an entire patch+wipe dedicated only to a deep sound system rework.
jzwrust,"Yea if anything players should be able to move around more quietly than before.

There were certain materials that were just unreasonably loud when sneaking like metal and wood. 

I feel like it should drain more stamina, but be nearly dead silent."
Nokami93,It's just stupid to even lose the one advantage a solo player has.
attomsk,Bush Wookies are crazy right now because bush audio randomly doesn’t work
ratcrash55,i still dont understand why i have to crab to be quiet. walking quietly standing is infinitely easier than crabbing around.
muatdks,"Bsg has clearly stopped caring about anything that won’t make the game more appealing (maps, guns, etc) they only thing they’ve been doing for years now is just doing band aid fixes instead of actually taking caring of these game breaking issues for good. No profit incentive in fixing bugs."
samwelches,No I agree with this one. The ability to be stealthy via creep walking has been gone for a few wipes now. Kinda sucks
SacksofWine,"I'm not sure if it was a wall hacker or precisely what you're saying but I do remember a time on streets that I heard a team sprinting. I sat in a corner of a building with two points of entry. I would only turn left or right, wasn't moving. Dude slow crouched til he hit the corner, peaked, head eyes with 2 shots. I'm fairly certain it was hacks as he was quite a distance away when I was trying to just chill out but if just turning is loud enough for someone to hunt me down then its all dumb."
Sazbadashie,I agree personally I would like some ammount of stealth
Spomo,"What you probably actually want to ask for is:

""Please let the covert movement skill level faster""

A few wipes ago they changed sound and a few other things and this includes sneaking but was supposed to be covered with covert movement skill. However given that it's easier to sprint around and hear people with low skill(character skills, not player) and keep leveling your endurance etc it feels impossible to actually level this skill because it's not actually quiet.

If the skill is supposed to truly work it should level quickly from let's say 1-10 where it gives a benefit at 10 that is rather quiet.

EDIT: clarification"
BeejsterTTV,Nah fuck them rats
donga123,"i hope they fix the sound and keep it forever that u cant sneak and be a ninja, u can see all the rats have a meltdown cuz they cant rat like they used to"
TLT4,"Yes let me be a rat, love to fucking scare people. Kinda also love it to get scared."
Denekith,"This Game always have problems, Even when they fix they broken again."
Cr1t1cal_Hazard,"Yeah I'd wish we could be more quiet. As soon as you hear someone else, you basically have to take your hands off your keyboard and mouse or else they'll hear you.

Also, the noise from laying down and getting back up is almost as noisy as doing a single-step run"
Newguyiswinning_,"The problem is stats. It always has been. But since they heavily favor streamers, BSG will never take them out because streamers make BSG money"
Cold_Technician_9173,"Imo, sneaking shouldn’t mean you should be completely silent when crouch walking near someone. The reality is when hunting any animal including humans that they are perceptive and can sense others from very long ranges, using both sight and sound. Consider a stealthy play style being positional, strategic, and at long range, rather than quiet. A true stealthy play style is defined by a perfect shot while being unseen or heard of, which requires strategic positioning and timing."
Kboehm,I feel like with he currently state of the audio this is gonna take a backseat
ChillsTV,The game just had really bad sound design
clappen,"Honestly the best thing to do is to play like the pro gamers on twitch, just play aggressive and push. Due to the netcode and the broken sounds, you will often win the gunfights if you initiate them."
beans_lel,Your first mistake was assuming that sound isn't broken beyond repair.
PureRushPwneD,Sneaking even when overweight should be quiet. Why waste all my time and stamina if my character is an elephant?? Especially if I have to climb a 10cm tall thing and jump extremely loudly..same goes fricking every sound your character makes like aiming...
Solid-Boss,This.
richard31693,"I really wish that movement was a touch more realistic. And what I mean by that is that walking with your speed all the way down should be the quietest and crouch-walking and slow crawling slightly louder. But right now even with nothing but a headset on, you still sound loud as hell when doing anything slowly. I'm confident this isn't supposed to be this way and that it'll be fixed *eventually.*"
uphighkid,Noise compression makes this problem much worse. I can walk around and do my thing all I want and I'll hear someone a mile away crawling loud and clear with my own banging or shooting being just as loud as that. I certainly shouldn't be able to. Made worse by the fact that the absolute quietest of sounds have a minimum volume that makes it very clearly audible no matter how quiet it's intended to be.
Janitor_,level up perception :)
k1dsmoke,"I'll say what've said before, and I know it's unpopular, but removing Headsets from the game in combination with a full rework of sound would make this game better to play, even if real suppression headsets exist for shooting.

Sound is one thing that should be consistent across all a players.

Being within 50 meters, 20 meters, 10 meters, 5 meters should all sound the same regardless.

The sound in the game actually *feels* so much better on a Scav with no headset.

Last Shoreline I was in me and a buddy hear a guy running, it SOUNDS like he is right next to us just over the fence line, he even tagged some of the swamp water.

He wasn't right next to us, he was 25 meters out on the OTHER side of the pond/swamp area. We still killed him, but no other game does sound function like this and a big part of it is the ability for headsets to increase the range of your hearing dramatically."
Cptnslapah0e,"My fighting tactics in game has evolved around this. 
I win a lot of fights by walking, hearing someone sprinting or louder than me, I crouch, plant, and wait for them to transit."
Noox89,Only time I’m under weight is if I bring nothing in or maybe a pistol with limited mags
NotARealDeveloper,"How hard is it to put a sphere around each sound source and make it go from 100% in the center to 50% at the corner (because going quieter will just make everyone turn up the volume and kill our ears).

And if a hard wall is obstructing the path to the center, just play the same sound but muffled. 

Super basic sound system and still 10000x better than what we have now..."
Z0EBZ,"Another comment saying that the sound sucks, and they need to prioritize fixing the sound and getting a stable system for it. For all maps. For all players. No, we don't need more maps that won't work, more features that we aren't sure if it's a feature or a bug because nobody tells us anything. We have a good game, a great one. Now we need a polished great game, that focuses on fixing issues, and not adding more ""content"" that has issues with it."
Malador25,Id gladly take steam audio back over this bullshit
Sun743,no more point in leveling covert movement :( no more magnum ninjas
hiddencamela,"The only point of sneaking now, is to reduce the radius you can be heard. If anyone is in that radius, you might as well be sprinting cause its the same fucking volume.  
Someone creep walking is just as loud as someone walk/running if you're in the proper hearing radius. Just defeats the fucking purpose when AI scavs can do it silently, but we can't anymore."
Geksface,They should do an event where there are no footsteps at all. It would be a different game
StealthCatUK,"You know what the solution is to make them do something about it, but you won't do it. It involves uninstalling the game, player count needs to drop sharp. Nothing will make them move faster than this."
garack666,No
FuriousBadgers,"Allowing sneaking is bad, but now everyone can be heard from so far away if you get lucky and you are stood still and hear steps. That player making those steps is so fucked he doesn't even realise it. You just go full rat and he is doomed. Sound is so bad its almost like you cant play chad shift w or sneak. How the fuck they have achieved that i dont know."
CashPuzzleheaded8622,"yeah this wipe there is pretty much only one option: balls 2 the wall (but expecting to get killed by a cheater)

people are always gonna know where you are now so you pretty much have no choice but to get to them before they get to you. or literally sit still like a statue in a spot where they won't find you until they're 200m away. i don't like it either :( they've really exterminated the rat lifestyle this wipe

i was originally gonna skip this wipe but i'm just kinda fucking around and not caring about my progression and it's a lot more bearable. i do not care if i max anything out or even get above level 30"
ZygoteProducer,"You can sneak quietly but you have to be under weight where it’s not yellow, walk speed zero, crouched and not on wood or other crunchy/metallic surface. I’ve taken off my bag and thrown my armor on the ground in dorms just to sneak up on people. It works, you can be fully geared just make sure you’re under weight and know how to sneak."
SchoolPitiful5504,"Just the ""beta"" things"
M-Gnarles,"I kinda like not being able to sneak actually.

Sound is bad, but no silent sneaking means people know when there are hostiles close by and can begin to fight without it being a rat fest"
BigShrekDaddy69,Crybaby central in this subbreddit holy
JuiciestCorn,"Nah man fuck that, game doesn’t need to promote ratting this wipe. First wipe in three wipes that pressing your W key actually doesn’t punish you. Chads need some time to shine too."
ZTK42,"Oh, man. You know, when I throw on a pack that weighs 20kg on top of my already heavy gear, I sure do be movin' quiet as a mouse. 🤨"
Win_98SE," He can’t hear you, he sees you with his hacks."
WiggleRespecter,rats stay losing
gladbmo,Rats are crying out in pain! please! End our suffering! I need to hit em with a rat attack!
Its-ok-I-lift,Eat me rat
SEAKNee,Cringe
Coconut_Dismal,Thank god people like you don’t get to rat around sneaking in grass 100% silent.
