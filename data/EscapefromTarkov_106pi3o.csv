,What a joke that we play a hardcore loot shooter and cant drop fucking bolts on the floor for a friend anymore.
Hexblade757,"I would say the fact that you can no longer post items on the flea market that you just bought from the market or traders was an improvement. 

I think a simple compromise would be to make everything FIR if you actually found it in a raid whether you die or not."
Firefly3564,"""Tarkov is not supposed to be a fun game"" The more and more time passes the more I think Nikita was dead serious with that line."
SpeedsterGuy,"Tarkov was peak where it really was ""The world is yours, do as you please."" 

People trading containers, borrowing keys, quest items, killing AI scavs for bags, it was so fun to just do whatever."

Barcode_88,All the Anti-RMT measures just made the game less fun for regular players.
thetinker86,I do miss taking people stuff to sell on flea
glassbong_,I can't. Because it's too true. It's actually shocking to me that people who experienced old Tarkov and new Tarkov would actually think that new Tarkov is better.
LolzWhatIsThis,personally i think having the quests not requiring FIR status would be enough
iHateSunsetting,I don't mind flee market requiring FIR but quests should not require FIR. It feels terrible.
BARDLER,"I didn't play that far back, but as someone that has been playing for a couple years at a casual pace, I can say that this games identity is really confusing.

They market it as a hardcore realistic FPS but then the controls feel like absolute dog shit. Other mil-sim games, such as Squad, have realistic based movement and guns, but the controls feel good. They use their 'hardcore' description as an excuse for bad game design and UX for the way almost everything is designed.

The confusing part of the game is they have these RPG skills that when you level up make the game feel less like shit. You move faster, your recoil feels better, you can sprint longer, you can jump higher, heal faster ect. They also recently added those crafting buffs on guns that are basically RPG crafting enchantments. There is nothing wrong with RPG elements in games but their approach to balancing those skills is to make the game feel awful until you level them up.

Their entire balancing view is built around slowing down streamers and people who grind the game non-stop. They make early quests harder, they make the flea market harder to get, they make low level skills more punishing, they make the hideout harder to level up. Because of all that this wipe has been the least fun and least rewarding to play by far. I have barely made any quest or hideout progress because I am blocked by a couple key items. My raid survival is way down now too because of overpowered scavs. So at this point what's the point of playing?

There is a great game somewhere in Tarkov. It's just BSG seems hell bent on hiding behind a lot of really bad game design decisions."
generic_pog,"Fuck FIR I miss when marked rooms spawned weapon cases and shit. I remember I got one out of dorms and felt an adrenaline high I’ve never since it before experienced, and yes, I did die with it. Make marked rooms great again"
olishoplifter,"Man I miss fights pre-fir when you would actually be rewarded for pvp. Now Tarkov has turned into a weird crab simulator and everyone sitting in bushes/rooms hoping to get the drop on somebody. I agree some things needed to change, but the whole fir completely changed the game and I'm not sure if it was for the better. It was a lazy fix to a problem that required a real solution. Tarkov really lost it's charm the past few years, and I'm not just saying that because I'm ""bored of it"" or because ""I've done everything."" As long as I got a few good homies to play with I have fun even if I'm doing the same old quests over again. I just miss what this game could have become."
GaryMoMoneyOak,"I think Nikita is more focused on making an unnecessarily hardcore game than a fun game that seems to be actively killing the game. At this point, the game has complete disrespect for your time."
DSM20T,"Valid point.  The larger problem with this game is it's fundamentally broken.  There is no fixing it.  Awesome proof of concept, great innovation, basically created a new genre imo.  

I say congratulations all around but it's time to shelve this and get to work on a proper implementation.  

Booo hissss"
A1KMAN,"majority of people were dead in the first 5 minutes of the raid cause of people rushing to techlight/resort/dropdown/marked just so they could try and beat the hatchet runners before they shove anything of value up their ass and kill themselves to go into the next raid. if you werent doing that you were getting no action anywhere else on the map. if you did rush the high value shit, you were spending a cpl mins gearing, 5 mins queuing, another cpl mins rushing, for less than 30 seconds of action. traders would be instantly sold out of any decent ammo, attachments, etc to be sold for 5x-10x on flea. i dont miss that shit at all"
Verlas,I just miss being able to wiggle fast :(
cj__________,Is anyone old enough to remember this exact thing happening with runescape back in the day? Devs go too hard on combating RMT impossible because a core component of the game relies on it (full loot pvp) . Practically killing their game in process.
Maki_v1,"Removing FiR would probably reduce the aggressive cheating somewhat and more people would resort to hatchet-running. 
I would rather have 5 hatchlings running around instead of 1 cheater."
ASelfie,"New Tarkov is a good downgrade from old tarkov gameplay wise/sound wise/performance wise.

But FIR was kind of needed for these fuckers going hatchlings and jumping off a rooftop, you had a lot of them back then because lets say they would just rush resort, store one GPU and one Ledx, die afterwards, and still make near 1.5 million...."
Aceylah,100% I've avoided so many fights this wipe because I just want to get shitty tasks done.
-Here-There-,I’m just upvoting for the correct use of “peak”
Elowenn,Back when the Mosin was an actual equalizer and Shift+Ws couldn't get away with doing that 24/7 (yes they still won most fights but they still had to fear the Mosin man).
whoisgare,"I’ve only come to agree, not change your mind. Goodbye"
The-Poopfist,"I use to spend hours flipping shit on the flea market, made so much cash just reselling armor and ammo it was like a whole game in itself to me.

I was so sad when they made flea market FIR only"
NouSkion,"Finally, a post that aligns with how I feel. Full agreement from me on this. All these restrictions BSG has imposed in an effort to curb real-world trading have only negatively affected the player base and the game as a whole. Ever since I haven't been able to sell gear acquired through PvP, I have had absolutely zero desire to play. It has ruined the game outright and failed to have any meaningful affect on RWT.

Time to try something else BSG. This ain't working."
DeadMansMuse,"FIR *ONLY* *benefits the cheaters.*

The math is simple, cheater zooms to any item they choose, including people, loots FIR, kills all opposition (erasing the FIR on butt stuff), leaves as one of the only people to get FIR items. Easy monopoly.

The rest of us get lasered before ever being able to extract with our FIR salewas."
Rare_Lifeguard_4403,Not only FiR changes. Why the hell i can't drop some stuff to my friend who plays 2 hours a day just to have some fun. A key for a quest? Nope. Some items for his hideout? No way. A good armor so we can have fun on PvP? Fuck you says Nikita. A labs keycard so we can enjoy a map on a game that we paid some good money for? Neither. This is bullshit and me and all of my 4 friends who used to play this game already quit.
Rezhyn,"Hard disagree. FiR killed hatchet runners and made surviving mean something. Finding quest items or rare items you want to sell should mean you want to survive, not stick it in your ass and bunny hop to your death because you raced to the spot first or got a good spawn. 

Inertia is great and killed jiggle peeking, fights feel infinitely more natural - although weight thresholds need to be lowered. Progression feels better with flea bans and outside of Mutant/BP there is a lot more variety early wipe.

I will agree recoil sucks though. Controlled bursts should be more reliable and spraying can stay bouncy. It does feel pretty RNG and imo (head, eyes) increased very hard with new recoil that bounces around your face."
MadDog_8762,"No

Pre flea market was peek tarkov, as it didnt matter how much money you had,
Somethings you HAD to find

Fir is an attempt to fix what the flea broke"
uchihaoftheleaf69,That’s the point though.. it’s sucks but they want you to feel “scared” and avoid fighting.. making less money etc
Thug_shinji,No the game was far better before the flea market existed. I would love a wipe excluding it.
BetFit2122,You liked it when people flipped items from traders? Or when there Hatcher runners taking all the good shit before you could get there? I’m gunna have to disagree
blindhollander,"The games shit now. Like I get it, they are making changes and they are okay. The games great and dog shit at the same time. But old tarkov was 1000% better. 

They started dropping hints of what development was going to be and what they were working on and at the time it sounded great but 3 years later after they still haven't added more than half the things they talked about and it's just in a weird state on transition the game feels even more empty and incomplete after adding changes than it did 3-4 years ago."
thed0pepope,I think i prefer pre-flea tarkov tbh
matt2k14,"I agree 100%. The FiR bullshit was to help fight the RMT imo. There’s no need for FiR anymore when everything is restricted on the market anyway.  I’ll take hatchlings all day everyday instead of being forced to leave the raid once I find my quest item or loot. FiR forces everyone to go in get what they need and immediately leave and it’s dumb. Without FiR you could stick around(shove what’s needed up your ass)and still PvP and enjoy the rest of the time you have left in the raid, but instead you’re forced to leave ASAP."
teo5151,What is FIR?
OhHaex,pre FIR days were actually enjoyable. even with dying raid after fucking raid.
teamkillgreg,Agree. Once that quest item was found you could engage and fight. Now I bail and run every time because I’m a solo player.
BigShrekDaddy69,Fr needing tasks to be fir is such a piss off
notgaunt,"Get rid of FIR altogether (and the FIR quest requirements) AND also don't allow barter items to be sold on the flea market.

This makes finding a valuable item and stuffing it in your ass worth it no matter what while simultaneously making it useless to do so for Flea market profit/reputation. It achieves the slow down of progression Nikita keeps ham-fistedly trying to chase while providing an escape valve for lower/mid skill gamers to have some avenue of progression through a wall of death after death after death.

It eliminates some of the low hanging fruit of RMT people selling hundreds of graphics cards, etc. day three of the wipe"
PureRushPwneD,oh man I miss shoving flash drives in my prison pocket after looking for so long.. I am so sick of getting to level 25-30 every wipe before I'm done with that damn task and **finally** unlocking PK and skier quest .-.
Kozak170,FIR is dumb because of all the convoluted ways some items count and some don’t. Their efforts to counter RMT did more harm than good. Also hatchet running was honestly such an inoffensive problem to me. After a week or two of a wipe it’s just a shrug and a free kill for me.
Rk0,"Hard agree, I miss pre FIR tarkov."
ranopan0,"Good breakdown, I would add to that that the dynamic loot update of closed rooms made pvp disaster, nobody is even fighting over tech stores anymore, ultra, kiba, marked rooms, reserve servers, all absolute garbage

Wanna do some labs with friends? well too bad you cant even give them a keycard, wanna help late start friend/standard account giving him epsilon? fun detected"
inedibletomato,Hard agree. I got into the game about a year before the FiR flea market implementation got added so I do have a bit of nostalgia for it being my early days but it was great. Also added bonus of being able to play stock market simulator with my rubles when I didn't feel like raiding and it had a whole other element for me lmao
avowed,The game is too sweaty and ratty nowadays.
gearabuser,I agree with you. Post FIR stinks. I also miss high value loot rooms.
beattraxx,"Imo pre twitch drops was the best. 

Small, but super dedicated playerbase, devs weren't having god complexes most of the time, raids felt very intense when you found something valuable and tried to evac, no somewhat ""complex"" game mechanics - just build your gun, get that gen4 and attack backback and fight off the horde of heavy npcs in labs, WHAT A RUSH!! 

I really miss those days and i am glad i quit when eft was, imo, at its peak. Sad to see what happened to the game but at least i had fun most of the time."
DrunkPimp,"Pre-FIR was when I first started playing, so with rose-tinted glasses it was definitely my favorite period in tarkov.

That being said, non-FIR flea kills early wipe, and really ruins the economy and makes the game a meta gun, ammo and armor spam fest.

HOWEVER, casual players do deserve to be able to be enjoy the game and at least be somewhat viable. FIR changes, etc. did kind of kill the progression for those players and really widened the gap... We need a middle ground between pre-FIR and the current state of the game for more casual players."
Stunning_Hornet6568,"I still think they should embrace no FIR for more tasks. Flash drives and gas analyzers come to mind for things that are very early in the progression system task wise and serve no real purpose blocking progress especially later in wipe. Could even adopt a system where you have FIR and from Fleas Market marker and make those FIR be items you only found in raid (including those in secure container) and if a item is from Flea Market it gets its own tag and limitations. Tbh that idea sounds like a perfect middle ground between the two, for posting an item on Flea you have to get out alive though is what I mean but if you shove in your secure and die you can still use for task of course then some take like the stims one peacekeeper gives would be extracted alive."
KindSadist,"Agreed. FIR ruined the game for me. I work 50 hour weeks, have a two year old and other responsibilities. I don't have time to do tasks all goddamn day like a streamer. Not being able to buy anything on the flea market also ruined my experience. I never RMT'd or anything, never played the market, but being able to buy whatver I need was great. Allowed me to do nothing but PVP."
RJohn12,"I definitely agree. a good example is flash drives. right now I need two for a quest. the millisecond I find a single flash drive, I go 1000% invisible rat mode, zero pvp, zero pve all the way to the extract. if the fir stuff wasn't around I could just play normally and still get quest items. or just buy them when I find enough money's worth of loot"
craftySox,">Yes, it had its janky netcode and performance issues, and its ~~cheaters~~. But that.... Hasn't got better since. So not really a valid argument.

It has. A whole metric fuckton. It's still dogwater, but it has improved dramatically on both of those aspects. Cheaters though? Not so much. Although, actually, thinking about it maybe it has a little or maybe they've just got rid of the most obvious aspects of cheating. I don't tend to see many people flying about or speedhacking nowadays - it's just obvious walls and aimbots that stand out.

I agree though, pre-FIR was much better than what we have now and honestly if they buffed scav and loot spawns then I wouldn't mind removing the flea entirely - or better than that a key & container-only flea market.

edit: Yeah maybe not on the cheaters part, looking at the front page others have had a hell of a time with it this wipe it seems lol."
BlazingShadowAU,"I didn't mind the FIR limitations when it made some level of sense, but it so rarely ever did. 

""Hey, I need you to get 3 salewas and get them yourself""

""How the fuck do you know that Salewa was brought in by an enemy PMC?""

""Dunno, I just do, go fuck yourself. You engaged in PVP to no real benefit to yourself, maybe just rat the same fucking locations ten times instead."""
KomatsuCowboy,Been saying this for awhile. Pre FIR was the best Tarkov. Its just been a continuous downhill of fun since.
Kullet_Bing,"If you wanna go there I say pre Labs was peak Tarkov. When labs came, it was mad fun. When labs keycards came and around that time the big streaming event that expotentially boosted the popularity, the game went downhill for me. Labs suddenly was full of cheaters, RMT became a thing for this game, sus af deaths skyrocketed."
DropDeddBlue,"I played daily before FIR was announced, thought it was dumb af LORE wise. How tf would any trader know where I got my shit from? They shouldn't care since people are getting blasted daily in tarkov. I'm fine with the randomized spawns since it helped with hatchlings somewhat. 

But man that flea market before FIR was a whole game in itself. I loved being able to put anything on the market, tracking prices, and making my own missions bc of it. It felt like how a real market would work in a lawless land like tarkov. Saying things are banned from selling just doesn't make sense to me, a Scav would sell his left nut on the flea if he could.

I understood the changes to flea but it really helped the Timmy's out being able to penny and dime extra cash for the random shit they needed to keep them going. Zero to hero wasn't needed if you just followed the market well enough. 

Now I can care less about the flea, and if I find something decent I extract immediately like OP said."
Bulletspong3,"IMO this game peaked at 12.7, so the patch they introduced FiR (or the patch before 12.7, I can't remember). Every weapon was viable in some way because it didn't have mad recoil, the hideout had just been introduced so it was grindy but not too grindy, RMT preventions hadn't been implemented yet so the flea market was actually useful and usable and while there were cheaters, there were less of them or at least it felt like it.

Yes, I know some of you hate the flea market, but some of us don't have 12hrs a day to put into this game to relentlessly grind for what we need. Some of us just wanna spend a few hours a day after work having fun with our mates and enjoying some PVP.

I might be looking at it through rose-tinted glasses because this is the wipe that me and my friends really had a blast on. The game had the right mix of survival and the scavenging elements but also felt the best it ever had as a PVP shooter. The game has seriously regressed since then - performance is worse, audio is worse, the gunplay feels worse. Almost every aspect of this game feels worse now compared to 12.7, except admittedly for Inertia which was a nice change."
Booyakasha_,"The game it self yes, but i do think FIR is better for the game as a concept."
Breadbin3,"I couldn't agree more, it feels like they've took what was a good game (i started playing about 2019, a couple wipes before FIR) and slowly, over time, it's just gotten worse. I loved the game when I first started playing, when you could take a thicc items case into raid and drop it for the craic, or trade containers with people, now the fact that you can't even drop keys or valuable items, it's just a joke.

I've had so many times recently, where I've had like 9 labs key cards before I unlocked the trade from therapist, and wanted to go labs with my friends, but can't, because you can't drop them in raid, and they're rare af to get as a scav, so I can't go labs with friends at all. Personally, I think the game plummeted in quality the day they introduced FIR.

You used to be able to go loot, get some good stuff, stick it in your gamma, and go fight, and get some player loot, the game was fun, nobody was proper try harding at that point, cos what was the point. Then FIR came about, and the only way to make good money, was to rat as a scav, unless your absolutely God-teir at PVP, (which im not) its a joke.

I still remember the start of the hacking problems, the Chinese hackers, with names that were mostly numbers, I still remember, me and my friend were on labs, and this dude chases us around for a bit, hit me and my friend, so we went to go hide and heal up a bit, the guy railed me and my friend through a door, perfectly, head-eyes, both of us within a second.

I really miss the days of being able to just fuck about and actually have fun, not with inertia, that turned fights from who sees who first, to if you run, and someone sitting in a corner sees you, your dead, and can't fight back, recoil that in no circumstance is realistic, FIR, the ever-worsening hacking problem, nerfing fun guns into the ground because ""we dont like metas"", even though, regardless what they do, there will always be a meta, breaking audio that worked fine, the list goes on.

I saw someone make a comparison to warzone 1, and the development of that post-release, and how they just kept adding stuff to the game files, and eventually, it just became a buggy mess, that took up loads of space, and ran like crap, its starting to look a lot like that. Literally last wipe, I was able to run the game on all high settings, and get like 70-80fps, now, I have to run it on medium, and don't even get close to that, constant connection problems, and the serious problem with hackers. For a game, that they're charging well over 100 quid for EoD, I think this is really bad, I don't care if the games in beta, thats not how they're presenting it, and it's not an excuse for them to deliver half-assed updates, that make the game worse, the game is no longer what I paid money for, and is literally a different game, just because its hard-core, doesn't mean that it's okay for them to completly screw over 90% of their playerbase because they want the wipes to last longer, and deter any new players, because of all the dumb shit you have to learn now, like scav AI being broken, scav bosses being unbelievably hard to kill, then not giving any decent loot 99.9% of the time, like why the fuck did they stop scav bosses dropping labs key cards, that was one of the big reasons it was worth going to kill them, that was a guaranteed ~200k drop, but now it's gone.

Streamers didn't help the problem either, they made the game massively popular, and taught new players that the only way to play the game was with ""meta"" guns, a slick or a Hgrid, and the best ammo in the game, which made the game even worse, and even more grindy.

TL;DR - BSG are killing their own game, and ruining one of my favorite games"
Nevermind04,"Found in Raid is a failed bandage to the RMT problem and once BSG realized it did not fix the problem, they should have abandoned it."
acidix,"On the Pogcast, Veritas has told this story multiple times about how the reason that we have run-through as a mechanic in game is because a handful of players were just extracting from factory over and over trying to get their survive percentage up.  Nikita learned this and made them implement this feature.

There are things that just make the game artificially harder, that are really just Nikita or Nikita + a handful of devs, thinking that the game should be harder for harder's sake.  Like, Not having a mini map is hard, but you dont have a mini map in real life, so sure.  However, find in raid?  Why does Therapist care if I found my cigarettes in a box, or if some dude named joe found them and sold them to me for 2000 rubles?"
ezraindustries,"100% correct. If I find a quest item I need I will avoid all combat and leave the map. Before, I'd just throw it in my pouch and play normally and actually have fun. The single worst change ever made to the game. Adds absolutely nothing whatsoever, literally makes people just leave maps faster."
aeshredics,People actually used to push PVP when you could die with an item in your Gamma and come out ahead. FIR was the start of the rat meta.
BoostedWRBwrx,"I don't think anybody will disagree. Everything BSG has done to curb cheating has directly made the game a worse experience for the average players and has done nothing to solve cheating. FIR should be a thing for certain quests regardless but it currently hasn't done anything to benefit players, the game or the in raid experience. The only thing it did help to curb was hatchet running."
jarejay,"I’m going to have to disagree here with a wildly unpopular take. 

The majority of the player base seems to think this game is about combat; about killing other players. 

I think this game is about survival. 

The thrill of “escaping” (the fucking title of the game, let me remind you) with that one item you need to finish a quest you’ve been on for 4 days is so much greater than just killing a dude with an AACPC and a 7.62 MDR, at least for me. 

The way I play the game is goal-oriented. Sometimes I work on tasks to get PMC kills, and in those cases I’m incredibly battle-hungry. If not, I’m just trying to get what I need and get out without taking a bullet to the bucket. 

Some of my raids are 7:04 long, but award 15k exp because I did two quests. I get back in the game quickly because I didn’t loot a bunch of garbage and my servers are selected correctly. 

Basically, the more stakes there are, the more it sucks to die, the more the game feels like actually trying to escape a hostile warzone instead of just playing CoD and shooting guns at people for fun. 

FiR status makes that possible, while still allowing us to have a secure container. They could remove FiR, but they would also have to remove secure containers and the Flea to make it still work the same."
VittorioMB,Disagree. Don’t miss the filthy hatchet runners
ShaddyDaShadow,Pre flea market was peak tarkov
Puzzlepea,"I have to agree partially, I think old Tarkov was peak but not maybe for the reasons you mentioned.

I started playing Tarkov when reserve was released and the wipe after that was peak for me. Being able to carry whatever you could Tetris into your bag without being weighted down was so good. Being able to find 1mil+ in marked room from a weapons case was too great.

So many good memories on raids where we find these massive ticket items and you want to survive. So many awesome fights over marked rooms. I haven’t really bothered trying to buy marked keys since then"
Ch1naNumberOne1,I fucking called it when they made the FIR change. Everyone downvoted me. I hated this change from day 1. And I still hate it. My opinion means nothing and I get it. Just yelling into the void.
FrozenBiceps,The last wipe that you could sell and buy everything on the flea market was the wipe where all  my friends (we had group of like 10 people) used to play 6-7 hours a day cuz it was so much fun after that wipe only like 4 stayed to barely play the next wipe (where everything had to be found in raid) and nowadays not  a single person plays. We just occasionally check this reddit to see if they remove endurance strength or at least revert them back to what they used to be. And also make everything sellable/buyable on flea market like it used to be.
theEdward234,"Absolutely agree. Fights actually meant something back then. Killing a couple geared players meant that you not only make your money back but you also made profit. Most importantly it did absolutely NOTHING to the cheating situation. Even for quests it doesn't make any logical sense. ""Oh sorry I can't take this labs card that you bought, I need that old and nasty one you got from a scav"" did the game have its issues back then? Yea of course, but I would take that tarkov over this one any fucking day of the week. I am truly angry because of BSG running the game into the ground. It's 2 weeks into wipe, 90% of all the posts are negative here, a crazy amount of players already stopped playing, even drops aren't helping, and what do we get from BSG? A fuck all. Their stupid secrecy, the not telling anyone anything, thinking that it's cute and fun is absolutely idiotic. A proper and competent company would bother to learn how to communicate with its customers but no, not bsg. ""Ignore everyone, never admit wrongdoing, ruin the game"" has to be BSGs new moto."
Legendary_Lootbox,"Glad you and many others agree, PRE-FIR Tarkov was best tarkov. 

I used to really love spending hours working on the market, flipping items and letting the rubles pour in, to then go into a raid kitted with friends and just enjoy myself while not having to worry about anything. And It was not that I was OP in any way, I ran LVL 4 armor with an AKM PS rounds so, but back then 7.62 PS was da bomb"
Youdontknowmypickles,"Very strong disagree. People forget that traders would stock up and **immediately** be out of necessary items. Hatchet running made maps die too many times. GPUs were going for 500,000+. It was a shit show. FIR makes the game more tactical and playable."
Dangeroe,But you are assuming that Tarkov is all about fights.
Midgetben1234,I just shot a scav in the face with a Mosin and he turned and looked at me and bam head eyes thats enough tarkov for the week
Subsonic17,Pre sweat streamer tarkov was peak. Just zoomers now
cyberattaq123,"Agreed. It was nice to find your quest items in raid but it was also awesome to be able to just buy them from the flea market. Flea should probably be behind level 10, which is a relatively easy time commitment that most people can hit if playing consistently.

BSG has crossed the rubicon of Realism and Grind versus Fun and Accessible and the game is suffering for it. The game needs to have a gameplay loop to keep you engaged, but in my opinion the loop shouldn’t be grinding skills and traders so you can craft/mod an actually decent gun with bearable recoil that’s using ammo that will actually pen the Chads’ armors their using.

Tarkov is a daunting task now, and god forbid if like me for the past couple of wipes you come in late. There’s no chance. Sure the early game quests are basically totally abandoned and empty for you, but your weapons, mods and skills have no chance against the level 50 professional no lifers of tarkov.

The games time commitment is simply just too high to make any meaningful progress. Maybe when or if the full game is out and progress is permanent and drastically different (if this ever even happens) it’ll be better. But currently with the stage the game is in as a whole with wiping every six months and BSG continually adding more and more roadblocks and things you need to do, it’s just too much.

It’s too many hours of commitment, even beyond games like Destiny 2 or other MMO like games. Realism does not equal insane grind and BSG just doesn’t seem to understand it. They add cool stuff like new maps and cool weapons and systems and then they do shit like lock flea behind level 15, implement found in raid, and more.

Idk man, ive been playing a lot this wipe and really enjoy it, but I wish it was better and that BSG would address the issues the community has instead of just blindly pushing forward and continuing. But whatever I guess, it’s their game right, just don’t play if we don’t like it. /s"
plagueapple,Sounds kinds shit. Didnt play then but without fir but wouldnt lot of the progression of the game be gone and finding an item you needed wouldnt be anything important if you can just put it In a secure container.
raxel82,About two wipes ago was peak for my group. No FiR. Flea at 10. Btc farm worth it. So much fun.
mmpa78,Fuck Found In Raid. FUCK Found in raid being taken away from item in your safe box when you die.
pennyclip,"Yeah it was 100% better with no FIR requirements. There were so many more people fighting back in the day. All these systems to either punish new players or restrict how easy bots/cheaters have it just make it worse for everyone. Seems like a failure of incorporating many different viewpoints in development. 

There were issues of course, like butt running was insanely popular on interchange. I think there are different and better solutions to that problem though."
ShiddyWidow,100% it was peak Tarkov.
dendofyy,"Honestly I think the main issue with FIR quest items is that the items it asks for are generally (sometimes very) rare items, especially at the start of wipe. I personally think it works great that you HAVE to take out the item correctly to be able to hand it in, but lord knows I’ll be crafting flash drives before I ever get them in raid…

It’s also just unintuitive for new players, “find 2/3 of these rare items, in *some* location, without dying on a map that you don’t know, surrounded by people who eclipse you both in equipment and knowledge.”, I’d be very happy if they replaced ONLY earlier Find and Transfer story quests to the type where you pick up a quest-only item, like the bronze pocket watch. More intuitive and teaches lil’ Timmys’ the maps"
koalabat,"100% - honestly tarkov sucks now.  I play it early wipe, only because it's fair for a couple weeks.  Then the gap widens and it becomes pointless and not fun.  I also feel like it goes against the 'spirit of the game' that got me hooked on Tarkov.  The exhilarating feeling of finding something valuable and making it out.  

Back when they implemented the NightVision being un-pouchable was super dumb.  They did it to stop people from using Reap-IR and then pouching it while not in-use....fine...make it so you cant pouch things that you brought INTO raid.  

Pre-FIR was 1000% better because just like top-comment said...it put everyone on an even playing field.  I still haven't read a single argument that this system is better and the 'it prevents cheaters/abuse' is absolute hogwash...its a fucking lazy argument and tbh it makes me kinda mad the developers because they seem to have endless time to add dumb shit to the game, dumb mechanics, dumb weapon parts, and then they hide behind 'oh we have two teams' one for fixing shit and one for adding shit...well guess what - in my eyes you are ONE team, making ONE game, and you need to prioritize making this game playable. 

The theory I have in the back on my mind is kindof racist, but I think the team/developers themselves are behind the cheating in some way.  They probably sell the cheats, when sales slow down, they do a small 'fix' that forces the cheaters to buy something new.  I mean think about it....there isn't a logical argument for BSG's methodology.  It always creates more problems then they 'solve' and if it weren't for their influencer-approach to keeping the game popular, this game would die out and no one would return for another wipe.  

Personally - I would focus on making the game MORE accessible (ie. grow the active player-base instead of promoting this wipe-die out-wipe-die out cycle they have going that clearly doesnt work.  Do they honestly think people will ever treat this game like an MMO where they invest hundreds of hours to level up if they don't even stand a chance as a new player?  Flea market warrior style gameplay allowed me to introduce new people to game, and immediately gear them up to have a fighting chance (they still would get out-played, but at least they had a CHANCE)...that is ruined.   

Honestly writing this made me realize Fuck BSG - can't wait for a clone from a developer that understands how to manage this style of game.  

Dear BSG - thank you for creating what you have created.  But you need to start taking some steps towards listening to your community....it is your MOST valuable asset - the second twitch influencers get a viable new game, you will be left with nothing.  Just (take a look at the history of Heroes of Newarth and how LoL/DoTa destroyed them)."
Phishman9,Remember the old rush to reserve drop down room? That was so much fun!!!! Even if it was filled with hatchlings
Mr_robasaurus,"New tarkov is trying far too hard to cater to the pvp no-lifers who treat the whole game like one big battle arena, and the playstyle of pvp over everything instead of what made old tarkov charming."
frolie0,"This 100%. Even the fact that things lose FIR when they are taken into raid is stupid. I get it for your own stuff, but why is the gun I loot off my kill not FIR? Just a dumb way to slow progression."
EmmEnnEff,"Yes, hatchet running to tech loot that you'd stuff into your ass to sell on flea was peak gameplay. /s

Get your SR to above 30%, and you'll not have a problem with FIR and 'rolling RNG'.

> equal playing field

You know where most gear comes from, even for end-game kits? Vendors. Flea completely removed any semblance of *progression*, by making them irrelevant. If you want to play an arena shooter, Valorant is a much better game. If you want to play an arena shooter with Tarkov mechanics, Arena is coming out sometime this year.

> everyone that finds a expensive item or quest item will just avoid fights and try to extract as fast as possible.

Whereas without FIR, a pistoling or a hatchling loots an expensive item and may as well run into a scav to kill himself, it'll get him into the next raid faster.

People risking a pistol and a paca when going into raid, dissapearing loot into their secure container, and retaining full value of it when they die were a fuckin' plague. You kill them, and you get literally nothing."
dudewist2,I personally like fir because having a grind is fun
mikeinottawa,Uhm.... 2/3rds of the raids were just hatcher runners who died... it sucked.
Scav-STALKER,"I’m not going to change your mind, because you’re right and I absolutely agree. I actually used to have fun with Tarkov. FIR and flea market restrictions have made the game nothing more than a chore"
Dat_Innocent_Guy,Pre fir tarkov you could just study the flea market and make bank flipping high value items. Good old days. Could have like 30 raids and millions upon millions of roubles.
hellhound998,"It feels like we were all punished for the RMT Cheaters, I see no problem with rats, a rat finds 1 item that they want and leave, people who stay find the graphics card on the other side of the shelf that rats didn't check."
RobotnikOne,"Rose tinted glasses always in effect. 
All I remember from old eft is people flying through the sky one shotting everything on the map while immortal. The game is far more playable then it’s even been."
sidvicc,"Hatchlings were a far worse curse on this game than people remember.

People avoid fights now when they find FiR items? Well back then half your PMC lobby would be hatchlings.

What kind of PvP are you going to have when half the people in your match don't even have a gun or any intention to actually play the game."
juicebox_tgs,"I completely disagree, FIr for tasks and flea is amazing. It gives you so much more enjoyment and actually forced you to play the game.

The meta used to be just buying shoreline keys as a hatchet runner and then buying your way through the game. It was terrible"
Sokolberg,"I like FiR more. Back then I would spend an hour a day buying stuff in the flea cheaper and selling later on for profit. Made millions just sitting on the flea. Made no sense.

I think FiR makes more sense for the type of game EFT is. It’s not COD, believe it or not but a lot of players don’t care that much about PvP."
HellDuke,"For some people yes, for other no. I can never get behind the argument that ""people will find an item and will avoid fights and try to get out"". Well... Yes, why is this said as if it's a bad thing? A bad thing would be if there were no reason to avoid a fight at all. When ""shoot first, ask questions never"" is the only logical way to play then the game is going downhill in the wrong direction.

I like another argument with FIR that gets brought up. You can't just go around and sell the gear of your kills, meaning that unless you want to use it you just lost money on the bullets you used. My answer  good, then maybe don't use the bullets if they were not a threat and leave? Going after a fight and complaining that you wasted more money on ammo than vendoring the gear will get you is just like driving your car into a wall and then complaining that repairs are going to cost you money.. Now naturally sometimes you are the one that is attacked, but at that point it's not like the money spent on bullets is there to obtain value, it's there to make sure you are no dead. That completely throws any argument about selling the player gear out the window.

I will just re-iterate something that should be becomming common knowledge. This game is very often picked up by people expecting a game that EFT never was trying to be and should not become — a PvP shooter with some survival and looting on the side. If the one and only thing you come in is to find players and shoot them then all the game has to do is not prevent you from doing that, it does not have to make it easy or the best way to play."
Xitereddit,Nah fam youre insane
Core770,"Nah, pre fir tarkov was a cheater meat grinder with hatchet runners on top. Thanks but hell no. I'd love to play no flea at all but this won't happen most likely"
artosispylon,"i started playing right before FIR and i had way more fun, then every single wipe after that they nerfed players to the point i cant even go into a raid without being overweight and the inertia really is just dogshit."
jakelewisreal,"This sub used to bitch pre-FIR about hatchlings running to popular loot spots and getting it all, which means less actual PVP and less loot.

There’s no winning on BSG’s side. FIR was the best outcome to prevent hatchlings and keep PVP up."
Life_Extension_8258,i like current inertia tho
mackie5283,Yeah for sure nothing better then 80% of the server being hatcher runners.
Mr_Bleidd,The old pre market Tarkov was best
Fairwell08,It truly was. Laser M4s I will take back any day. I was toying with different builds in my hideout today. The AK recoil is so bad alita actually shocking haha and when labs had no key card. Everyone had the ability to run gear and play for what was actually really good PVP. The amount of rats now because of FiR and all that is wild (not complaining) I just would rather fight someone with gear than naked mosin or dick helmets and brown stock SKS.
Boreal_FarOut,"It was great except for such a lack in pvp, everyone I used to kill in resort was a hatchet runner that already had all the good rooms loot shoved in their prison pocket"
Fictitious1267,"Maybe if they removed secure containers, and gave us a secure docs case you can't access in raid."
josephtule,Used to love playing the “stock market” good times
NaNiBy,You shuldnt need FIR items for most of the quests. I have put 80 hours in this wipe so far and I wasnt able to find a single flash drive despite running reserve and only hitting cabinets for pretty much half this time
monet820,Best for tarkov would be removal of flee market.
Ranger1803,"Nah, buying through quests was stupid. Easy max traders in a week for everyone whos half decent"
HumaDracobane,"I think they peaked with the patch that added the SR25 and the X-5000, iirc. That patch also added the postFX.

The FIR was good when you couls sell anything as long as you had the object with FIR, that prevents from people just going arround shoving expebsive gear in the secure container and roll in millions even being killed. Yeah, some of them could run away from the map as soon as possible but was a good change."
xzGomez,Facts
TheHappyMile,"I think FIR and other ""annoying"" mechanics are good.

You know I am missing? The old ""spawn on one side, extract on the oder side"". :/ 

That was really great. Atleast on some maps like customs that rea really linear. Shoreline would probably benefit too due to one side being useless. Obviouly this would not work for maps like Interchange, Reserve or Streets.

And yes, it would meanless room for spawning, that's why it will never ever happen. I know."
AueR6,Yeah. That and many other bullshit changes like 5% boss spawn chance. This game has become more of a grind than typical Korean MMORPG. Imagine making games for fun...
DawSkii,"Nah dude i feel like they even should remove the flea cuz it breaks the game, but also make traders have more items for barter, and add more hideout crafting, then the game could be so much fun, but i think if they would do this they should make wipe longer, like 9 months or even a year for players to be able to grind it"
JVTAO,"Yeah, remember really good when I played before FIR, things like, ""wow, a gpu, this is much more value than the gear I currently have, just put it into my pouch and PvP now, even if I die, It will be worth it""   
Then, after FIR, whenever I played with friends, they started to say things like ""Wow, a GPU, I have to leave now the raid guys, and please avoid PvP"""
Cold-Produce4770,no need to change your mind
WhiteLightWarrior,"Not to mention you literally didnt even have to do quests.  I could just pvp and be better than everyone else, make 100 mil, and be a fucking juicer all wipe.  That was the dream. Now im forced to suck off these traders with lame quests."
Ziomkowsky,Pre flea market Tarkov was even better
N1LEredd,"Y’all forget that pre fir 80% of your server was naked guys hatched running high value loot spots - disconnect once the ass is full and sell it all, rinse repeat. 

We don’t want these times back."
zazasLTU,Pre-flea market. change my mind.
Psychological-Arm-22,"Nikita is in tears of laughter and wiping them tears with our money. Cash. 
- And let me tell ya he has plenty to wipe with."
InfantSoup,Peak RMT is different than peak enjoyability.
Remote_Age8506,100%
NabuBot,Old tarkov played more like cod while new tarkov is more like arma. Since the game is supposed to represent a hard-core shooter I think new tark shows that better even if there's a lot of drawbacks.
sanctionTheOrcs,I think about scav karma same way you think about fir.
nekronos,Before Fleamarket was best
Certain-Mulberry9893,"Yeah, def. Imo they should keep the fir for quests only, but let people be able to buy and sell stuff on flea regardless of fir. If they do that, then they should remove all the global trader limits and set personal trader limits for everyone and every item. That way you can buy off a trader and sell it straight to the flea for profit, but you also then have to wait until the next restock to buy it."
coolstorybro42,flea market is a scourge to eft and should be removed would make the game a lot better
oliot_,I think found in raid is definitely a positive adds way more risk and makes the game more intense. Game would be too easy if you could just stick anything in your gamma
DrMalware,I enjoyed it when we didn’t have med animations and you could just spam heal
DaBluedude,"Disagree.   I think fir adds complexity to the game that creates way more risk / reward analysis.

Tarkov was peak before dynamic loot. When key rooms reallllly meant something.

I like inertia, I like fir, I don't like whatever this audio system is, I don't like content over making the game run smoothly.    I don't like garbage servers. And I think the anti cheat is laughable.

If we made the big change to register player movement on server side, then why are there still impossible movements happening from accounts that aren't insta-banned?"
SUNTZU_JoJo,Nahh...pre flea market days was peak.
OscarPapa1,Pre flee was peak
Mikey3DD,"I'm gonna throw my 2 cents in. So most people who pay for RMT or carries, and I am making an assumption here but I feel a reasonable one from previous discussion that have been had. Most paid carries and RMT transactions are likely carried out by people who have lots of money, but little time. People who want the best loot, keys and gear, but don't have all the time in the world to get them. People that are bad at the game and don't have the time to put into getting better.....

Well hear me out... Surely every single decision BSG make that makes the game more Grindy, and even harder for casuals will drive the rate of paid carries, RMT and casual cheaters UP, not down. The more of a timesink the game becomes, the harder it is to aim and shoot, the more these people will use artificial aids just to play the game and not continually get shit on. 

I believe the decisions they are making to combat cheating at having the exact opposite effect."
BigAsian69420,"This is very true, tarkov now is just dull. You can actually test this out, go back and watch any tarkov video pre found in raid or pre inertia like landmarks lab video where he brings in like every case and feel the feels."
tacobellisdank,I agree.
Not_B1M0,"so sad i missed it
pretty sure by one wipe too
so many people want it back too but bsg doesn’t care sadly"
Paythunder4,I agree
shilunliu,yes this is what nikita wants the less fun the better
MyHouz,"Agreed. Personally, I also loved the one or two wipes where there was FIR but no restrictions on ammo, armor, etc. 

You could sell the 180 rounds of Igolnik and the Slick you just got off the raiders, which felt like a worthy reward, but there was no incentive to hatchet until you could shove a few GPUs up your ass.

My feeling is that the fewer the limitations on selling, the more fun the game was. Just me though."
h0nk1337,"Hard disagree. Just buying stuff for quests was boring, the little dopamine (or endorphine? serotonin? idk) spikes when you finally find that third gas analyzer or whatever you're currently looking for and the increased thrill of making it out alive because of it are much more engaging.

Personally I'd just completely abolish the flea, piecing together a decent gun with stuff you found in raids is much more rewarding, at least to me. But I realize that not everyone feels that way."
Moeswack,"Say what you want but cheating is much much better than it was back in the day, but old tarkov was best tarkov 100"
lnfestedNexus,i miss pre fir.
aBeaSTWiTHiNMe,"Sam is absolutely right about people just avoiding fights now and having everything on the line to make it out with your quest item.

That's when they started hard changing the game for hackers/cheaters/scumbags. Those scumbags just found another way around it, because they cheat, and the entire legitimate playerbase was left to deal with the terrible TERRIBLE system of found in raid. Like somehow this MRE is only good if I found it in a box outside. Or these 60rnd mags, which can no longer fit in a secure container, are only good if I found them outside; not if I buy them and prove they work."
ALifeTooLong,"Yes, nothing like taking the need for survival out of the survival fps. That makes total sense."
HuckleberryOk3553,"I agree. Preach on. It’s not coming back, but we can dream."
