Voidbearer2kn17,"I can't pick Renegade or evil options easily. It just doesn't sit right with me.

Then I played Star Wars The Old Republic as a Sith Inquisitor. I picked the first Dark Side option and chuckled. By the end of the tutorial planet, I was cackling like a Saturday Morning cartoon villain whenever I picked a DS option.

One of my favourite instances was this exchange on one of the later planets.

Me: Completing the storyline

NPC: That's a relief I thought you were going to use Force Lightning on me.

Me (clicking the Dark Side option): Thanks for reminding me. (That was the dialogue line, not me talking to myself) \[Zap!\]"
ummnumm1,This is me when i play stanly parable i hate making the narrator sad :<
Sentsuizan,Currently playing a low honor run in Red Dead redemption boy is it tough to kill all those people
tehtris,This is me. I could never go evil in these games. Idgaf if these are pixels and algorithms. I end up caring too much and trying to help everyone. I think bioware revealed that this is normal behavior a while back. That most people play through the good route.
Jeb500,Except for that reporter.  She gets punched every time.
ThereIsNoAnyKey,The only renegade decision I can never make myself pick is lying to Mordin in 3. He doesn't deserve it no matter how I try to justify it.
linkheroz,And they still say video games cause violence 😂
goosu,"I was a renegade from the start. Easy peasy. You don't have to pick every asshole option to be renegade. You can still pick some paragon options, especially when the renegade is unnecessarily harsh or mean-spirited. Most renegade options, in my experience, were giving people the harsh truth or doing something badass but dangerous in a fight. 

Much of the renegade just plays out like a military version of doctor house (somewhat of a dick but also doing what's necessary to get the job done), not a roving maniac. People are just doing it wrong here, it seems, or they've just never done it. They've simplified it to you have to be 100% blue to be paragon or 100% red to be renegade. Also, the renegade options may be harsher, but they're also way more badass."
sirbruce,I remember KOTOR being like this.
SkelliFun,"Meanwhile we all hit that renegade trigger on Kai Leng like it insulted your house. Sure, letting him kill himself like the punk bitch he is is funny, but shanking him is more satisfying."
taavidude,Picking the evil options in SWTOR is so fun tho. Although some dark side options are pretty unnecessary so I pick light side options. I've never done a pure light side or pure dark side playthrough.
Muroid,"The first time I played KOTOR, I created a character I was intending to be fully Dark Side for my first playthrough. The *very first* time we got a dialogue choice that could go either way, I felt so bad about the idea of picking the Dark Side choice that that became my Light Side character.

I went back and did do a Dark playthrough, but it was a lot easier once I’d done all the good options and could treat the second round choices as “not real.”"
InsaneGunChemist,"I can never justify renegade playthroughs of ME, purely because it is literally just shooting yourself in the foot. You get nothing special for it, it just makes it harder to gather everyone you need."
Destpot,"Shot mordin once, lnstant deletet the save and startet new, can't do it"
Rossmallo,"I am a complete and utter softie when it comes to videogames - if a non-lethal approach is possible, I am taking it, no hesitation. I mean, hell, I got the “eat no civilians” achievement in Prototype on my first attempt, and I didn’t even realise it was a thing until afterwards. 

That said, sometimes non-lethal / Good runs can result in some interesting outcomes. When I played Black Flag, I went non-lethal unless it was outright mandated by the story, and it took me until later to realise something: 

What exactly is the Navy that we keep stealing shit from going to find more intimidating: A bunch of ships disappearing, or ship after ship limping back to port, having to explain how their entire ships of heavily armed troops failed to stop them getting robbed by a pirate using only their bare hands and sleep darts?"
rasherencryptstp07,"This was the issue I had with Knights of the Old Republic. The red choices weren’t “evil mastermind”, they were “psychotic Batman villain”."
RGbudvit,*laughs in rimworld*
neonpinata,"I can only do pacifist runs in Undertale and Deltarune. I don't care if I never get to fight Sans, I like when he's proud of me 😅 And what kind of psycho could kill Papyrus, anyway?"
PokehFace,I tried a renegade run of Mass Effect once and said something mean to Garrus. Never again.
TheEmperorMk3,"Except when dealing with Batarians, they can eat shit"
JabaDaWocky,"Paragon is my playstyle...but renegade is. just. so. **cool.**

How else can my Shepard have a heart of gold, but hellish fury towards anyone who hurts the innocent?

That's why I like PC. I can still have my Paragon endings, but still get to take the occasional renegade actions."
tech240guy,"There's an article I read a long time ago where they actually had statistics on Mass Effect or Dragon Age uploads where they compare paragon and renegades characters and their respective choices (I can't find it), but it was interesting how majority play paragon, but even if they play renegade, a lot of the paragon choices are still selected."
OdenShard,"Playing bioshock 2, I could never go for the bad ending. When the little sisters look at you and see you as a protector when you get the chance to let them escape or kill them for their Adam. Man, as the oldest brother to several sisters, there was no way I could pick the bad option."
keeper_of_the_donkey,"I'm sure there's plenty of people in here that agree with me that most of the renegade options made no sense whatsoever. It was like, this choice is completely evil for no reason other than just to be a dick. Shepherd is a soldier, and makes decisions based on how to achieve the objective. So doing things that make no sense is stupid. Being good for goodness sake makes sense, but being a dick for no reason? Evildoers don't do things for no reason. There is a goal, and there was no goal with at least 75% of the renegade choices."
Lucy_Little_Spoon,Not me playing Fable again XD
CtznSoldier4088,Personally I find it easier to be mean when I play as a woman
uberDoward,Renegade for life!
Mister_E69,You ain't ready for Undertale
ForeignCapitalOut,I blew up megaton once (fallout not ME).  Felt so bad I reloaded as soon as I saw the crater :(
QuickKill,"The Wolf Among Us had a feature that made it easy. 

I'm the same, being nice to people. But at the end of each scene you get stats. ""96% of players made the same choice as you"". That made me go, ""Wtf. Fuck that, I'm choosing the opposite of everything I chose before."""
ohmyfuckinggodhamlet,"""OK ok this time in Fable 2 im gonna be evil.""

*3 hours later I have a halo*

""Damnit..."""
horizontalrain,I pick options to balance paragon and renegade. Some people need to be punched and some people need a second chance.
saljskanetilldanmark,This style made it difficult to make out what I was looking at first.
lyinggrump,Holy cringe
The84thWolf,I literally can’t do a whole renegade run for this reason
Bleklteg,"feel this in my soul . i do a run every couple of years all the way through 1-3 all dlcs n all that fun stuff. ive done every kind of run and romanced everyone, seen all the scenes where they make you choose blah blah blah. its a wonderful fantastic game and i loved 3 eat my ass"
ZenMonkey47,"Good and evil always seems to come off as ""Nice vs Asshole"", in a perfect world it should be more ""selfless vs pragmatic"""
Allip84,This is me I try to do evil runs and just can’t bring myself to do it
Xynth22,"Yeah, I just can't bring myself to play bad or evil characters. Even in SWTOR, I played a good Sith Warrior and Inquisitor, which actually ended up being awesome, and making more sense than just being an evil asshole simply for the sake of it."
FSCK_Fascists,I still don't know what harvesting a little sister is like.
WeLiveInAnOceanOfGas,"Star Wars : KOTOR - doing an evil run and being pretty successful until...

""Please sir, would you buy this trophy? It's the last thing my husband hunted and I cannot sell it here because I'm not a licensed hunter. I have nothing... I just want to get home, please 500 credits""

Never fails, the voice actor just nailed it. Even went the extra good route despite setting back my lightning."
