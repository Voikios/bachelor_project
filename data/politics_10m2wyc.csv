black641,Imagine being such a bag of shit that the investigation DESIGNED to clear your name only reveals MORE CRIMES you’ve been involved in.
poop_scallions,"According to federal law, Durham has to rell us why he didnt prosecute Trump.

&nbsp;

>As special counsel, DURHAM owes us a declination memo for the trump crime he investigated.

FlintBlue,"The original NYT article is a must read. The depths of the incompetence and partisan bias is breathtaking.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/us/politics/durham-trump-russia-barr.html"
Rowsdower84,Trump is a career criminal. This should be easy to agree on.
T1mac," > ended up investigating him for potential financial crimes 

And Barr and Durham buried the investigation into the Trump Italian crimes and it never got a real investigation."
DrugDoc1999,And despite all the investigations his ass remains free and at will with no consequences.
bubbaeinstein,Trump is a very sick man.  The people who support him are the scum of the earth.
OppositeDifference,"Whoopsiedoodle.  Gosh. 

:)"
NUMBERS2357,"It also says they went after George Soros seemingly just to harass him:

> Mr. Durham used Russian intelligence memos — suspected by other U.S. officials of containing disinformation — to gain access to emails of an aide to George Soros, the financier and philanthropist who is a favorite target of the American right and Russian state media. Mr. Durham used grand jury powers to keep pursuing the emails even after a judge twice rejected his request for access to them. The emails yielded no evidence that Mr. Durham has cited in any case he pursued.

Funny how everything people claimed about the investigations into trump and Russia, actually happened with Durham's investigation.  Politically motivated, flimsy justification, using intelligence of questionable origin, bringing BS charges, going after enemies, accusations used for political theater even when they can't hold up in court, ..."
curatoo7,Right out of his playbook.  Make a crime and then cover it up.  Then investigate to uncover dirt and bury it.
Ivorcomment,And the G.O.P. want to launch investigations into the weaponization of state institutions - it would appear they have stumbled upon a perfect starting point.
Estoye,This bad news can't take away the fact that he won [the Senior Club Championship at Trump International Golf Club in unincorporated West Palm Beach last weekend.](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/sports/2023/01/24/donald-trump-declares-himself-winner-of-his-own-golf-championship/69835418007/)
DidntDiddydoit,"Does this call for a DJ Khaled ""another one"" or ""congrats you played yourself"" gif?

I can't decide."
knoxknight,Oh no! The leopard is now eating its own face.
rollicorolli,That's what happens when you lead a life of crime and can't keep your big mouth shut
bluelifesacrifice,"If Republicans were half as zealous to their own as they are to democrats, we'd have a kick ass republic that wouldn't just be a powerhouse, but lead humanity into global peace and take to the stars.

Instead we have this.. Cartoonish kind of dumb corruption that just burns all our potential.

It's so frustrating to read stuff like this. We can't catch political leaders and officials on small levels of corruption because of Reagan, Bush and Trump just wrecking the potential of our unity.

This is why we can't have nice things."
BlueCollarBeagle,You can't swing a dead cat in the Trump Administration and not come in contact with some illegal behavior.
ccasey,"How many times do we need to hear that he’s a fucking criminal before he gets indicted? This is nuts, I wish I had whatever this fucking privileged douchebag does"
overit_fornow,The tRump Organization is an ongoing criminal enterprise and anytime law enforcement even looks in it’s direction they see crimes. How about enforcement DOJ?
Necessary_Row_4889,"“Officer, officer thank goodness you came so quickly! Those kids are making so much noise over there I can’t cook my meth, I am just too distracted!

Plus none of the people, people, children really, that I am trafficking can get a wink of sleep. So please go talk to those kids?”"
CoSpringz,"Read the mueller report, hes guilty as hell."
No_Animator_8599,"All the coming GOP house witch-hunts coming to get even with the Democrats is just going to make uncover more crimes and incompetence from the Trump administration and their party, just like this."
clydefrog811,What a stable genius
Comfortable-Guitar27,I demand a special counsel to investigate this special counsel's special counsel!
SugarDaddyOh,Italy tried to warn us.
Msmdpa,And Barr never said a word about it
A_Rabid_Pie,Trump is Confused! Trump used 'Investigate!' He hurt himself in his confusion!
HauntedCemetery,"Literally any group that looks into either trump or right wing groups for longer than the initial headline finds corruption. 


The group trump himself sent to AZ to investigate the vote found *more* votes for Biden, and zero bamboo fibers encoded with 5g bill gates virus. 


Conservatives, feel encouraged to jump in and explain. For all you're whining on r/conservative about free speech you can all still post here, and anyone critical of trump has been banned at your little safe snowglobe."
stregawitchboy,"We are moving into:

""Yeah he is probably a crook and such, But I'm still glad I voted for him cause he did so much for our country, but probably time to move on.""

Fucking morons . . ."
Teddy_Kay_Gee_Bee,Seems like a very Trump thing to have happen. Bless his heart.
Eggyhead,"“He couldn’t have committed crime A because he was too busy committing crime B, which is generally acceptable for rich people in America so he clearly doesn’t deserve consequences!”"
crashomon,Irony. Only the Finest Irony
Vladimer_Trump,What a pathetic group of professional losers professional sneaks and professional liars - including barr and durham.
FoxRaptix,"The bigger story is that Barr and Durham basically covered this up, but as well as more confirmation that Barrs sole duty was to discredit the Russia investigation"
Advanced-Cycle-2268,This is regarding the Mueller (sp) investigation?
carterartist,"Saying the Russian allegations came from “illegal spying” doesn’t make the charges any less true, and the patriot act gives a lot of leeway on spying on spies."
Truck-Nut-Vasectomy,I keep hearing about financial crimes but what I don't ever hear is handcuffs.
formerfatboys,They're going to be uncovering this man's crimes for decades. It's so fucking bonkers how off the rails it went so quickly.
Bellamac007,Yet he still wakes a free man. White collar crimes pay big in the usa
kandoras,"You have to be the dumbest fucking criminal in the world to invite a cop, even a cop you think you've bought to go after your enemies, to dig through your life."
Independent_Prune_35,"I heard that people in glass house shouldn't be throwing stones? You can fool some of the people some of the time and you can fool republicans all the time, but it is harder to fool a person who can think for themselves!"
RDO_Desmond,Trump is just dirty and dishonest. He revels in it too.
ArrowheadDZ,"> Trump spokesperson Liz Harrington in a statement to Insider on Thursday slammed The Times for printing ""propaganda,"" and doubled down on the assertion that the Russia probe was the result of ""illegal spying.""

Again no denial whatsoever that there was collusion, only that the discovery of the collusion was unsavory.

It’s interesting to me that no one—Trump, Flynn, Manafort has ever denied any of the actions they were accused of, only that *calling them out* for having done them was “politically motivated.”  Unspoken in that is the idea that “we just assumed it would be OK for us to do this, and are aghast that anyone has a problem with it.”

Sessions is really the one exception.  It’s almost been long forgotten that the singular reason that Sessions had to recuse himself was because it was discovered, and he was forced to admit, that he was having inappropriate and potentially illegal conversations with Kislyak months prior to the 2016 elections."
Boise_is_full,"Listening to Barr describe the Mueller Report and Durham investigation always felt a bit like Seinfeld's ""The Opposite"" episode. 

I now have the evidence to support my suspicions.

Unfortunately, the people who need to wade through this article won't spend the time to disabuse themselves of what they think they know."
BackgroundGlove6613,How the fuck did that orangutan commit so many crimes in broad daylight? We need to pass some laws addressing white collar crime ASAP.
frugal_masturbater,"I may sound like a lunatic here, but ...

WHEN ARE WE DOING SOMETHING TO PUT THIS GUY IN JAIL?

I couldn't do 1% of his crimes without being put away. Everything is ""being investigated"" as that is justice, and fucking NOTHING is coming from it. He could be running for President in 2026 and as it looks to me, nobody is doing anything about it.

""Can't upset the people, they'll revolt"" or some bullshit line.

Oh god I am so fucking sick of these impotent messages that mean absolutely nothing."
Chi-Guy86,"More crimes for which he’ll not at all be held accountable, most likely"
Garzino,Does anyone feel anything beside a strong need to eyeroll when they read these articles? Maube it's because I'm nor from the US but everytime they find something about Trump and his friends nothing comes of it.
Appropriate_Mess_350,That explains why Trump is in jail…..
throwy_6,Why even tell us this. I never want to read about trump and his various crimes he’ll never be held accountable for
magicsonar,They bigger question is why didn't Mueller investigate his finances from the beginning?
SeniorMillenial,"“The possibility that Durham might file criminal charges buoyed Trump allies, who long suspected a conspiracy against Trump.”

That is patently false. Nobody made the conspiracy allegation in good faith."
HGruberMacGruberFace,I don’t understand how this isn’t bigger news
Lawmonger,This was just a shit show. Taxpayer funded political attacks.
_your_land_lord_,And not doing shit about either....

elainegeorge,What if they took the evidence and “lost it?”
MeetInPotatoes,"brb while I go necro a hundred ""Durham is coming""  tweets to post this."
Threeballer97,"""I don't see anything about Sobotka..."""
darthbane1412,"Just like Colin Robinson on Better Call Saul, haha."
CheerioJack,Dumbass trump been sniffing too many sharpies.
FUMFVR,More or less a catch and kill operation though. They didn't want other parts of the DOJ investigating it so they could 'investigate' it.
malignantz,Hoist by his own petard!
KyotoGaijin,"Obviously, MamaCeleste is a deranged Never-Trumper who shouldn't have been allowed near a kitchen. Did you see her biased and depraved text messages with Chef Boyardee?"
nolehusker,But did it clear him on Russian collusion? That's what really matters./s
Wizzle_Pizzle_420,The Q folks must love this.  Durham was their man crush forever now…well maybe not now.
1arctek,Durham was milking the government all he could for four years and then showed up with nothing.
21stCenturyAntiquity,"""Mama always said life is like a box of chocolates. No matter which one you bite there's a subpoena inside."" - Forest Trump"
bro_please,"This is another instance of ""Catch and kill"". Well done, Barr."
afinlayson,"Can someone write this Netflix series already? It definitely should be a comedy, because anything else will feel like a tragedy."
Away-Engineering37,That's how karma works!
CDubGma2835,But it didn’t end up investigating him (squashed by Bill Barr). It only pointed to additional malfeasance that should have been investigated.
BiteFancy9628,r/leopardsatemyface
Mbaker1201,… and nothing will happen to him.
Alternative-Flan2869,Everything skeevy benedict donald touches turns into crap. So dim.
mattttttttt97,Congratulations you played yourself
BoyScoutReddit,I genuinely LOL’d at work
mebrow5,Imagine that. Criminals gonna crimm?
LackingLack,"Yeah in other words: no Trump is not a ""brainwashed agent of Putin"" but yes he's certainly corrupt and certainly not a good person.

I wish Dems could stop the insanity regarding Russia at some point. At first I thought it was just a tactic to hurt the GOP and try to embarass them and win over exurban dads or something like that in the midterms in 2018. 

But it seems a TON of Dems truly are insanely anti Russia and this is part of why Biden Admin was unwilling/unable to negotiate with Russia and avoid the current conflict in Ukraine. Instead, massive escalation with sanctions that are the CAUSE of the inflation which just gave the GOP the House."
BDoubleSharp,Boring
itrainmonkeys,None of this shit bothers me until somebody is actually held accountable
meatball402,"So what?

He's not facing consequences for financial crimes.  He staged a coup and stole (and possibly sold) state secrets.  Nothing happened to him."
RICAN46,"I thought I would find more smart commenters here on REDDIT than on Yahoo, but I think both sites are inundated by gullible ignorant people!!!"
