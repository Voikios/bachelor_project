Gastkram,These two have murdered a lot of people
z_AxioMatiC_z,"I just played all 4 for the first time ever on the remastered collection. The first one felt like an arcade game, kind of a tech demo. The second is great, the third went a little Resident Evil 5 for my taste and the fourth is one of the best games I've ever played."
ILoveRegenHealth,I haven't played Uncharted 1 since forever but I have a feeling that one holds up the least.
nowaifu4you,Played all 4 and man what some great games they just feel like seeing some good fun action movies
TooLateForTacos,"The amount of excitement I had for the PC Uncharted collection, before and after I found out it was just Uncharted 4, gave me fucking whiplash."
captainzigzag,"The Crash Bandicoot scene in Uncharted 4 is so great, One of my all-time favourite moments in gaming."
dem-feet123,dem feet
AmIbiGuy_420,The first game I beat on the ps4. As a kid Indiana Jones was one of my favorite series ever. Loved pulpy adventure stories about explorers and treasure hunters. So playing through Drakes Fortune after growing up with only a wii just fucking blew me away.
BryanMac1,Game is awesome i have everyone
kdk200000,The scene where Elena finds out about Nathan adventure in that room loool
EvenIslandKingdom,Uncharted 2 *chef‚Äôs kiss*
Tusturd,Elena‚Äôs ü¶∂ >>>
WonderRev,uncharted series is just üî•
Trowisk,"I always feel like less people like Uncharted than what the sales numbers actually say. It's a shame because I played through the collection recently and some of the set piece moments are still some of the biggest and most epic moments in gaming. I can't quite put my finger on it but there's something Naughty Dog does in those moments that make me feel like I have more agency and control than when other people do huge set piece moments.

Im probably wrong but I just don't see people talking about the Uncharted series as much as I think they should be."
RunsWithKeyboard,Among Thieves is my favorite
MumblingFlint,"Just had the same experience with the nearly 30 year old game ""Archimedean Dynasty"" (german title: ""Schleichfahrt"")

It was my first PC game back in the days and I always wanted to play it again, but was worried that my memories where tainted by nostalgia.
Well, after nearly 4 hours in a single session I can honestly say they weren't. Yes, it does not look 2023, but story and gameplay are still awesome."
Internet-Mouse1,Man i love Uncharted 4 so much
Winker2009,I actually just replayed all of them to get the platinum trophies. One of the best series of games out there. Im excited for whatever Naughty Dog does Next and hopefully we get another game in the series down the line!
mrfauxbot,Yea these 2 have more blood on their hands than Joel and Ellie lol
ItsEaster,The bullet sponges really ruined this game for me.
Wakizashiuk,"It's very rare a series manages to end so masterfully. When I completed the series, for once, I felt completely at peace with only fond memories."
WineOptics,"*‚ÄùWell, Well, Well..‚Äù*"
Toothpicktoes,"Uncharted 3 is better than Uncharted 1, I‚Äôm just saying"
Morrisonbran,It was some good shit
JustLinkStudios,"Those games are insane. Like the last of us I discovered how amazing they were very late. Only got a ps4 pro about 4 years ago to finally play all the exclusives I never had. I‚Äôve always been PC based. Bonus was I got all the triple A games for like ¬£5-¬£10 each. Finished the last of us and the sequel came out a week later, played GOW and then the sequel teaser dropped. Played Uncharted 1,2,3 then instantly bought 4 for ¬£3. My eyes could not believe the detail, fidelity and overwhelming creativity. Truly are masterpieces of gaming, the last of us especially. I still remember watching the E3 demo of it when I still lived in my friggin parents house!"
chkraise,The best part of the game is the online multiplayer
stairflyer,"My little sis insisted for years that I tried the uncharted games, which she was a huge fan of. I caved in the summer two years ago, and ended playing the whole series with her across the summer. Ended up being a great time full of banter and good games, and great last memories with her"
CrasVox,Truly some of the best games ever.  I wish this series continues.
Teasinghorizon9,I want a ps4 or 5 to play these games again. I miss uncharted.
Siriacus,"Something that always broke the 4th wall of exploration for me when playing the earlier Uncharted games:

You uncover an old map that directs you to a rusted old key which unlocks a run-down pathway into an abandoned castle that hasn't been occupied in centuries.

Until you make it into the courtyard where an entire platoon of henchmen have somehow setup an entire armed defensive position with mounted LMGs, stockpiled ammunition and explosives. 

There was always someone to greet you on the other side."
Bonnle,I only have PC and want to play the previous Uncharted games. How can I access them? PS live? Is this on PC too?
Taxi-Driver,"I just finished part 4 yesterday the graphics are probably some of the best I have ever seen, the voice acting is phenomenal and the game overall feels like it's made with alot of love but it just doesn't feel like much of a game to me. It's just so scripted and so on rails. No mechanic has any depth, the cover shooting feels like a relic from 2013, the traversal is hold the analog stick and look at the vistas. What I really loved was the last boss fight and I wish the game had more of that. I didn't really feel like I was doing much. It's like an interactive movie which I guess was the aim but I just wish it had deeper game mechanics and gave the player some kind of agency. At some point I just got bored and I wanted the game to just be over . I understand why people love these games and I understand why people also don't like these games. Overall im glad I played it but left me yearning for something more."
Jasole37,"I'm glad people actually enjoy them. I however don't. I find them boring, predictable, and generic. I got about 3/4's of the way through the 3rd game, realized I was bored out of my skull and didn't even care how the story ended.

One of the few games I have played that I haven't seen the end credits for."
These-Conference-179,Elena still my forever digital wifu.  Games were so good.
Naelamartinez,Who here have played all the uncharted?
Tegerus,Tried playing the newer tomb raider series thinking it would give similar vibes and the first one was decently good but the 2nd one lost me. I wish they'd make an uncharted game for ps5 maybe with Sam or Nathan's child.
ImportedZombie254,I tried playing them recently and the controls are terrible
Billy_Rage,"What a dumb post.

I played a well loved game, and turns out I really enjoyed the game. Isn‚Äôt that so cool fellow gamers?"
TheManInTheShack,How does it compare to The Last of Us?
Username927482,The first one is horrible
SirDavidJames,"Good news! They are remaking this game as well! I think it's another studio that is not naughty dog. 

After playing the Last of Us Part I remake I have to say that it did indeed warrant a remake."
Bpanther696,Most over rated franchise in existence
Bastymuss_25,"Easily entertained eh?, good for you."
JewDizzle1,So true
Wasteak,You can't even find a gif that matches your text.... What a crappy post
Ryakkan,Best Series ever in my opinion
HellsMalice,I would also be overwhelmed if I enjoyed such a mediocre series of generic action movie tropes tbh
Jack-Daniel,Those sweet sweet dopamine hits!
spiltzmilk,I never understood why people play these games‚Ä¶you might as well just watch a movie. I mean all you really do it push a prompted button move a little and watch cut scenes.
Potatoes-Mcgee,No idea what the game is about sorry.
IncestGiraffe,I never understood what people liked about that terrible series.
No_Savings_9057,Right!?
RPKM01,I did the same but for god of war
Schkywalker,Is there a way for me to play every Uncharted game on PC?
AlphaParadoxx,"I really wish I could say the same. I never liked uncharted, or God of War, or horizon zero dawn, or ghost of tsushima... But I did really enjoy Spider-Man, resistance and the infamous series."
Jakes_JunioR,Now I have play the Nathan Drake collection really badly.
Grenflik,"I love the whole series, especially Uncharted 4 how it ended. ü§åüèΩüíã"
megasean3000,"Still to play 2, 3 and 4. Held off on them for the longest times."
God_master_273,"I played uncharted from the first to last
An I am planning another time now it's actually good"
Substantial_Ice4316,"I beat the game like 36 times, and I'm not exaggerating"
manonymus,Drills3d vs selfdrillingsms vibes :# Better keep my mouth shut
BON3SMcCOY,Glad yall are having fun
Veeznuts,"Unchartered is my far my favorite series. I prefer third person shooters, but love the story line and the game play. I also enjoyed MGS4 for similar reasons. The latest Max Payne was a fun shoot ‚Äòem up game. Is there any other similar 3rd person shooters you would recommend?"
MrMiaw,"Tbh I love Uncharted 4. I've beaten it like 3 or 4 times, but I just cant get in to the other ones. I played like half of 1 and 1/3 of 3 and just doesn't have the same magic"
Unexpected_Wave,Uncharted 2 is still my favorite video game. Naughty dog really know what they are doing
Osirus1156,I‚Äôm thinking of getting this on steam. Is it worth it?
gen0m11,"I haven't played Uncharted on Playstations, i first tried U4 and that was yesterday on PC  First impressions were that there are no run button which was so weird when i was running out of jail and trying to do jumps that needs boosta, that the graphics are amazing and that its very strong story driven game (thats great thing but not for the first starters like me who missed first 3 ones, eventhough U4 is story for itself). For now the biggest downside is that Nathan is way to slow and that is very slow game with a lot of cutscene. I loved trolling NPC, mostly his younger brother and that main prison guard."
do0tz,Me playing uncharted just to play crash bandicoot
TaskMaster130,Best in game couple imo
A_Russian_Otter,Are there any plans to bring the full series to PC? I never had a Playstation. And don't wanna spend money on one since I have a PC.
VladeMercer,It is more priceless how she is really sincerely appreciating the experience.
Filthy_BBC_Meatpump,Not with that controller you‚Äôre not. PS3 is where uncharted started and I don‚Äôt think it supported ps1 controllers
Logondo,"Me playing Halo CE.

I mean it's old, but it's still good. Definitely worth-while to replay the campaign every now-and-then."
MrBeanyBoi96,Crash Bandicoot is the best Uncharted game.
EstikLapice,Life used to be so simple ü•≤
AmbitionExtension184,I tried to play one because I‚Äôm a huge ND fan and it was legitimately one of the most boring games I‚Äôve ever played.
Ppleater,"They've aged so well. Even the first one is lots of fun, even if it doesn't have as much of the pizzazz of the following 3."
Xillllix,Did they add ray tracing in the PS5 version?
Stosh65,The only relationship I am more invested in than Nate and Elena's is my marriage.
Jurani42,"Just skip the first one 

*ducks for cover*"
flybonzai,Favorite gaming couple
snorkiebarbados,Only thing I didn't like about 4 was his Mrs. She literally follows you up a mountain. Watching you murder people the entire way up. Then wants to talk about her feelings because you didn't tell her about this adventure? Bitch there is an entire school worth of children without a father now!!!
Fionichi,"HOW TO WIN HER IN THE holly molly ""CRASH BANDICOOT""?!"
AdAlarming8601,Love the series
HansChrst1,"Played 1-2 and 1/3 of uncharted 3 and found it underwhelming. I had heard so much praise for the trilogy and I think that is why I ended up not enjoying it as much as others. To me it seemed like Tomb Raider, but less fun. I also played it on PS4, so aiming was frustrating since I play all shooters with a keyboard and mouse."
Kaiden92,The first two games haven‚Äôt aged super well in my opinion. The controls are stiff and clunky in a lot of ways that have been smoothed over by newer entries. Still a fun series tho.
DJistheNerd,"I'm working backwards, adored uncharted 4, am super surprised 3 holds up as much as it does, can't wait for 2 and 1"
DJistheNerd,Is it me or does Uncharted 3 have better melee than uncharted 4?
Estoye,Ah yes. The Banjo-Kazooie emulator.
teenageechobanquet,"never played an uncharted game.normally love things like dark souls,roguelikes,and jrpgs.someone sell me on why I should finally start uncharted!"
Great_Contest,true
bitNine,Amazing games. Just wish they weren‚Äôt PS exclusives because... no PS.
g051051,"I've never been able to play more than 30 minutes of the first one without walking away.  It just doesn't grab me.  I know it's me, and I'll try to put in a better try when I have more time, but it's been a tough climb."
Tigerstorm6,Kinda wish sony would get the stick out of their ass and release it both on pc and Xbox. Easily one of the best treasure hunter games out there
Optimus_Prime_Day,I jist replayed 4 and liked it more the second time around than when it first came out. Great series.
RoyalT17,Can you be both glad the series ended and hope it has another installment?
MrYeaBuddy,They're my comfort games that I go back to from time to time as well. So good.
CrimsonFatalis8,The guy from Fortnite
Impervious_Rex,I love their house in that game! So jealous of it.
,I play it to watch Chloe‚Äôs ass
PelinalTheBloody,"Me finally playing 2 and realising that they are vastly overrated games. 

Good games, but not to the level people hype them up to be. That's most PS Exclusives, though."
TraveyDuck,Even the first one?
RoyalFalse,That is my favorite chapter of Uncharted 4 and it's not particularly close.
Arrogancio,"I know it's dark, but I think it would have been a great ending if he kinda woke up and realized that he was bleeding to death after that fall in the last game.  Just, ""Oh my God... I imagined that my wife came to get me.  Why would she be here?""  Really drive home the cost of his brother's actions.  There really  wasn't a price for all the mistakes that were made."
adampsyreal,"While waiting for a friend to finish gambling, I just finished replaying this game yesterday on my steam deck while sitting in a casino bar."
shatteredframes,"Just finished playing through the series a week ago. Did the first 2 for a second time since release, and 3 and 4 for the first time. Honestly, one of the best gaming series around. Great characters, gameplay, and each story is an absolute blast."
Indiemsc,Oh man! These are my favorite games hands down. I remember when I played 4 and felt empty after I finished it. Couldn‚Äôt think of anything else to do besides play it again.
MassSpecFella,I can not get though this game for the life of me. I get to Madagascar and I‚Äôm bored. I thought I would enjoy it more on pc perhaps with mouse and keyboard but no. I enjoyed UC2 when it came out but climb climb climb shoot shoot shoot book book book climb climb climb etc gets really boring.
sekoku,"I wish Naughty Dog would work Amy's trilogy over to Steam instead of Druckmann's Last of Us. But alas, we didn't even get U4's multiplayer in the PC port, so I shouldn't expect much. Especially with the dire sales on Steam U4 had out of the gate (really, porting the last one first was a baffling decision). :("
Catch_022,"I'm struggling through u4 - pretty far in it but I just find it boring and not fun. The combat seems terrible.

I do enjoy Tomb Raider.

What am I missing? :("
yvonnesnakedhusband,"I played 1-3 twice before playing 4, and spin off"
Annoying_guest,then you realize there is a movie for no good reason
randomguy987654321,"The scene where he is chasing after the people chasing after his brother was the most exciting moment I've ever had in a game.

https://youtu.be/2MEpYiS2aOI

Figuring out (by accident) how to fight the flying colossus in SotC is a close second."
Dj_wheeman3,One of the greatest game series in my opinion
Alukrad,"What truly made uncharted to me is Nathan drakes' wittiness and laid back personality.

This is the reason why people loved that Nathan Fillion fan made uncharted movie. he captured drake's personality so well. 

Yet, they kinda changed that too much in uncharted 4."
rifathridoy,One of the best games ever
keyshow23,Wish the developer remake the Trilogy on par to Uncharted 4 graphics & controls instead the last of us
DanceChacDance,For free???
_MaZ_,"Damn, need to get a PlayStation 5 so I can finally play these. Could get the 4th game on PC but why would I play the ending first?"
entelechtual,wow Tom Holland aged poorly.
Whaaaaaatisthisplace,"I have never played uncharted before.

Is it as good as tomb raider or the same?"
4M1R98,Anyone else ever wonder why they changed the sound of the pistol 92FS or whatever it was called from a good one to a peeshooter in the second one?
feverghoul207,Damn bitch put those toe away
Mr_Golf_Club,Where do I play them? I fell out of the PS rhythm when they came out and never rectified this. Can they be played on PC at all yet?
Aryboy26,Although not bad imo I very much prefer tomb raider over uncharted. I don‚Äôt know why but the gameplay in uncharted just feels kinda janky to me.
mr-teddy93,"It feels like such a movie all the games everthing you do is so forced 

Animated movie"
Reagan2791,"I‚Äôve only played UC4 and actual near the end of my second playthrough now, this time on the remastered version. It‚Äôs been great! Not sure if I‚Äôd want to play the older games, though."
khriss_cortez,"I played this game for the first time like a month ago, I'm in the last chapter now and honestly I am enchanted, great game"
throatfucker01,FOR FREE THO? IN THIS ECONOMY
ryan8954,The best movie based game
Conscious_Clock7299,"plays a critically acclaimed game series

is then 'suprised' when it still holds up

üôÑ Low effort af idk how stuff like this blows up"
NoPop2592,You should see me playing Ms. Pac Man.
Seerinix,I'm currently in the process of one hundred percenting the game
FartherAwayx3,The hell is that controller? It's like a PS3 controller decided to cosplay as a PS1 controller...
seniorfrito,I was really disappointed that they didn't bring the first few games to PC. I don't want to play them out of order.
seniorfrito,I was really disappointed that they didn't bring the first few games to PC. I don't want to play them out of order.
iamthelastofus,I just wished they remastered Uncharted 3 Online Multiplayer. That was my favorite part of the games and also my favorite part of any game ever.
WarOnDurgz,"Effects Volume - 6

Dialogue volume - 6

Music volume - 11"
Sylanthra,Unpopular opinion. I didn't like Uncharted 4 (only 1 I played). It felt like I was the stunt double for the main characters that showed up in cutscenes while I did the action parts except they forgot to give me the script. It did not feel like I had any agency in the game at all.
Fathoms77,"Still one of my favorite franchises of all time. Played Uncharted 4 again a couple years ago and I was stunned at just how well it held up...it was STILL head-and-shoulders ahead of just about any other game I'd played since. These are just always high watermarks in the industry, period."
cuttershark,I‚Äôve never played Uncharted. Is it really recommended I play from 1 or is it gonna feel dated?
Nearby_Hat_2346,"At one point, I enjoyed the games. Now, for me, they‚Äôre okay. Replaying the third game ATM, again for me, it‚Äôs kind of a drag. The second game is one that I‚Äôll always enjoy though. 

The multiplayer was far from perfect and balanced, but boy I loved it. I spent hundreds of hours on the multiplayer."
Suspicious_Comb2421,üî•üî•üî•
Maximum-Replacement7,That Uncharted is my first experience of the series.  IMO it‚Äôs the best.
Kamwind,They need to give me a way to skip all the poorly acted video and just read the dialog and let me play a game.
theclipclop28,"Compared to real games, like ER, it's just a glorified TV show."
Playmaxx,Best Game Series that has ever been created
anti-social_ROBOT,"I never liked Uncharted, none of them. :/"
PrinzXero,*Spin attaaaaack!!!*
excelllentquestion,Really? Its so fucking corny
peanutismint,"How is it that, in all of gaming, there‚Äôs only really one series like this?? That is to say, like playing an Indiana Jones movie‚Ä¶. I know people will say there‚Äôs other games like this but no, not on this level."
magick_68,I sucked at the game like nathan did.
Special-Charity-7067,"when I got my ps5, I saw uncharted 4 was free as a PS Essentials game. I bought the all game bundle on a sale, hoping to work my way up to 4.


1 was tough. I recognized I was playing an ancient game, but it was 10-15 hours of not very fun gaming. The story was occasionally strong enough to keep me invested, but longer exploration sequences were tough. 


2 was fun. There were some very memorable set pieces, the city, the train. But I got very tired of playing the formula by the end. The ending was tedious too. Shangri la was cool, but that boss battle was awful. And the combat is so annoying, I was so sick of playing the gameplay loop.


I don‚Äôt have the heart to pick up 3, especially after reading it‚Äôs worse than 2. I want to make it to 4, but honestly I‚Äôm burnt out. It‚Äôs been many months since I finished 2, I can‚Äôt work myself up to starting 3 or 4."
Seasaul,Cant relate
