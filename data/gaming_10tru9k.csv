BlueHarlequin7,"Hell, in later generations some of them are literal gods..."
megasean3000,“And one of them is a genetically engineered killing machine that very few Pokemon to this day can beat.”
Altruism7,Also 10 of them are in parallel universe called Pokémon Red
majesticx_luk,"""...While I stay with your Mother"""
Logondo,"Any yet...I have the uncontrollable urge to catch 'em all...It's like I'm indoctrinated...Hypnotized...

*gotta catch 'em all, gotta catch 'em all*

*gotta catch 'em all, gotta catch 'em all*

*Gotta catch 'em all, Pokemon!*

*Charmeleon, Wartortle, Mewtwo, ^Tentacruel, ^^Aerodactyl*"
jonathanquirk,"Some of the Pokémon in the sequel games could only be found when you later revisit the original region, bizarrely. I figure some of the 150 Oak wants you to catch in the first game are actually those (Houndour & Murkrow are the two I can remember), and he’s utterly baffled when the player turns up with extinct species, a computer program, and a clone of a myth instead."
WarLawck,"Also, don't worry about feeding them or giving them attention. Just let them rot in our computer system. No biggie"
damnsignins,"[Are you telling me they're ***making*** new pokemon‽](https://youtu.be/C_Zlh7EwAWU)


Edit: [More.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKrGZPvyy1VOxJPrKdQ0kE5LiD6gZGdpT)"
Jarvis_Strife,"I miss when r/adviceanimals was the peak of meme culture 

An elegant format for a more civilised age"
heatisgross,""".... don't forget you'll need to traverse through spacetime to trade other yous for 10 alternate timeline pokemon"""
GreedyDiceGoblin,"I've brought this up before,  but it is funny isnt it?  No one knows that Mewtwo exists, but Oak did.  He knew enough that he could program it into the pokedex.  The only way that this makes sense to me is that Oak was clearly a member of Team Rocket operating alongside Dr. Fuji while the experiments that would lead to the creation of Mewtwo were occurring.

Oak is an ex-Rocket member, and you cant change my mind."
DynamoSnake,This meme format is older than some people on this subreddit
Keksis_theBetrayed,Holy fuck what an artifact this is
X0AN,"And now we have 1,008 pokémon but yet not decent game in which you can actually catch 'em all.

They really don't need to make anymore pokémon, they just need one epic game."
xian0,Basically every time I receive the specification for a new project at work.
BuckNZahn,"… 8 only exist in a parallel universe

Several that require an item of which there is only one 

A few that you can only evolve by trading them…

It‘s insane what they got away with back then"
Ritehandwingman,There is the age old theory that Oak was just trying to get rid of Ash so he could bang Mrs. Ketchum.
masterlight123,"This mf just went to google and searced up ""meme"""
addrien,"Also, 6 of them you can only get through trading with an alternate reality version of you that chose a different starter."
RealRotkohl,"Can anyone tell me which ones the 5 extinct, the 3 myths, and the 1 unknown are? Virtually no idea about the Pokémon lore."
coreybd,To be fair he doesn't tell you there's 150 does he. Aren't you the one discovering them as you go and logging them in the pokedex?
Just_an_Empath,Also whenever you're done there will be 100 more to catch.
Put_It_All_On_Blck,"Professor Oak doesn't actually expect you to catch all 150 Pokemon. He's just sending you away on an impossible mission so he can bang your mother, who is now home alone for months."
Monkee-D,Also one is a glitch that will literally destroy your entire world if you catch it.
Roraxn,MissingNo. needs to fit into this mandate somewhere just to knock the absurdity out of the park.
TheThagomizer,I first saw this exact image macro during Obama’s first term in office.
Heroiccrayfish,And about a dozen of them only exist in a parallel universe.
trident042,Red: *Comes back with 151 just to spite the old motherfucker*
erk1701e,"It always bothered me that Mewtwo came before Mew in numerical order. Like, how can the clone of a Pokémon and has the number 2 in its name be #150 but the very model of its existences is #151…"
SneakyCarl,"""... while I stay at your house and bang your mom"""
Ditju,"I have come to recontextualize the ""complete the pokedex"" task as a field study of all currently existing pokemon in a region. The pokemon themselves are already completely discovered, no person expects a 10-year old to discover new species. Instead, by giving every single new trainer a pokedex and sending them out into the world gives the professors valuable data on current numbers and migrationary habits of pokemon."
aznkl,"AND ONE OF THEM IS A GLITCH 

\#justiceformissingno"
arcalite911,"If anyone can do it, it's the 10 year old with 20 years of experience."
aaron_adams,"Well, of course, he tried to give Ash an impossible task.  As long as Ash is out of the house, Oak can continue to pork Ash's unusually hot mom."
Ghiren,"Here are 3 starter pokemon, none of which even EXIST in the wild. The only way to add the other two to your pokedex is to find friends who chose differently from you at the start and haven't evolved them yet."
pencilvesterasadildo,Gosh dang. This meme format is damn near old as Pokémon.
BringBackBoshi,"""P.s. you're 10 years old. Time to stop sponging off your parents and get out there and be somebody. Also I expect you to find many Pokémon I never could despite being 50 years old and a renowned expert in the field. Be careful exploring those active volcanoes and vast cave networks, good luck!"""
Lord_Knorr,Also you're  like 10 years old. Seems like a legit age to just go off on your own
KaimeiJay,And 1 of them was basically 3D printed by humans so we could round up from 149.
DenimDann1776,He was just trying to fuck your mom dude
Chummmp,"And I’m literally only allowing you to take one of the three here, with the others also being unobtainable in the wild"
JayJayGolden,he just doesnt want these kids to bother him again
Kasaeru,There's 151 in the original if you count the thing that should not be
TripleU1706,"Let's not forget the fact a child needs to travel to unknown and untold dimensions in some of the games just for a completionist award.

Hell those ultra beasts might technically not be pokemon."
