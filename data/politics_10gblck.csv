sugarlessdeathbear,"It appears the tactic is as follows:

- have proof of something

- make accusation without providing proof

- wait for denial

- provide proof

I like this."
keziahw,"> ‚ÄúI do presentations at 1940 in Jacarepagua, I do Cascadura, I also did Cabaret Casanova in Gloria and I did one at Le Boy,‚Äù Santos says, naming well-known drag clubs in and around the city.

So he's probably performed at every drag club in Rio, except those 4."
LiberalHousewife,"I have to be honest - at this point, this is just incredibly entertaining. I don't think I've ever really known of a person who legitimately lies about everything. I find it interesting. Like, does he really believe these things? Does he have any shame? Does he think it'll all blow over? Will he ever come clean? Does he really think everyone is as dumb as he apparently thinks? It's fascinating."
Q_OANN,"He‚Äôs also African-American‚Ä¶‚Äùno no, I said A-Freakin‚Äô American‚Äù"
Hatter-Madigan,I cant seem to actually view the video. where is it?
Al_Redditor,McCarthy is giving him the Cawthorne treatment. This just shows that the GOP knew all of this and ignored it.
InsomniaticWanderer,"Republicans: ""we must protect our kids from ThE gAyS by banning and investigating drag shows!""

Also Republicans: ""We've elected a drag queen to Congress."""
Searchlights,"One book, ""Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me:  This sort of thing is my bag, baby"" [written by Austin Powers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh6kbQnOAg4)"
mredofcourse,"It's amazing how he's actually more outrageous than the Jon Lovitz character Tommy Flanagan:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYNBwCEeH4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYNBwCEeH4)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLRKhdQnd-k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLRKhdQnd-k)

  
I wouldn't be surprised if Jon Lovitz as George Santos isn't the cold open on SNL this weekend."
orionsfyre,"Did he really think that no one ever took pictures or videos of him while dressed in drag? 

Is he delusional?"
Coooo8,His roommate alleging that Santos stole his Burberry scarf is perhaps my favorite additional morsel. It's so petty and I love it.
OldWatercress7,No that‚Äôs Anthony Devolder
2020bucketlist,"I will say it again, this man's life is fucking insane!!"
reddig33,He looks better in drag.
thewhitedeath,"That website is poison on mobile.

Clicked 3 video links - None of which are the video. The fuck?"
Junketway,"I'm afraid he's mastered the Trump art of ""tell the rubes what they want to hear and they'll do anything for you""."
donkeyheaded,"This seems silly and fun, but the sad reality is we have a mentally ill pathological liar in Congress."
PRPLpenumbra,I like his eye shadow. I suck at makeup üòî
neromoneon,"If George Santos said that the Sun was going to rise tomorrow morning, I would prepare for life in eternal darkness."
MintBerryCrunchJr,This is the absolute cherry on top of this cake. Conservatives are going to lose their fucking minds.
reddwarf666,"Compared to the sour, entitled, chagrin and misunderstood face he normally pulls, he actually looks happy in drag. Ah, he shoulda stayed in Brasil and be the queen of the party."
jchowdown,"If you think the GOP will expel him just because there's a video, you're incredibly naive.  
He'd have to push for affordable healthcare or taxing the rich before they'll lift a finger."
dust-ranger,In the POST of all places
kombatunit,Does george have a sibling that only tells the truth?
spicedpumpkins,"He's the embodiment of the entire Republican party.

Liars, swindlers and hypocrites."
buddytheelfofficial,"His denial (in part):

>The most recent obsession from the media claiming that I am a drag Queen or ‚Äòperformed‚Äô as a drag Queen is categorically false

I‚Äôm no expert but spelling drag queen with a capital q seems like a very drag queen thing to do"
Zimbah,Am I the only one who can‚Äôt find the video in the maze of ads?
KanyeWestBrick,What the fuck is up with this guy?!? This is like an insane movie plot.
clive_bigsby,I don't know why everyone is so upset. I think it's so commendable that the Republican party elected the first drag queen to Congress. So progressive of them!
hotdog31,He‚Äôs gotta be a comedic political stunt.
Rusalka-rusalka,"I was pretty sure I noticed makeup and contouring on his face at times and he looks like he‚Äôs had some stuff done such as fillers so he is probably still doing this sort of thing which isn‚Äôt bad in of itself, it‚Äôs just something his party wouldn‚Äôt be ok with him admitting to. He gives me Milo Yiannopolous vibes."
hungoverlord,"I hate to say it, but he looks like he'd make a great drag queen."
Significant-Dog-8166,Wasn‚Äôt Marjorie Taylor Greene cozying up to this guy?   Huh‚Ä¶ Weird when I realize this means MTG has more drag show performing friends than I do.
Graphics_Nerd,"*Oh lordly there's video.*

I don't know what the GOP is going to do here. They're so staunchly anti drag now along with everything else that isn't in direct support of evangelical christianity. 

Practically every single thing out of Santos' mouth has been proven to be a lie. And the icing on the cake is how GOP congressional leaders stand behind him ***ONLY*** because he's a republican."
First-Funnies,wait til the porn videos come out...
trrrad,Has anyone seen George Santos and Sacha Baron Cohen in a room together?
masstransience,"GS: That‚Äôs not my bag baby. 

Brazil: One signed copy of That‚Äôs my bag baby by GS."
jeffinRTP,I must be bad if the post is mentioning it.
CandyCoatedHrtShapes,This is juicy!  üòà
johnnyvisionary,This dude's getting Madison Cawthorned and I'm here for it.
AntiqueTelevision365,He is way more bankable as Kitara.
Hour_Landscape_286,"After all he did, being in drag is the one thing that will take him down.  Republicans can forgive all manner of crimes, lies and malfeasance, but they draw the line at Gay"
dancingmeadow,"He's about halfway between Boebert and MTG on the ""pretty psycho women"" chart."
NormalService1094,"He actually looks pretty good in drag. Have to admit, from the beginning, I have wondered whether his suits were the actual drag."
cnh2n2homosapien,These full throated denials are harder and harder to swallow.
JanitorKarl,"The news today has been entertaining, to say the least. I'm enjoying this greatly."
cerealfordinneragain,He looks great. Probably the most honest thing he‚Äôs ever done.
SomeNoteToMyself,Republicans are such hypocrites
SamuraiCook,"Being an lying, criminal con-artist who lies about his mother dying because of 9/11 and defrauding a veteran is perfectly acceptable for the current GOP.

These pictures and videos of him in drag will trigger them to turn on him and eject him faster than the wheel chair Nazi that blabbed about the traditional GOP coke fueled orgies."
SpankBankManager,There‚Äôs absolutely no way George Santos is his real name.
Dr_Dickem_MD,This is so delicious
QAPetePrime,Doesn‚Äôt matter.  A video of him gunning down people on 5th Avenue wouldn‚Äôt be enough for House Republicans to remove him.
mazzicc,"$10 says he still gets elected to a second term after denying everything as fake news. 

Everything about him is so outrageously unbelievable, that I can‚Äôt help but think ‚Äúit‚Äôs impossible for him to get elected‚Ä¶but I thought it was impossible for *all* the stories about him to be true‚Ä¶‚Äù"
ArtisanJagon,It could come out that this guy is a child raping sex trafficker and conservatives would still support him
HikeRobCT,Andy Kaufman strikes again.
,"George Santos: ‚ÄúMay I remind you that my mother was in one of the planes that crashed into the Holocaust? Yeah, she was in Auschwitz when the towers fell.‚Äù

/s"
plusgoodduckspeak,Where was all this shit before he was elected?
TeamMountainLion,This dude is like The Onion scientifically created a person to defy headlines
Great-Heron-2175,Stop republican groomers!
hughdint1,"Technically he never performed or competed as a drag queen. He just dressed in drag, but didn't have the charisma, uniqueness, nerve, or talent, to actually compete or perform."
once_again_asking,I came to the comments expecting thereto be a link to the video. And I'm very disappointed.
tabrizzi,"""Video shows"", but there's no video in the article. Not even a link to one."
Reasonable_Highway35,Holy shit the drag story was true?! I thought it was just humorous throw away line from wherever I heard it.
LateStageAdult,Hilarious receipts.
Positive-Routine961,It would be fun if George dressed up when he goes on the House floor.
Freezepeachauditor,Huh‚Ä¶ he looks pretty good!
kellyandbarbie,"Damn, he would do some great Kyrsten Sinema drag"
bordumb,"What the fuck timeline is this‚Ä¶

You couldn‚Äôt even write a MadTV skit that is this batshit insane."
SlurReal,"If George Santos isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúKitara‚Äù then I feel like at this point Kitara would be screaming into every microphone they can find, ‚ÄúI am NOT George Santos!‚Äù"
tobiasxny,"Honestly, this scares me more.

I wouldn't be surprised to see him pivot and use this to be like ""I used to think it was okay, then after participating realized they were all groomers"" or something.

This just seems like it's going to give them ammo."
tcmart14,"Man, next we are gonna find out he also plays Santa at all the malls and is Ronald McDonald. You never know what‚Äôs next with this guy."
RecommendationKey163,I knew it. I wondered why I got gay vibes off him.
Necessary_Row_4889,I am going to say it: he‚Äôs a better looking woman and should have just stayed a queen.
D-life,"I have no problem with his history as a drag queen.  I have an issue with him lying to his supporters.  If you're a politician, you may stretch the truth, but you can't tell sloppy lies that reporters can research only to discover the truth instead."
antftwx,"What the actual f is a ""drag-denier?"""
appendixgallop,"I think I'll make some t-shirts: ELECT MORE DRAG QUEENS!

Sorry it had to be George to break the sequin ceiling, but it's a start. The nation needs this."
JoeBuckstrap,"He has all the qualities necessary for a Repugnant leadership position: no honor, no ethics, no morality, no principles, no conscience, no ideas, no platform and no sanity."
InfinAF,"What's a ""drag-denier""? Someone who denies that they do drag? Or someone who denies the existence of/validity of drag altogether?"
venicestarr,Some men just look better as women.
CrushTheRebellion,Anyone else getting serious Andrew Cunanan vibes off this guy?
YeetingSlamage,This mf is a mix between a chappelles show sketch and an onion article
Ozzy9517,I'm gonna say it. He looks great in drag
AdkRaine12,But wait!  I thought he said it wasn't him.  How can this be?
UtahUtopia,Why does this come out AFTER the election.
MadRiverMount,It‚Äôs always the ones screaming the loudest.  Figures.
Historical_Garbage99,This has got to be a bit at this point. Is he just a really bad Dem spy lol
Elon_Muskmelon,George should‚Äôve played the Hot Dog guy in that [I Think You Should Leave](https://youtu.be/WLfAf8oHrMo) sketch.
choopie-chup-chup,"I thought this 'Santos is a crazy liar fraud' running gag had run its course, but it just keeps gagging"
Mugsyjones,Republicans: do as I say not as I do. I misspoke
CosmicAstroBastard,I‚Äôm just waiting for the day we find out this dude‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt even George Santos
PaganCyC,"If his whole life is a lie, is it that surprising that he lies all the time?"
Wrong-Acanthaceae511,I feel like the Republicans just hired an actor and hoped nobody would notice.
EmmaLouLove,This sums up the republican party so perfectly.
MustangMimi,This keeps getting better and better
PorchHonky,"The GOP will now use Santos to show how ‚Äòinclusive‚Äô they are, and accuse anyone who calls for his resignation as being ‚Äòanti-trans‚Äô"
s8nzweb666,GOP Groomer Grifter Gotta Go
Trayew,This guy gets more and more ridiculous as the story improves. It‚Äôs almost as if nobody bothered to do one smidge of due diligence on him.
callmehibi,Ugh him and Lady Maga give drag a horrible name.
BeKind_BeTheChange,"I get the feeling that he is the same type of sociopath as Frank Abagnale, Jr."
Vegoia2,"Repubs are using him to distract, they know it wont last but really it shouldnt have gotten this far at all."
Jmanmyers,It's just getting sad at this point with every new lie. He needs a lot of professional help.
hehehehuejje67,üòÇ can‚Äôt make this stuff up  show this to de santes he is a freak lol üòÇ
Ifixart56,"Well, that‚Äôll be the nail in the coffin for the GOP. Cuz u can be anything (pedophile, adulterer, criminal, con man, etc.) but if you‚Äôre in drag‚Ä¶you‚Äôre done."
Popgallery,This just keeps on getting more interesting.
96nugget,What a time to be alive
woodspaths,"This guy is lightning in the bottle!  I mean, what else are we going to find out?  Can‚Äôt wait for episode 2"
thisisntshakespeare,He looks pretty in drag. He also reminds me of someone.
AirportNo6558,Amazing how Madison Cawthorn was so easily replaced.
Atrocity_unknown,"This is actually Sasha Baron Cohen, right?"
eazykeyzy,Ladies and gentlemen; The republican party in a nutshell
CptPottawatomieBrown,No fish was served.
ametora1,Most honest politician
the_sylince,This dude‚Äôs story just keeps getting wilder and wilder
AceCombat9519,Hide his lies or make a new one
,"At this point, we‚Äôre going to find out he‚Äôs also into scat and pics are going to leak any day. I can only dream."
Fr00stee,r/nottheonion
Reymarcelo,Classic republican move üòÇ
up_and_downtown,"I heard George Santos won an Olympic Gold Medal while on an African Bob Sledding Team and a bob sled ran over his cat after the cat swallowed the gold medal. His team mates ate the cat. That‚Äôs why he left Africa to come here and play volley ball. We should all be proud because that volley ball team crushed Yales team. Now he‚Äôs a Congressman. Go Santos, Go Santos, Go Santos"
TongueTwistingTiger,"How do you live THIS KIND OF A LIE without soul-crushing stress and anxiety unless you‚Äôre a fucking psychopath? I‚Äôm asking this honestly. 

This man has zero scruples and absolutely no integrity. What a fucking shitshow the GOP is."
Realistic_Expert717,The plot thickens
Zestyclose_Meet1034,"While the link loaded, I was like, I don‚Äôt want to see this, so I closed it"
DM_me_ur_tacos,Are we at peak GOP yet? Must be getting awfully fucking close with this guy
beeedubdub,Grifters gonna grift
julbull73,"How can you tell the GOP are setting this guy up to be ran the fuck over...NY Post is piling on and they are leading with him being not fully straight. 

That way the base will be ok kicking out the icky guy."
colocasi4,Caption this [https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/01/george-santos-denies-pageant-queen-named-kitara-ravache/](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/01/george-santos-denies-pageant-queen-named-kitara-ravache/)
InvertedBear,"At this point I‚Äôm just waiting for Santos to turn, look into the camera and say, ‚ÄúLive from New York, it‚Äôs Saturday Night!‚Äù"
Impressive_Pin_7767,I saw an interview with one of his former roommates in New York City. He said that Santos (going by Anthony Devolder at the time) said he wanted to be in Congress so he could get free healthcare and a pension.
TheStarkGuy,"Who the fuck is he? Like really, I know all about him being a politician who lied about everything to get elected, but just who is he really? Who is the real man behind the mask?"
piratecheese13,I‚Äôd love to see santos fully pivot and accept and be proud of their identity. It‚Äôs a shame what a political ideology does to a person.
LuckyRune88,"Republicans voted for a Drag Queen 

Bless their conservative hearts"
byndr,"This article is complete dogshit. The embedded video isn't the one described in the headline. They have hyperlinks that suggest they'd take you to it, but they take you to completely different articles. It's just a convoluted web of obnoxious ad placements. Where can I find the actual video of him in drag?"
GrimmRadiance,Drag community is going to read this piece of trash to filth.
usmcnick0311Sgt,HeS gRoOmInG mY ChilDrEn!¬°
muffledvoice,"It‚Äôs both tragic and hilarious that the Republican Party has become a magnet for insane, cynical psychopaths."
taptaptippytoo,Dude clearly has a problem. He seems both driven to lie and driven to put himself in situations where he bound to be caught. It must be torture to be stuck inside his head. I almost feel bad for him.
BaneThoth766,"That is one creepy fucking smile, holy shit"
SG420123,"Pot calling the kettle black, pretty much sums up the entire Republican Party."
andytronic,"**FUCK NEW YORK POST**

They and every right-wing outlet are partially responsible for garbage like santos getting elected, and now they're trying to profit off a problem they helped create.

We need to stop rewarding them with upvotes for clickbait headlines. They still exist to get people to vote their rights away, and still hate you if you don't vote GOP."
AmeliasGrammy," Lies to your face, gets committed appointments instead of the door."
Overall-Beginning-74,I worked with a guy just like George Santos. He claimed he worked for the CIA. Habitual Liar. Poor self esteem. He will get ousted no doubt. He‚Äôll piss off the wrong person and get thrown out of the club.
JTEL918,"I think other Republicans will look the other way. Now on the other hand, if he was in drag and reading to kids‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
Redditsmytrigger,The fact that the GOP embraces him tells you everything you need to know about the GOP. Hypocrites to the core.
GDPisnotsustainable,"This is starting to look like ‚Äúsplit‚Äù as in multiple personalities.  
- while I would not condone discrimination because of mental health disorders, running in an election for governance and not knowing that part of you lies cheats and steals seems dangerous.
- lying, cheating, and stealing is suppose to happen after elected to high positions... not before!

[SPLIT movie reference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_(2016_American_film))"
ghtuy,At what point does pathological lying constitute a mental unfitness for office?
skralogy,It‚Äôs almost like santos is a blackmail candidate. Like some foreign actor got Santos elected knowing he had a damaging background they could use later. But the cat came out of the bag almost immediately and republicans just don‚Äôt even care anymore.
minlo,"The world would be a better place if we all, every once in a while, dressed in drag."
CuzImBatmaann,So he‚Äôs just like every other republican?
Entertainer-Old,This is somehow perfectly on-brand for conservatives. They‚Äôll ignore the hypocrisy as usual.
Tupreme_com,"I‚Äôve yet to see anyone ""Pro"" George Santos, where do these people congregate‚ùì Please help, in dire need to a laugh."
Chueypaints,"How is this dude in the position he‚Äôs in? I don‚Äôt understand how he got this far. 
I don‚Äôt care about if he dressed in drag or not, why they let this dude lie flat out about shit is beyond me"
Glimpsis,What happened to the process of recalling an elected candidate?
jackleggjr,"There's going to be more of this. ""Politicians lie"" isn't exactly a hot take, but grifters are learning it's possible to get into office by conning the electorate in increasingly elaborate ways. There were some calls for resignation within his party, but the highest ranking members not only support him, they've embraced him and pledged to get him committee positions. They need his seat, they need his vote... he's the means to justify their ends. Same as the Jan 6th coup attempt: if there aren't consequences, this is simply the new normal."
clifmo,"Where's the direct video link, Reddit? What's the site even for anymore. To drive clicks to NYPost?"
Marcusfromhome,Katira for Congress! Perform a book reading in drag from the podium.
Khoeth_Mora,its only hilarious because he denied it so vehemently.
It_is_I_Satan,Are we sure this dude isn't just three toddlers in a raincoat?
,[removed]
domino2064,"Honestly, he's just sounding more and more like my ex - the Mr. Garrison type that is constantly looking for self fulfillment and will intentionally bite onto whatever and do whatever they need to, in order to satiate their ego, at the expense of others and whatever may truly define them as an actual person, if there's even a core to begin with."
spirit-mush,Either he‚Äôs some kind of foreign intelligence or very mentally ill.
Jerswar,"Okay, honestly, is this dude doing some sort of massive scale Andy Kaufman gag?"
BrianMcMor1,"I think the fact George Santos is a drag queen should be very reassuring to libs.  They can drop the fake indignity that conservatives are anti-LGBTQ.  Obviously, most conservatives embrace the freedom of expression"
flakeygoat1138,"Santos and Matt Gatz, should be friends or at least former business partners, if the Republicans say that transgender's are Groomers  ?"
,[deleted]
Thunder_Gun_Xpress,Love him or hate him you can't deny this man is fucking fascinating
aroaceautistic,"Ok now you guys aren‚Äôt going to mock drag queens right? You‚Äôre going to make fun of him for being a hypocrite, but not just for being a drag queen, right?"
Murky-Tomatillo91,"He‚Äôs actually pretty cute as a lady, ngl."
Interested_Party2000,"I kinda think that Santos is a closeted homosexual. Okay-I know he is openly gay. I mean that I think he is one of those people who perhaps could not admit that he was gay for a long time and developed a habit of lying about it as a defense mechanism, then developed a mentality of lying about himself. Just sayin‚Ä¶"
