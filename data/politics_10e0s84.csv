Timpa87,Reminder that in many states to become an officially LICENSED BARBER requires more hours of training than to become a police officer.
DragonTHC,"Cops definitely need to shed that warrior bullshit training they received as a byproduct of the war on terror. You are not a warrior. You're a traffic cop. This isn't Fallujah, it's Falls River. You shouldn't be expecting a an ambush at a traffic stop."
Alimbiquated,"German police get three years of training before they are allowed to carry a weapon.

America suffers from a lack of training everywhere."
Jdevers77,"The truth is cops SHOULD “shoot with deadly force” every time they shoot, they just should almost never shoot at all.  A gun should only be used in the most extreme of circumstances and not as the automatic first reaction."
fence_sitter,"“We have to retrain cops,” Biden said. “Why should you always shoot with deadly force? The fact is if you need to use your weapon, you don’t have to do that.” 

I agree with more training but not about where to aim.

The critical decision is shoot/don't shoot. It's center mass after that point."
thebigdateisnow,"Edit: please mentally change ""the"" in the first sentence to ""an"". I made it seem like the biggest issue, but it's not.

So the issue is that ""shooting for the legs"" is a complete myth. 

It's so much safer to shoot for center mass, and actually realistic.

The issue is not the shooting, but the escalation instead of de-escalation. Why does every American cop make every situation worse? Why can other countries have cops that handle things without shooting up everyone they see? 

Escalation vs de-escalation is the issue, and cops are trained to escalate."
Zab11,"This is the sort of shitty touchy feely idea the only adds fuel to the fire of Republicans.  

Cops shouldn't even be drawing their weapon much less shooting at all unless their life is in imminent danger, in which case they shoot to kill because their life is in danger and the center of the body is the easiest target to hit.  

There's a million things that need to be fixed in the America's militarized police force but ""You should have put a round in his knee"" is not productive discourse."
Luk3yboy99,"In the UK, we know exactly how many shots were fired by police each year(4, according to the most recent data), and how many officers are firearms authorised (6677). They go through such rigorous training it’s ridiculous. The guns alone are the threat"
sultanpeppah,"Biden's messaging on this continues to be weird. Like, it's clear that what he means is that cops should use deadly force less often, but unless you're at a shooting range that's literally the only reason to ever pull the trigger of a gun. 

Cops need to use their guns less, period. They don't need to be trying to blow peoples legs off in a theoretically ""less than lethal"" trickshot."
Ra_In,"The use of a gun is deadly force. There is no valid situation where an officer should be trying to shoot to wound - if lethal force is not justified then they should not be using their gun.

Training to reduce the rate that officers use their guns would of course help, but Biden's suggestion here is unhelpful."
ajax5955,"Guns are for killing. No one should EVER use a gun unless they intended to kill the thing they are pointing it at. If a person does not intend to inflict death, their gun should stay in a secure place."
adfthgchjg,Get rid of qualified immunity and they’ll be less apt to act with impunity.
SurroundTiny,"If you're shooting,  deadly force is pretty much why."
ArrowheadDZ,"I don’t think the problem can simply be scape-goateed as training.  It’s much deeper than that.  We have deep disagreements abut what the role of the police should be, what we expect from them, and what are the limits of government authority.  the whole conservative “law and order” philosophy is the belief that the police exist not only to enforce written laws, but also to enforce an unspoken cultural order.  Rodney King was beaten to within inches of his life and the officers were initially acquitted by a jury who believed the police were acting appropriately by “teaching Rodney King a lesson.”  There are tens and tens of millions of people in this country that want a strong-arm police force that takes undesirables out behind the shed and teaches them a lesson.  More city leaders get voted out of office because they weren’t heavy enough on crime than get voted out for their police departments being overzealous.  These are societal problems and not simply training problems."
Sardonnicus,Retrain the cops but also retrain the laws that protect cops. Carrying a badge does not make you above the law.
SockFullOfNickles,"Police in the UK, who don’t carry firearms, routinely disarm machete wielding people as part of their jobs.

Some of us can remember a time before the cops became so militarized. They were always quick to violence but they’ve only gotten the full battle rattle in the last 15 years. 

Our police can and should be held to a higher standard."
big_thundersquatch,"More like, why should we have an entire training organizing training our police to perceive the citizens they’re sworn to protect as enemies and deadly threats regardless of the situation?"
SoftTacoSupremacist,Treating shooting as non-lethal is wrong.
jagcalle,Maybe their training should be longer? Here in swe it’s 2years… university level… followed by 6 months as trainees on the job…
M142Man,Send them on training rotations with the British police.
EggplantGlittering90,Because they're white and scared of unarmed brown people.
cecil721,"I think what we really need is an independent board or some elected office. Solely to handle police incidents. 

Most of the outrage I see in my experience, stems from *decades* of Police investigating Police, and finding ""no wrong doing"" despite evidence that may say otherwise with no clear reasoning for absolving the cop(s).

If incidents like Floyd case are handled properly and swiftly, we can start to rebuild trust with Police in our communities again.

Also, can we get a blacklist of cops please? Or make the records of our public servants, I don't know, *public*?"
andytronic,"**FUCK NEW YORK POST**

Please stop upvoting these murdoch propagandists.  They still fully support every cop and GOP traitor, despite the clickbait headline."
clearly_central,"This is going to get re-labeled as ""Biden trying to De-fund Police"" by Fox News before morning"
Disastrous_Law_3500,"Ok, I love Dark Brandon as much as anyone else, but this is possibly the dumbest thing I have ever heard from his mouth.

EVERY SHOT FROM A FIREARM IS POTENTIALLY LETHAL!

DON'T SHOOT SOMEONE IF YOU DON'T INTEND TO KILL THEM!

EDIT: Before anyone says I am misinterpreting, this is the quote from the article:

“We have to retrain cops,” Biden said. “Why should you always shoot with deadly force? The fact is if you need to use your weapon, you don’t have to do that.” 

The implication is clearly that officers not use deadly force *when using their weapons*."
rsoto2,Disband existing gang-like local PDs and create a national police force with way heavier oversight.
dma1965,"I am in agreement with the idea of avoiding deadly force to control a situation. As someone who is licensed to carry a concealed weapon in California the rules are very strict. You cannot use deadly force unless you or someone else’s life is in danger. You cannot shoot someone who walks into your home and grabs your TV and runs out unless the person forcibly enters the residence. However training with a firearm is very clear and very universal. I and everyone I know who have been trained is taught to shoot center of mass. No shooting in the leg, for example, because a leg is easy to miss and the bullet is then on the loose and that’s how innocent bystanders get shot. You aim for the largest target available and that is the center of the chest.

My point is this, if firearms are used for stopping an assailant deadly force is unavoidable. Either the cop has to use another method (eg pepper spray or TASER), or the rules of engagement need to be re-written."
Wnahari,Because you don’t shoot if you don’t have to.
The_Best_Yak_Ever,"I agree in principle. You shouldn’t go to your pistol if you haven’t exhausted all non lethal deescalation strategies. 

But on the rare occasions you may have to use your firearm, this isn’t the movies. Shots to your legs, arms, and shoulders can end up being lethal. It’s also notoriously hard to hit with pin point accuracy when shooting at someone working their best not to get shot. 

So yes to better training on positive strategies! No to thinking LE is going to be precision shooters only hitting non lethal body parts."
Ill-Organization-719,"Retraining can't fix the problem.

There needs to be lengthy prison sentences for every cop involved in an attack and cover up."
Rando1ph,"The guy that says all you need is a shotgun's take on using a pistol. Pistols are not all that accurate of a weapon, add in the stress of using the thing in real life, and hitting center mass is the best most anyone can do. Even with all the training they get."
sgthulkarox,"I remember when police had 'To Serve and Protect..."" on every cruiser.

Now they have Punisher logos (Which is ironic to me, since the Punisher HATED cops.)"
GreaterAlligator,"Unpopular opinion: cops should receive martial arts training. This is so they have something other than their gun to reach for.

If cops know how to properly restrain someone with, for example, Jiu-Jitsu techniques, suspects are far less likely to get shot, tased, choked, suffocated, or suffer permanent injuries."
WokeWaco,Worlds largest gang going through “retraining”
aggresively_punctual,"A black comedian (whose name I can’t remember) said it perfectly: “fearing for your life” is actually an adequate reason to use deadly force. But before we hire you, we need to know what you’re afraid of. The final test in the police academy should just be a “house of horrors”…but once inside, they realize it’s just black people doing normal things. You make it through without shooting anyone, you’re good."
TheOutSideR76,Well finally a political leader that calls for retraining a mindset that has corrupted Police Departments for decades.  I can remember going through training and it was a shoot to wound/disarm. How it turned into a right to kill instead of wound/disarm is baffling.
0ogaBooga,"A better question would be ""why do we always shoot?""

If a gun comes out, it's for deadly force. Period. End of story.

Why aren't we training cops in deescalation and actual investigative techniques?"
Impressive-Listen-37,Start by training them for more than a few weeks at best and make there record fallow them it's not just blacks they lie about and shoot
sunny_yay,Eliminate qualified immunity. No one showed be immune from the law.
Addie0o,You can't reform fascism. ACAB. Abolish police.
jar1967,"Yes, they should 
A gun is a weapon of last resort it is used when all other options have failed

Improved training and equipment to give the police more options before they have to resort to deadly is what is required"
MagicalUnicornFart,"Why?

Because the federal government declared war on the people of the country with ""The War on Drugs.""

It was always a war against the American people. 

Not ust retraining...but a new metric for what it takes to be an officer. College degree required with emphasis in public service, sociology, psychology, which would include...deescalation, and not using violence to solve every problem.

Why shoot with deadly force?

because there are so few consequences when they do"
Cando21243,Cops should always shoot to kill. It’s just they shouldn’t shoot 1/1000th of the time it seems
Fluid_Bad_1340,The dead are less likely to sue
allpoliticsislocal,Absolutely the correct answer to this problem.  We have militarized the police with predictable results.
takatori,"Bootlickers: “He’s not a cop! Only cops can set policy for cops because nobody but cops know what cops go through or how cops do their jobs!”

Like, no: the community of people being policed needs to set the standards for how they want police to behave.  Otherwise you end up with an authority answerable only to itself, which is authoritarian and anti-democratic."
BeowulfsGhost,Because when they say “to serve and protect” they meant themselves…
TeaJazzer,"Give cops mandatory training every year or two like drill for the national guard. Retrain them how to de-escalate and restrain without killing them. Make it part of their professional development. 

Untrain all of this “I must scare them into obedience” bullshit, it’s obviously not working and fueling more and more tension between police and non-police.

Nowadays, I see a police officer and immediately get annoyed. What are they going to stop me for this time? What unnecessary questions are they going to ask me this time? I’m black and the last time a cop targeted me was 4 years ago. I taught at his childrens’ school in the rural Midwest."
RedsRaver,"If the police received the same type and level of introductory and on-going training as the US Army, there would be an immediate and overwhelming reduction in civilian casualties.   

To argue otherwise signals a lack of knowledge and understanding as to what that training entails and allows."
Cynical_Cabinet,Retraining is not going to do it. You need to burn the whole system down and rebuild it from the ashes. Most of the people who are cops now are unable to be retrained and need to be fired.
LostTrisolarin,"I’m a big critic of the police. This right here is stupid. They need to train in de escalation.

If you legitimately have to pull your weapon it should only be done when deadly force is necessary or may be necessary in a split decision."
DaemonBlackfyre_21,"He's right. 

The only reason I can think of why police dump whole magazines of ammunition into people is to mitigate the possibility of having to pay their victims should courts rule against them after the fact."
Er3bus13,If Republicans actually backed the blue why the fuck are they so Gung ho on concealed carry for everyone. Do they they think this will put cops at ease? You think cops are trigger happy now?
tcmart14,"I mean, people are trained to shoot center mass for many reasons and that shouldn’t change. What should change is that the gun is not the most accessible tool and should be the tool of last resort."
PineDude128,Start by reworking their union. Have them face real accountability for their fuck ups with jail time and have lawsuits come from their budget.
Cornpop1962,"Make the color code model standard for all training and put on a heavier focus and ramifications for failure to do deescalation. Also do away with qualified immunity, and take cops pensions. Oh, and let's crack down on shitty departments and sheriffs where gang culture has taken hold. One proposal off the top of my head, no more of that stupid back the blue or thin blue line american flag shit. That is how gang culture is created and the good guys who do call this shit out need to be rewarded."
GenericNate,"Because firearms are inherently potentially lethal, the only time you should use them is when the objective is to kill the target. 

Likewise it's entirely possible to miss, or for a bullet to fail to immediately incapacitate the target. Therefore multiple shots should be taken.

The last thing we need is police shooting to wound, because treating a gun as a less lethal option will just allow police to use their guns more often and in less dire circumstances.

The purpose of police having guns is to enable then to kill people as a last resort. I have no issues with that, it's sometimes necessary. 

The change to police training should not be to shoot to wound, but to use legitimately less lethal options or to better de-escalate situations where possible."
SynAck301,"They don’t need training. They need enforcement and accountability that isn’t internal. The police have repeatedly proven beyond a doubt they cannot police themselves. Nothing will change until there is enforcement and accountability that hits pay, pensions, makes them ineligible for rehire, or puts them in prison when they “oopsie” kill unarmed teenagers."
AdminsDontListen,Why do you need to gun to write somebody a ticket for not using their blinker???
arensb,">‘Why should you always shoot with deadly force?’

Because that's how guns work. They're not phasers; they don't have a stun setting.

The doctrine of what type of situation necessitates lethal force should be reexamined and how to better deescalate situations."

Tballz9,They should remember the protect and serve thing and stop pretending to be SAS operatives. American police scare me as they sometimes kill random people. I don’t want to live in a place where a drunk is tased or shot rather than helped home.
Murrabbit,"Because shooting for any other reason is still *likely* to result in death, and sometimes not the death of your intended target. If you're shooting then it should be to kill flat out.  That's not the problem. 

The problem is how frequently cops go to shooting as the resolution to whatever they're facing which is a direct result of how we train cops that the streets are a battlefield and the citizenry they're in charge of policing are the hostile opposing force."

tmp04567,"Have to agree with the dude, he has a point. Retraining's probably needed."
BlishBlash,"While ""retraining"" might sound like a good idea on paper, in practice it just means giving them more money, and nothing actually changes.

The only way things will change is if cops get LESS money, we get rid of the Pentagon-to-police equipment pipeline, and we get full civilian control over police (unlike the rogue gangs we have now)."
Savings_Extension447,Because once you pull the gun it is to kill. Cops should be trained to use it as a last resort. Too many use it as a first in situations where it doesn’t make sense.

You could show them five news articles from last year alone about police successfully shooting non-lethally at armed perpetrators, and they will not believe you. They are too brainwashed to believe it to be possible. 

I know, as I have had this exact conversation about three times in my life. At least one guy already had it in this thread, and the other guy just got quiet after evidence was presented to him. 

I once literally dug out an interview from a police chief in my country, saying that they train police officers to try to shoot non-lethally first. After already showing five or so news articles about instances of that exact thing happening.

xkrysis,"“Shoot them in the leg instead” is a non starter. 


Retraining police especially around use of force is sorely needed in America. That said, Biden is on the wrong path here and trying to shoot to subdue rather that kill is a super dangerous idea for anyone except true best of the best type elite military units who might need that flexibility (and have the training to do it with reasonable success). The average cop already misses their target entirely the vast majority of the time. On top of that, being shot anywhere has a chance of being deadly (or causing serious life altering injury) even for a healthy adult.


We need to push hard and get rid of all this warrior mentality and cops geared up like they are about to storm a drug cartel stronghold while they are out writing traffic tickets or investigating typical crimes. I am actually ok with a reasonable slice of law enforcement being trained and equipped to handle extreme situations. Hostage rescues, true high risk warrants, bomb threats, or some nut running through a crowded place shooting people. The training needs to be very heavy on when these techniques and equipment are appropriate. 


There is an argument to be made that having every officer so equipped is needed because we never know when or where such things will pop up and we need to be prepared to respond quickly. I would counter that I don’t even have a problem if many many officers go through this training, and maybe even many of them have some additional gear in their trunk for when they are first on scene to something major. But the condition should be that they are regularly trained and demonstrate proficiency not just on the tactics and equipment, but on policies and procedures around their use and the rights of citizens/protestors/criminals etc. That training is expensive and depts probably can only afford the time and training to the extent it is really and truly necessary. 


Bottom line, if Barney Fife is first on scene to a school shooting in progress you bet your ass I would like him to be well trained and realize that he needs to put on his vest and grab his carbine and fucking run in and risk his life to stop the threat. He better also be trained well enough to not be putting the kids in the school in greater danger with his actions. In every case he better be trained well enough to know what he is supposed to do and not do given his level of training and how to communicate and be effective. Not every officer is going to be capable of this level of training, and rookies won’t be there for a few years at minimum. We should resource law enforcement agencies to make sure that the right mix of officers and training level and equipment are there and ready to be used. Overspending on tactical gear for a small town police dept is a waste if they can just call the county or state and get their swat team over the once a year when it is needed."
magician_8760,"Im not pro cop by any means whatsoever but ""shooting the leg"" is terrible advice and thats how more people would end up dead.

Nuka-World_Vacation,"All current officers in the US need to be phased out with a new police force that is rigorously tested to not hold right wing ideologies. Education and training needs to be severely increased to be eligible to be an officer. We need to get rid of the current police that are nothing but a gang to protect the rich and shake down the poor for money. The countless examples of police not being qualified for the position keep happening. Uvalde should have been a huge wakeup call that the current police are not in place to protect citizens. They don't just need retraining, they need to phase out all currently employed police since they are all compromised and make them ineligible for reemployment. Even ex-police are a problem when they are still part of a gang involved with active police. The police in this country have literally become nothing but another far right terrorist organisation."

The entire culture that's been bred among police to reinforce this collective authority and superiority that they have over people needs to be abolished. Their duties need to be retrained. The structure in which they govern themselves needs to be rebuilt. They need to answer for their mistakes. Corruption needs to be bled out. Most cops don't need guns.

Sybertron,"Bad tagline for Biden but I'd go more giving police time for detainment and training around not shooting for running away.

So many of the inicidents we end up seeing are for ""they resisted"" and I go back to Japanese tactics of ""so what?"" if they are restrained they will not be going anywhere, so let them tire themselves out.  No need for tasers or aggressive pinning down or worse.  Be ok with the arrest taking longer and let the person tire themselves out trying to resist.  

The other I see too much is trying to run justifying use of deadly force.  Someone on foot probably is not going far, and at worse just letting someone go usually just leads to upset police more than anything.  But upset police & suspect at large is still a better outcome than dead suspect or bystander 99.999% of the time."
whalebackshoal,"POTUS remembers the hero cowboys, who could shoot the gun out of the bad guy’s hand, or hit him in the shoulder. He just doesn’t get it does he?"
K-August,"My heart goes out to the victims and family of those affected by police brutality and abuse of force. Policing definitely needs to see higher standards of training nationwide. But wow, this article is...something.

>they’re taught not to use deadly force in every situation that requires them to fire their weapon.

Put in other words, ""they should be trained not to do what the situation **requires""**

>The fact is if you need to use your weapon, you don’t have to do that.”

Again in other words, ""If you **need** to do something, you don't **have** to""

The pitch just doesn't make sense."
Guac__is__extra__,"As soon as his protective detail receives that training and is held to that standard, I’ll be all ears."
LaniusCruiser,"He's right, the shoot first ask questions later shit needs to end."
flawy12,"I am tired of this ""it's a training issue"" talking point.

It is not a training issue, LEO's know when they are wrong and they just don't care bc there is no consequences for being in the wrong.

It is a culture of corruption and a lack of oversite issue.

""More training"" is a way for Biden to pretend to care while not actually doing anything about the real issue."
MithranArkanere,Doesn't **re**training implies there was any training in the first place?
captnmr,"Shoot to kill means a gun can only be deployed to protect life. Because it’s very much a lethal weapon. I feel “shoot to injure” lowers the bar and allows for pistols to be used when less lethal weapons should be used. E.g. taser, baton, pepper spray, etc. 

What we need is deescalation. Cops are thought to always control the scene and never back down unless their own life is in danger. This isn’t always the right call. And it’s hard to make the right call with 8-12 weeks of training. 

In Canada, police officers receive 3 years of post secondary education at a university, then 1 year at the Province’s police academy. Canadian police officers also F up and can be bastards but they are way less incidents and they are more professional. People wanting to be policemen need to invest 4 years of their life in training."
Few_Needleworker_801,Also maybe stop recruiting exclusively from the “high school bully too stupid to get into college” pool.
Fast_Loquat_4982,The problem with a lot of the cops out here now is that they are ex military and they look at citizens as the enemy. I personally think that being in a war zone should disqualify you from being a police officer
Jaklin765,"You keep defending them and giving them money, Joe. You are part of the fucking problem."
BlueNoMatterWho69,"Cops need a serious culture and training overhaul.

Unfortunately fighting back or reforming a 100 years of the ""modern"" police force will be almost impossible. 

More training and less power is a start."
Alt-One-More,"Police officers in the US don't deserve respect, they've lost it as a profession. Hopefully they will be overhauled and gain that respect back again as servents of the public, not executioners.

My little brother was so excited to become a police officer when he was younger, by the time George Floyd happened he was in highschool with a girlfriend of color, he has no interest in being an officer now."
Sargent_Sarkasmo,"He's damn right!
Look in every damn western country.

And if you whine the criminals are armed in the U.S., ask yourself whose fault is this. Ask yourself who did put guns in their hands."
RedneckPaycheck,"Unfortunately the whole legal system is structured to facilitate this currently.  Good luck with all that.

This is just bullshit posturing, frankly I am tired of it."
Luvenia_,"Always surprises me how the people who back cops don't understand that they're not supposed to use their guns unless their life is in **danger**. Instead of pull gun, shoot, ask questions later."
jalexander333,"Got pulled over the other day, cop chatted with me asked me where I worked etc. I work for a therapy office, I'm in college getting my therapy license and told him it required 5 years of schooling and 3000 supervised hours. He was SO SURPRISED. 

He has a gun and can legally kill people, how much training did he go through??"
Modsda3,"Back in the mid 2000s I shot someone who had been shooting at law enforcement as they pursued him through a neighboring county. They had tried to stop him and arrest him on rape charges. Long story short he crashed into a strip mall avoiding spike strips before jumping out of the vehicle with a pistol. It was when he pointed the gun at me and then another officer that I fired. 

One shot, through the web of his left hand with the bullet lodging into the base of his right thumb. The gun was immediately knocked out of his hands, and as I saw it tumbling to the ground and skid out of his reach I released tension on my trigger. He ended up passing out from shock in a pool of his own blood. Detectives latter learned he had tried to make an end run to a bar located in the strip mall he crashed into in order to shoot his girlfriend, the two guys she supposedly was their to hook up with, and whoever else got in his way. He also had a rifle in his vehicle and over a thousand rounds of ammunition (discovered later).

You would not believe the shit I got for not unloading my magazine into the guy. My fellow officers just couldn't wrap their heads around the fact I had a perfectly clean chance to ""take a bad guy out"" and didn't. Honestly, the entire experience, including the disgusting jealousy that went along with being the under 5% of law enforcement who actually shoot someone they meant to saw me leave that shitty profession shortly after. The luster entirely gone."
T3n4ci0us_G,"Step 1 - de-program the ""everyone wants to kill you"" mentality that the police academy brainwashed them with"
Reddon1000,"True that! And why has this not even been an issue over the last several years of shootings?

Many people can understand why cops might justifiably shoot. But these guys are not just shooting. They are fusillading often-unarmed people with 16 (Chicago) to 122 (Cleveland) rounds! Even in the most probing inquiries, I've never heard the question 'why so, so many rounds?'"
just4funguy30,"If I had to go to school(traing) for two years to become a basic Chef, four full years to be a management level Chef; why do the police get the authority to shoot people with as little as six weeks training?!?"
z_drive_resonance,"If youre not shooting with lethal intent, the gun wasnt necessary in the first place. 

If a non lethal shot can stop them, non lethal options would have stopped them.

This is what the military teaches, so idk why people think lethal force is the result of “military style” police"
Alex_Prentis,"Because if they survive, they can sue."
Danimalx87,"Maybe not the point of the quote, but there should never be the thought of ""shoot to wound."" If you're going to make the decision to fire your weapon at another human being, it should be with the appropriately weighted result of taking a life. There is no half-measure."
zdubz007,They should at minimum have to earn a 2 year degree on law and ethics. It’s absolutely ridiculous anyone with a GED &/or HS graduate can just join any police department.
T0mTheTrain,"The first step to making cops better is to attract better people. I think policing should be a high-wage, bachelor’s degree required job. There should be a specific curriculum, along with mandatory insurance for liability and removal of immunity. If being an officer needs to be something that people want to be, than maybe the right people will take on the role"
stickyskaggs,Police officers should be college educated with a sound understanding of the law......not just ways to skirt around it.
