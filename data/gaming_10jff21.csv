Emlerith,Fuck is such a diverse and versatile word. Never have I heard it used so poorly and unnecessarily forced as I have in this game.
LostOne514,"ACG did a good review of this. There was an opportunity for the game to be good and you can see glimpses of it, but it falls short. 

The MC seems to be suffering from Velma syndrome...Being an unlikable jerk the whole time."
floba919,"I watched the demo, and I am not surprised by the reviews.

The game looked ok, but the dialog between the main character and the cuff/braclet was so cringe and poorly written that it was unbearable to listin to for 5 min. 

You have some cool mechanics and abilities, but that was all that the game had. Everything else was bad."
OptimisticViolence,All the gameplay clips I've seen make the landscape of the open world look barren with some basic assets spaced evenly about. Looks very unnatural. It looks like they needed a bigger environment team and longer development time to flesh out their world a bit more. Games like horizon zero dawn and Witcher 3 came out years ago and have waaay better assets in the open world. This looks like an early 2000's MMO landscape.
AshyLarry25,"I can handle bad dialogue and story if other aspects of the game make up for it. One of my favorite games is Dragons Dogma. Even though the story and dialogue is pathetic, the combat is amazing. Good enough that I can look past everything else. I cut Dragons Dogma some slack thought since they were rushed and had to cut content."
Derpman2099,"just looked at the specs for this game and jesus fucking christ.

why the fuck is it so resource intensive. what the actual fuck is it running that you need 24GB of ram just for mid tier settings and 32GB (!?!) for ultra.  


not to mention it has a storage requirement that rivals warzone at 150GB"
bulldoglife,The cuff doesnt shut up. So incredibly annoying. Made me turn off the sound in the demo. I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and guess the gameplay is repetitive and definitely not worth more time.
Fuzzy-Help-8835,"I will commend Square for dropping a free, playable demo. That took some balls. Fairplay - you get a taste."
iCyanVortex,Squareenix been taking the big L's  raw while still believing in NFTs.
bored-n-sleepy,"Dude we must have the same awful thesaurus, not only is it awful but it's awful."
Recrui1t,I can guarantee the PC performance is going to be atrocious per specification requirement. Just hoped that DLSS could atleast give a few frames.
Show_MeYour_Butthole,Is the game really this bad? I was really looking forward to it.
Emeraldjade,"their attempts at trying to be ""edgy"" and relevant show how tone-deaf they are to various elements of society and gaming culture. this game seems insufferable.

what makes it worse is that they made a female minority main protagonist (something is STILL relatively rare) with some of the WORST personality traits and dialogue in video game history...   it's like self-sabotage.

way to set things back"
JhymnMusic,"Its bad enough the writing is terrible, but the delivery of every line I've heard so far just sounds so fucking boring and monotone as well."
Hfth20091000,"Played the demo twice. the diologue is so bad and cringy, and it's constant between Frey and the cuff."
Moredistress,"With how much this game‚Äôs advertisement was getting shoved in my face, I had a feeling it was gonna be shit."
UltraXFo,I was expecting the rock. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the biggest piece of dogshit‚Äù
Ender230,I was really excited for this. Was hoping for a new IP that could revitalize this genre but it looks like I might have to replay elden ring again üòû.
PitchforksEnthusiast,"Not sure what anyone expected when all they really showed in the game was how flashy and great the movement skills were in the game when chaining skills together or w.e, which wasn't even all that great to begin with

&#x200B;

They put in way too much effort, while also putting in no effort into trying to make an angsty teen from modern time work in a medieval fantasy setting. It was never going to work, esp when the protagonist was going to look like a flashy turd under the spotlight that is the setting. 

&#x200B;

The idea looks like it came from the marketing department"
realnoob123,"Bought this game off marketplace for $35 and i thought for sure it was a scam.

The guy said ""its fun for a few hours.... and then you don't wanna play it ever again. Might as well get $35 for it now"". 

I now know what he means üòÖ"
oNOCo,there is an option in the settings to reduce or disable the characters comments. Once i did that it wasn‚Äôt so bad
Altruistic-Newt1323,"Forspoken, ‚Äùthe game we love to hate‚Äù"
ClintprimE,I am patiently waiting for the lunch date tomorrow to see how people will descend on this game. It is a good game with a ton bad decisions behind it.
AverageDad12,Great review - thank you
ffximike,Thankfully I played the demo. Dont know how you make such a bad game.
lumpthefoff,"I tried the demo and the controls and movement were kinda clunky and confusing.  And the parkour looked cool, and the trailer shows her leaping off and landing safely, but I lost a huge chunk of life leaping off a small hill.

edit: And my biggest gripe is there‚Äôs just something about the way that Frey talks, her accent, that hurts my throat.  Because I imagine myself trying to suppress an English accent and force an American one.  And I‚Äôm just thinking that scene in Home Alone when Kevin calls the police but lowers his voice to sound older.  kind of like that.  And it hurts my throat thinking about talking like that for a few minutes."
Happy-Pigeon,"this main character makes me want to slap her in the face.

&#x200B;

and before you start crying no I don't hate female MCs. I love Lara croft, Aloy from horizon zero dawn, Jesse from control, etc.

&#x200B;

and no I'm not racist I don't hate black protagonists, the walking dead, watch dogs2, prototype, or death loop I've enjoyed all these games with black MCs. and also GTA SA.

&#x200B;

but this girl oh my god shes fucking annoying."
Titanburner,imagine trying to charge 70 dollars for this hot turd...
TheRyfe,"Lmao if you wanna price hike your games, you gotta do better than that, suck it square!"
GuyMansworth,"Anybody who preordered this deserves to get burned.  Especially at $70.  We can just call it ""Stupidity tax""."
Foxxxyygrandpa,"Don‚Äôt tell the people over at r/forspoken they are so salty that people don‚Äôt like the game. 

I saw a comment that the cringe dialogue is ironic and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs amazing. I‚Äôm not kidding."
TheDagenator200,I read that as foreskin review üíÄ
morsindutus,"Was really looking forward to this game. New IP, graphics looked actually next-gen (at the time it was announced), but too many red flags. It's made by the people that made FFXV, one of the emptiest of open worlds. Then found out the main campaign is 15-16 hours. For an open world game, that's not great, usually means the bulk of the game is repetitive side content. I mostly play for story, and it sounds like the story is paper thin. Cuff sounds like they're trying to do Nier Replicant just with a bangle instead of a book. And finally, the main character comes off like she was written by a bunch of dudes who have never talked to an actual young person of color in their lives. Real ""how do you do fellow kids?"" vibes. (This is based on trailers and footage, so might be better in the actual game, I hope.) I'd say Frey deserved a better game, but if one review I read is true, it sounds like she didn't want to be in this game either."
mello-t,Played the demo for about 3 minute and quickly deleted it.
CaspydaGhost,Combat and movement still look flashy as hell. I‚Äôll gladly buy this for like $15 in a few years.
CrispyRif,Is this actually out? Damn. I missed the opportunity to waste 100‚Ç¨ on pre-ordering :/
PridoScars,"Face it, Square enix sucks bad at Open World."
Careful_Endbird,Can you explain why ?
Frosty4l5,"How some reviewers gave it a 9.5 or a 9.0

It's fucked, it doesn't deserve a pass for 70 dollars, if this was an xbox game it would be melted"
Fr-day,Was there any doubt?
Poluca,This year‚Äôs Anthem
sturgboski,"Eurogamer's review is already calling it 2023's worst game. That means Square Enix has back to back ""early contender for worst game of the year"" accolades with Babylon's Fall being last years title (a failed games as a service title that will not even make being live for a year as it launched March 2022 and its being shutdown Feb 2023)."
T_raltixx,[Metro's review ](https://metro.co.uk/2023/01/23/forspoken-review-why-we-wont-have-our-verdict-ready-before-launch-18148651/?ito=article.mweb.share.top.link)
Later_Doober,I'm actually excited for this game.  I had a ton of fun with the demo and can't wait for this to come out.
Critiase,"I don't understand, how do people form an opinion yet? I thought it's not out until tomorrow?"
Chakramer,"This game is definitely in a new category I'll call an ""Anthem Like""

Very good gameplay, graphics, and art, but shit story and characters I couldn't care less about."
Tripdoctor,"From what I‚Äôve heard, gameplay feels sluggish, almost like there‚Äôs input lag."
AnimZero,"After taking a look at the demo, I found the UI to be so unforgivably bad that I have absolutely no interest in this game. Why is everything off angle? Why does the UI look like it's in a fucking fish eye lens? Barf."
ShawshankException,Man I was super excited for this game. Gameplay looked super interesting but I have yet to hear a good thing about it since the demo dropped.
ACrask,"From everything I‚Äôve read lately, it sounds like this game is the overhyped 5.5-6/10 I feel it is

Plus, the whole 4080 to run Ultra can‚Äôt be helping it either"
BetterCallSal,I didn't follow this game at all. Last month says a demo for it. I played the demo for 5 minutes before I never wanted to touch it again.
C-Kwentz-0,"I'll take ""Things I saw coming from miles off"" for 500, Alex."
leet-cuube,Nice to see the protagonist from mass effect andromeda again. I missed her antics!
Spaceman1007,"""Yeah this game sucks"""
Maitreya_CU,Who made this game?  It sure as hell wasn‚Äôt CBD3
TheAtomicRanks,Is this games dialogue just repeating yourself? Is this games dialogue just fucking repeating yourself?!
CharlieBitMeMf,This game looks like gta 4 but everyone saying it‚Äôs the best looking ps5 game ever
LukeJukeDuke,"Holy shit, its the cuff! Guys look its the talking cuff the trailer kept enthusiastically talking about for whatever reason!"
Isuckmangosforalivin,So is it bad or just really fucking average?
AdderallBuyersClub,The commercial itself is annoying. I knew it would be a turd by the soundtrack in the commercial. Enough of this forced comic relief dialog.
Gearz557,Was not impressed with the demo
Booney3721,"Am I the only one here who originally read this as ""my foreskin review"" and had to take a double look?"
ReaperSound,Is it really that bad?
Butch_Meat_Hook,Colour me unsurprised
Walo00,"Some people seem to believe that this game is bad because of ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù. But when you have a MC that is constantly dropping F bombs left and right, they‚Äôre constantly nagging about everything and it doesn‚Äôt get much better with progress and they have constant arguments with a talking cuff, that‚Äôs not ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù that‚Äôs being an annoying character(s). Let‚Äôs not get started on how the MC doesn‚Äôt even want to be a part of  the game and are constantly telling other people to F off. How do you you play a character that doesn‚Äôt want to do anything? üòÇ. It feels like you‚Äôre forcing the character to move instead of getting immersed in the game."
De4dm4nw4lkin,"Im seeing alot of people talking about woke writing. I think its a flattering over-complication of bad writing. If something is badly written and tries to make a commentary that falls flatter than printer paper i feel like thats not the fault of the attempted message but the writer themselves. If you cant write a character in a focus group without drawing attention to the group directly that seems to imply you just suck at writing characters. Woke honestly seems more benefitted by being an afterthought because that mean youd have to have actually gotten someones attention on the merit of the character or story first and foremost giving you room to put your message in.

Im no expert but thats what i can make out from where i stand."
Post_Guy,ƒ∞ts a piece of dog shit
throwawaypackers,"I don‚Äôt know how Ella Balinska keeps getting roles.

She‚Äòs been absolutely atrocious in every role I‚Äòve ever seen her in. The ultimate nepo baby if ever there was one."
Weegee256,"We‚Äôre marking fuck as NSFW now? What is this, YouTube?"
Alberot97,Yet another overpriced game that falls flat to deliver it's proposed value... Guess you can see a pattern.
Netherx3,"All I've seen of it is that its full of quippy MCU-Esque ""he's right behind me isn't he"" humor, which is the reason I stopped cons00ming anything with Disneys name attached to it, and also why I won't touch this with a 20ft pole."
obiwanconobi,"I rarely see a game that people on the internet actually seem to enjoy these days. Yet most of them will tend to be fairly enjoyable games if you don't overhype your own expectations

Like the main criticisms I've seen from this game so far is that the dialogue is bad. Now idk if this is just me, but I expect the dialogue in games to be bad, it usually is. Good dialogue is a fucking rarity in games. I'm usually playing for the games mechanics"
nanosam,Should have named the game Foreskin - and just made into a penis simulator and would have been instantly better.
TheLieAndTruth,"1. Why this game looks like it's from 2012 and needs a quantum computer to run it on high? 

2. The unwanted companion trope does not work that way, at least at some point they should be really friends to make it impactful at the end, but the girl is just mean to anyone. 

3. She does not have any development on the story, in the end she still like ""I want this place to burn because I don't care about anything and watch out, I might steal your shit too"".

4. Stop with this one liners. 

5. Stop taking away control from the player. 

6. Why every cutscene needs a fade to black loading screen lmao. 

7. A lot of parts of the world looks like a Unreal Engine youtube tutorial of like ""how to create your world with 10 steps"". Looks empty, motionless, dead."
redmagicjay,I had a feeling it was going to be bad based on that one twitter ad
garrettf04,"I remember being excited about this game when I first heard about it, but something about the ads I've seen thus far have just sapped my enthusiasm.  I guess it's the thought that if the advertisements, which get to pick and choose the absolute best and most exciting parts of a game, seem bland and uninspired, I assume that the game must be horrible.  I had some free time this weekend but just couldn't muster up the enthusiasm to download the free PS5 demo.  Maybe when this is $5 at Gamestop I'll give it a try."
RockhardMoose,Square Enix is bad at making games
JohnnyJayce,Maybe it's worth to play the game in japanese voice? Based on what I've heard from the english va.
WeefBellington24,Contemplating just switching to console again because I can‚Äôt afford to keep upgrading my PC every year to keep up with specs
ShowtimerHD,I hope this crashes
muffinTrees,$70
JmWallSeth,I have rarely heard a so vulgar coarse main character. Just imagine with the new YouTube's moderation rules. You'll have some biiiiiiip every second of each streams of gameplay. üòÖ
Harkot,"I‚Äôm predicting in the next few days :

¬´¬†Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt like that 9/10 on IGN game cuz y‚Äôall racists white cishet males with tiny dicks of course¬†¬ª"
KinkyHuggingJerk,"When they did a showcase late last year showing some of the gameplay footage, I immediately saw several concerns: the sync between spoken dialogue, the animations for dialogue, and some stuttering in combat led me to believe it was not going to as smooth a ride as the transversal system looked to be.  


I could barely tolerate SquareEnix's *Guardians of the Galaxy* in 2021 for the back and forth egging between characters (even if it was somewhat true to the canon) with how *constant* it was. This looked to upscale that.  


I was really excited to see the potential for a strong, female-led POC protagonist, especially given the TV adaptation of *Kindred* (cause between Octavia Butler and NK Jeminsin, I'm not sure who else has written stellar POC-protagonists - not to say they are the only ones to have done so, but that they have done so *extraordinarily* well). But.. man.  
Every little bit more I learn about how this game plays out has me losing hope that SquareEnix can't put out *stories* as well as they used to."
ACrispyPieceOfBacon,"Did anyone actually think this would be a good game?

It looked Iike it was going to be cringy, with a poor story from the get-go."
kumdragon,This game looks like the direct result of shitty marvel humor infecting other projects.
NormanAJ,"People find a new game to hate. Typical reddit moment.

Those cringe dialogs in every 2nd AAA game released for the past 5 years. 

Even Forza 5 which is a great game - have cringiest dialogs."
aj_ramone,"It has a female PC. All criticism is going to be called misogynistic. 

The same traits in a male character would be just as awful but it doesn't matter because ""representation""."
,[deleted]
DrearyR6,I don‚Äôt really understand the hate for this games dialogue. Lots of the same people I see complaining about the dialogue in this game were praising High On Life and Devil May Cry. 2 games with some of the most obnoxious dialogue ever
Ungreth,"The games good. Not GOTY worthy or anything, but the action is fast, fluid and fun, and the story is reasonably engaging. I've played a good 15 hours so far and I'm having a blast. Game could have used a little spicing up a bit in the visual department and better dialogue writing, but otherwise it's fine."
SissyBearRainbow,I'm looking forward to trying it
ven_,The demo should have been enough for this game to get literally zero sales.
Dr-titsntoes,"Lol, the reddit hivemind is going full force on this game. You all really want the game to flop. I'll never get how or who drives the hivemond on what kids will complain about next."
MonteCristo85,I downloaded the demo to try (trying to less profligate with my gaming purchases) and I'm glad I did because I hated it. Seems very clunky to me.
