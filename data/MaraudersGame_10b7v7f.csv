MortgageAnnual1402,He is going prestige...
JWARRIOR1,The daily ‚Äúhe‚Äôs prestiging‚Äù post
Finall3ossGaming,This is likely a player about to prestige you got a nice gift!!
StateGreen9700,I had someone drop a barrel backpack full of gold bars to me before I sold them all and didnt have any problems.  I would just assume it's someone whose about to prestige and wanted to make someone's night.  Sell it and treat yourself for a bit.
Codilliam,Just take it and don‚Äôt post it like a white knight. Take it and sell the shit easy cash.
dynex811,"I didn't just drop my pack when I prestiged but I definitely did a few runs with a bunch of valuables and just a luger. Figured it would be more fun/funnier than just losing the items. 

Nothing in that pack screams hacking to me imo"
NoBullfrog2,He was going to prestige and just didn't want his hoard to go to waste so he gave it to some random dude
Morality01,"I like this tradition, it's quite wholesome. 

Side note that I just thought of. If you have a friend in game and you give them all your stuff, could they give it back after you prestige?"
deadlydickwasher,"Devs don't ban for any items, even grenades and other unobtainables, there's not a single case. People just say so to discourage people."
Immortan-Moe-Bro,I love seeing these posts. I think I‚Äôm going to hold off on my prestige when I get there so I can help my friends get to prestige then I‚Äôm going to go hand out all my shit just like this. That or do the Luger thing u/dynex811 mentioned in another comment.
METTTHEDOC,Just use it man üëç
TTV_xxero_foxx,"There's nothing you're doing wrong unless you know he's hacking and arranged a handoff, but otherwise it's your loot! Some people like to give prestige gifts to the community"
Crow-Dragon-1226,If it were full of scrap bombs. ( That are not in the game yet. ) Then I would say yes.
SchufAloof,"A hacker would have filled it, just my opinion."
ShamrockJesus,"Only thing that's tough to possibly believe is the two bars,.Im too unlucky and have only seen one"
nichehoward,obviously and delete this post for removing evidence lol
Few_Bad_4951,"I reckon its an inside job.. the developers want to ban you when you loot the corpse.
You'll probably buy the game again and if not you'll be putting less strain on their servers ü§î"
SolidSufficient2668,Keep it he‚Äôs just prestiging
