ttgx1000,Soomersloop core arc reactors and iron man suits.
BumpFuzzMaster,It could use Sam ore so we have something for it.
ronhatch,"Perhaps, but I don't feel like there's a gameplay need for anything beyond nuclear, nor interesting tradeoffs to be made with fusion that would make it distinct from the power sources we already have."
FarmerHandsome,"Hmmm... what if they add this, but you needed a huge amount of seed energy to start the reaction thus requiring an initial investment into nuclear fission to jump start fusion."
UristImiknorris,"I can see it happening. We could get a way to produce hydrogen gas, pump it continuously into a fusion reactor, and periodically receive iron as waste."
Lemme_eat_your_pvssy,"Eh 630GW waste free isn't too shabby, with more power with the recipes I have I'd simply run out of resource nodes to put an MK3 miner on. Wish the map was infinite and iteratively generated like Factorio 's was (no border at all, just keeps growing until you run out of ram and the game crashes, so to avoid crashes you simply stopped exploring the map edges/pushing back the fog of war or got more ram, 128Gb would have you exploring for several lifetimes, at least with that game)."
Matix777,Nuclear already makes a fuckton of energy. Idk if we need a new power source
XenonGame,Too clean for the game
HistorianPristine,I would prefer to have a Dyson-sphere for my amount of energy consume.
CXgamer,Fusion is also nuclear power.
skepticalmiller,Fusion power would be nice to add with more stuff to build and all those WIP things become useful along with SAM ore.
Peakomegaflare,...I mean I just want a skyblock style game mode. It'd be an interesting experience.
Twosliceofbread,120 000MW Jumpstart. For 8 hours. Reactor consumes 28 plutonium waste per minute. 60 after 8 hours and start producing 40 000mw
Pirwzy,Curious what the fuel would be.
BdBalthazar,"Nuclear Power plants provide a ton of power in exchange for being a massive pain to set up, a new power source that provides even more power will likely involve something to balance it out.

My guess is either;

1. It requires rare and limited resources.
2. It requires an absolutely ludicrous amount of resources.
3. It requires a massive initial power investment.
4. They find a way to make setting it up an even bigger chore than Nuclear already is."
Casual-Dictator,I think it'd be too clean for Fiscat. Somehow it'd have to create waste or destruction to really fit. I don't see how fusion would do that.
Recent_Log3779,"Fusion is too clean of a power source, theyâ€™d never do it"
