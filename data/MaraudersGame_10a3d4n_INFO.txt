{"Title": "125 hours - no cheaters", "Post Text": "Title\n\nI\u2019m at 125 hours so far between last wipe and current, and have yet to encounter a blatant cheater. \n\nI frequent the Reddit and discord so yes I know they exist. Yes it sucks when you die to one. \n\nBut in my person experiences it\u2019s not as often as the subreddit would make you think. \n\nOnly posting this for the lurkers. Most people post reviews when they are upset. Im having a blast and when I inevitably die from a cheater it\u2019ll be the exception not the rule.", "ID": "10a3d4n", "Score": 50, "Total Comments": 38, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/10a3d4n/125_hours_no_cheaters/"}
