Cynyr,Not pictured: Skipping bathing.
Victor882,"Wait till he finds out the less sleep, live debuffed and cope with drugs strat"
SplitPerspective,Work: unskippable cutscene
Alzward,played a lot of neon white recently and it's a great time but once I'm in the zone for a while I get ***real*** twitchy
HiveMindKing,45 minutes aimlessly on my phone negating it all
Zaynara,sudden death -57 years.
Lithuim,Play enough racing sims and youâ€™ll always be tempted to hit those apexes.
C__T__P,Off camera he learns that the 7 minutes he saves by not cooking dinner doesnâ€™t weigh up to the hours upon hours spent on the toilet due to salmonella poisoning.
Abradachi,"Just put a toaster in the tub and jump in, it saves a lot of time"
Silver3602,"Ngl, thought I was in r/adhd. Regardless, I still got a kick out of it"
blackmobius,"Ive been speedrunning sex for quite some time!

*-80 seconds*"
AutoEuphoria,"You can also save 5 minutes or so by not showering. Not only do you save on time there, but it also makes movement more efficient, as your thighs will be properly greased up and people will naturally get out of your way due to the awful stench! Pro strat!"
FannyBabbs,"I see a lot of people using the ""reckless driving"" tech, but if you do the math the time saved doesn't add up to a lot and you can put yourself into a resource pinch later on, assuming you don't just wipe your run on a random encounter."
alonedead,Corner cutting is actually dangeeous move. If you cant pull it of you will get +45 years to your speedrunning timer
Dr_BigPat,I'm very anti-morning so I've slept with my next day clothes on countless times
Isair81,I strive to be this efficient in life.
timtucker_com,"If you think corner cutting is great, just wait till you try clipping through buildings."
NotObviouslyARobot,"Not pictured: 

* Speedrunning Romance via Ladies of Negotiable Affection.
* Speedrunning childrearing by adopting teenagers."
b4ttous4i,"If you skip sleeping, that's about an 8hour time save you can implement every day. Driving to work is probably 1hr a day minimum. You don't need to cook every day when you're saving on gas and rent. So you can raw eggs on Uber eats..

I saved you about 9 hours a day."
BookByMySide,"Nice, i am going now to read this on webtoon"
Logan-with-a-Z,Finally!!! It's been a while. Fantastic work as always!
fourleggedostrich,Where's the punchline?
atre324,Important difference is not being able to die over and over
Radjago,That last panel looks more like an intentional death.
ILikeLenexa,"If you work from home, you can skip out on the entire commute."
,the issue is skipping something important then going on to waste your time talking to someone for no reason
McManGuy,"This dude is damage boosting his way to work.

> ""Health is a resource!"""
Quantum-Bot,"My morning routine doesnâ€™t need to be perfectly optimized, since Iâ€™m limited to public transportation which operates on a frame rule system."
dedicated-pedestrian,7 minutes to cook an egg? That's below casual. That poor egg is ruined.
happyhappyfoolio,"I'm being a dork here, but there's a song from the musical ""The Pajama Game"" that describes this comic perfectly. It's titled ""Think of the Time I save""."
HellHeater,you really should have put -30 years at the end instead of 3 seconds
YeOldSpacePope,He's already behind the top runners who died at birth.
KyojinkaEnkoku,Speedrunning seggs?
Fly_Boy_1999, I actually did the sleeping clothes technique when I was in highschool.
Dickpuncher_Dan,The cherry on top is when you dive into your bed at 22:59 and your friend is standing by and smacks you very hard in the head with a big wet ham so that you go straight into REM.
gigaswardblade,-3 seconds to living
potheadpig,"thanks, im gonna start calling my reckless driving speed-running strategies"
BizzyM,7 minute abs
Kaltor,It's possible to any% life very quickly but I think it's a bad idea.
luxi_yes,"I feel like the cooking skip is unnecessary and risky. You risk getting the food poisoning debuff and a -2 morale. Not eating at all would be faster and only applies a small hunger debuff that can be negated in the unskippable ""lunch break"" cutscene"
Songar87,[Makes me think of this gem. ](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Yefaz8kvs94&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)
ColoringBookArtist,I only do this at work. I'm very good at my job lol. But when I'm home? Takes me an hour to clean the kitchen.
gerkin123,"If I'm late to work some mornings, I'll go to my garage, crouch, and walk backwards into the corner facing the approximate direction of travel. When I then jump and turn, I clip through the wall and go soaring. I hot swap my work bag for my umbrella when I hit the apex of the arc, and then float for a couple minutes as the trees start rendering. Usually cuts off about a minute."
somepersonoverthere,"Welcome to corporate america.

If you want to really optimize, look into polyphasic sleep https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_and_polyphasic_sleep

Or don't and live a happier life."
BarnabyColeman,FYI people do the raw egg thing all the time! It just creeps a lot of people the f out.
eeveeplays50040,He's speedrunning life alright.
Shwiftypants95,No amount of money ever bought a second of timeâ€¦
DeadlyPancak3,ADHD be like
FrankieMcGigglefits,"I don't think the artist, or op, had seen a modern speedrun"
zdakat,"I've been playing Teardown and it's like that lol. ""If I take a moment  to tear down the corner of this building, I can shave a second off my time!"""
JosePawz,Need to age quicker? Pop a few sleeping pills every night
TylrLS,r/comedycemetery
Sharpshooter188,I do the first 2. lol
itwasnttmee,"Trash run, he would get to work faster if he punched a wall while crouch spamming 23 times till he fell through the map and well skated across map into his work place from the south wall. That would literally shave off 25 minutes off of his run."
LegendaryHooman,Fucking psychopath sleeping in jeans.
cops_r_cringe,turning your boss upside down like the dork he is and shaking the change out of his pockets so you can make a month's worth of money in 20 seconds and save time not working
Bruhmasterr1414,Wait who doesnâ€™t sleep with the clothes their gonna wear the next day
AlreadyAway,In honor of AGDQ?
goodolarchie,"It's so weird to me that speedrunning has entered the mainstream zeitgeist. Eventually people realize that speedrunning is pretty cool, and I think streaming is what really did it. It was such a niche thing and I was super into it back in the 2000s. I remember when the first agdq happened, it was like I finally found my people. And I still know guys who are trying to break their own records that were set back then for games most of you rightfully have never heard of.

But one of the best things about this community is it's the opposite of Gatekeeping. You either find something cool as a way to save time on the speed run and start the grind or you're one of many Observers."
kickflip2indy,"Yeah, that's parenting in the nutshell ðŸ¤£"
Ok-Health-7096,More like salmonella speedrunðŸ’€
IceFire2050,Sleeping clothed only saves 30 seconds?
I_BE_GAMING,"My dad was always speed running in the 80s, weird..."
maki23,Adjusting everything for a night shift of gaming.
Matthy8,ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
SpHoneybadger,"Instead of eating breakfast at home eat it at work.

Working out? Work out at lunch break by having separate clothes, wipes, and deodorant.

Speed run tips extended!"
cataclysmicterrain,"clearly he isnt optimizing enough

a real speedrunner would not even sleep or eat"
stidavid123,"Sounds like me playing games like I do everyday. Now I realize I do it too much and thanks for reminding me. My only hobby, outside of watching old films, is playing games, so I do this a lot. This is very funny, I hope to see more stuff like thisðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬"
LilacAndElderberries,"Not true cuz gamers especially speed runners don't go out or do anything themselves while their parents continue to now do the bare minimum to keep them alive after having given up on any hope they ever had for them.

Parents probably regret not saving -40 years all because of that one mishap"
memelord793783,I was playing clash of clans a few weeks ago got 3 stars in 37 seconds in a friendly challenge he eventually just changed the layout so I couldn't shave any more time off because he couldn't stand to see someone getting a subminute 3 star on him
