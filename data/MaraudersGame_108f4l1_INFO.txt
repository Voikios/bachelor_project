{"Title": "Can we please put a health threshold on breaching player ships?", "Post Text": "I propose a change that player ships cannot be breached by escape pods unless they are at ~45% health. Perhaps that's too low, the exact number doesn't matter but the point being that I'm sick of winning space combats only for it to literally not matter at all. The fight should have to be at least close for it to GET to a boarding situation. \n\nIf I destroy another crew then the escape pods should be for escaping,  or for the winning crew to board. It's the most annoying thing ever to just have that part of the game feel nearly meaningless, whether you win or lose its going to end up being the same combat situation, which I find to be quite unsatisfying. This will make the ship to ship feel way more rewarding while still having boarding be plenty common,  just with a slight emphasis on the winning crew boarding for loot rather than the losing crew boarding for revenge.", "ID": "108f4l1", "Score": 65, "Total Comments": 191, "Post URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MaraudersGame/comments/108f4l1/can_we_please_put_a_health_threshold_on_breaching/"}
