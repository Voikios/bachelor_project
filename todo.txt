Network we need to end up with:
For every user we need a node value (embedding calculated exclusively on post title(s) reduced to a single number)
Edge values are going to be based on a users comment to a post (based on text of comment, single number -1 for negative
sentiment +1 for positive sentiment), these will be directed edge values (to indicate which user commented on 
which other users post)

TODO:
 - modify scraping to have post author and post title text etc.

 - get two dataframes:
	- df_post with columns: post_text, post_author, post_id (done)
	- df_comment with columns: comment_text, comment_author, post_id (done but slightly differently)
	- (bear in mind df_comment should only include comment_authors that have made posts)
	- need to change into functions that can be put together to work on any given subreddit
		- should save final datasets so we dont have to rerun things
		- save gephx files for each subreddit network

 - need to figure out sentiment of comments (done with happyTextClassification)
 - need to figure out single value embedding of post titles (done - reduced to 1 dimension)

EXTRA TASKS

Data cleaning:
 - exclude bot comments?
 - exclude auto-mod comments?

Aidan:
 - fix comment inspection to not do averages of embeddings again
