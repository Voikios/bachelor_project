Network we need to end up with:
For every user we need a node value (embedding calculated exclusively on post title(s) reduced to a single number)
Edge values are going to be based on a users comment to a post (based on text of comment, single number -1 for negative
sentiment +1 for positive sentiment), these will be directed edge values (to indicate which user commented on 
which other users post)

TODO:
 - modify scraping to have post author and post title text etc.

 - get two dataframes:
	- df_post with columns: post_text, post_author, post_id
	- df_comment with columns: comment_text, comment_author, post_id
	- (bear in mind df_comment should only include comment_authors that have made posts)

 - need to figure out sentiment of comments
 - need to figure out single value embedding of post titles

EXTRA TASKS

Data cleaning:
 - exclude bot comments?
 - exclude auto-mod comments?

Aidan:
 - fix comment inspection to not do averages of embeddings again
